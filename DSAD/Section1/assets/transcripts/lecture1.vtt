Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/282-0
00:00:03.946 --> 00:00:05.456
Yeah, we'll talk about all that
SAURABH.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/301-0
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:09.683

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/301-1
00:00:09.683 --> 00:00:10.486
the details.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/326-0
00:00:20.826 --> 00:00:23.785
File says there is one stream
app which works in offline mode

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/326-1
00:00:23.785 --> 00:00:24.166
as well.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/334-0
00:00:24.176 --> 00:00:24.886
Uh, can we have?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/342-0
00:00:24.896 --> 00:00:27.656
That is it's stream option in
teams.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/360-0
00:00:27.786 --> 00:00:30.590
I'm not really sure, maybe you
can just drop in an email to

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/360-1
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:30.776
OPS.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/376-0
00:00:31.686 --> 00:00:37.106
Yeah, but what I am aware is you
cannot download these videos.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/395-0
00:00:37.116 --> 00:00:40.816
It is an in app just like you're
say, Netflix, hot star or prime.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/417-0
00:00:40.826 --> 00:00:43.833
Whatever you'll be able to, you
know, if you download it even

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/417-1
00:00:43.833 --> 00:00:46.646
without Internet, you will be
able to watch those videos.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/429-0
00:00:46.956 --> 00:00:48.686
But it will not come out of the
app.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/447-0
00:00:49.096 --> 00:00:52.052
Not like you download it as an
MP4, you know share it across

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/447-1
00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:52.536

00:00:52.546 --> 00:00:53.306
That is not possible.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/474-0
00:01:03.326 --> 00:01:06.124
We'll just give it another two
minutes and then we will get

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/474-1
00:01:06.124 --> 00:01:06.776

and if you're doing so, it'll
automatically allow you only

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/546-2

so on.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/560-0
00:01:29.376 --> 00:01:31.756
Yeah, because this recording

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/625-1
00:01:49.331 --> 00:01:49.646
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/628-0
00:01:56.626 --> 00:01:56.956
Yes.

00:01:57.206 --> 00:01:59.479
So then you have a full day
Saturday class and Sundays.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/647-1
00:01:59.479 --> 00:01:59.966
You're free.

Yeah, that is for the first
semester.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/690-0
00:02:02.646 --> 00:02:06.255
And as you progress in your
Mtech, maybe in your second or

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/690-1
00:02:06.255 --> 00:02:10.169
third semester, it also depends
on the courses you're you take,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/690-2
00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.536
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/698-0
00:02:10.546 --> 00:02:12.246
Maybe three courses on a
Saturday?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/726-0
00:02:12.256 --> 00:02:15.629
One course in a Sunday or, you

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/726-1
00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.076

00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:21.806
Yep, Python classes are over
right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/741-0
00:02:22.706 --> 00:02:23.246
What about that?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/762-0
00:02:24.866 --> 00:02:28.124
So all of you heard, did you all
practice Python And are you all

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/762-1
00:02:28.124 --> 00:02:29.126
comfortable with it?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/778-0

How is this different from
regular batch?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/795-0
00:02:45.106 --> 00:02:46.286
What do you mean by regular
batch?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/800-0
00:02:46.326 --> 00:02:47.416
You are the regular batch,
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/805-0
00:02:54.336 --> 00:02:54.936
OK, OK.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/807-0
00:02:54.946 --> 00:02:55.056
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/809-0

00:02:56.706 --> 00:02:57.796
We'll just give it a minute.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/824-0
00:02:57.866 --> 00:02:59.446

00:03:03.186 --> 00:03:05.136
If you're not practiced enough,
it's still good time.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/843-0
00:03:05.186 --> 00:03:06.236
You can, you know, get started.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/847-0
00:03:06.246 --> 00:03:06.976
You can practice it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/858-0
00:03:15.086 --> 00:03:16.296
No, no, not handwritten.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/861-0
00:03:16.306 --> 00:03:16.606
And so on.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/866-0
00:03:16.616 --> 00:03:17.656
I'll talk about everything.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/868-0
00:03:17.666 --> 00:03:17.856
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/877-0
00:03:17.866 --> 00:03:20.036
Please hold on for a couple of
minutes.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/892-0
00:03:20.386 --> 00:03:23.396
We will talk about all the, you
know, integrities of the course.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/914-0
00:03:24.366 --> 00:03:28.341
Yeah, everything will first, you
know, spend a good 20-30 minutes

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/914-1
00:03:28.341 --> 00:03:29.726
in discussing all this.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/936-0
00:03:30.446 --> 00:03:33.874
Ohh it'll all be covered in my
deck and then we will, you know,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/936-1
00:03:33.874 --> 00:03:34.516
have a look.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/952-0
00:03:35.086 --> 00:03:37.719
Not will, but regular for the
folks who join as a regular

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/952-1
00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:38.036
degree.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/959-0
00:03:38.446 --> 00:03:39.386
You mean on campus?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/961-0
00:03:39.396 --> 00:03:40.056
Students right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/967-0
00:03:40.266 --> 00:03:41.696
It is the exact same course.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/976-0
00:03:41.866 --> 00:03:43.296
Yeah, it is the exact same
handout.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1006-0
00:03:43.306 --> 00:03:46.111
It is the same, you know,
course, and that is why I keep

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1006-1
00:03:46.111 --> 00:03:48.816
telling, you know, we'll
students to take it seriously

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1006-2
00:03:48.816 --> 00:03:50.636
because the course doesn't know
you.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1036-0
00:03:50.686 --> 00:03:53.782
Yeah, it doesn't know if you are
a 20 year old sitting on campus

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1036-1
00:03:53.782 --> 00:03:56.116
or you know all your work
commitments and so on.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1046-0
00:03:56.426 --> 00:03:57.816
It is the exact same textbook.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1067-0
00:03:57.826 --> 00:04:02.675
It is the same exact same course
and exact same evaluative

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1067-1
00:04:02.675 --> 00:04:04.976
components like C1C2C3 yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1094-0
00:04:09.166 --> 00:04:11.622
But you are doing all the
classes on one single day, but

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1094-1
00:04:11.622 --> 00:04:13.216
they will have it all spread
across.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1104-0
00:04:13.226 --> 00:04:14.696
They have all the time in the
world.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1119-0
00:04:15.086 --> 00:04:17.352
They'll have other, you know,
extracurricular activities and

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1119-1
00:04:17.352 --> 00:04:17.686
all that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1128-0
00:04:18.086 --> 00:04:21.696
But the academic angle to it is
exactly the same.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1138-0
00:04:21.706 --> 00:04:23.816
It's the same handout, same
books and so on.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1143-0
00:04:26.416 --> 00:04:26.646
Cool.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1153-0
00:04:26.656 --> 00:04:29.006
I think it's 8:35, so let's get
started.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1165-0
00:04:29.076 --> 00:04:31.516
So just let me know once the
screen is visible.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1170-0
00:04:35.686 --> 00:04:36.346
Yeah, it should be.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1173-0
00:04:38.456 --> 00:04:38.786
Cool.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1218-0
00:04:38.796 --> 00:04:42.084
So welcome to the first contact
session for data structures and

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1218-1
00:04:42.084 --> 00:04:45.166
algorithm design, and uh, today
we will just, you know, get

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1218-2
00:04:45.166 --> 00:04:48.299
started with what is this course
all about and we will start

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1218-3
00:04:48.299 --> 00:04:50.456
having a look at the first
module, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1269-0
00:04:51.526 --> 00:04:54.663
So the agenda for today, we will
have a look at what is this

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1269-1
00:04:54.663 --> 00:04:57.645
course all about what is the
course handout, what are the

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1269-2
00:04:57.645 --> 00:05:00.833
books, what are the evaluation
components for this course and

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1269-3
00:05:00.833 --> 00:05:03.506
how do you make the most out of
this course, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1275-0
00:05:03.516 --> 00:05:04.856
It's a six month course, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1287-0
00:05:05.196 --> 00:05:06.726
So how to make the best out of
it?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1310-0
00:05:07.176 --> 00:05:10.735
We'll also have a look at the
motivation and synergy for why

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1310-1
00:05:10.735 --> 00:05:13.126
should you even learn this
course right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1323-0
00:05:13.386 --> 00:05:16.046
All of you have enrolled for
Mtech in data science and

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1323-1
00:05:16.046 --> 00:05:16.626
engineering.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1340-0
00:05:16.966 --> 00:05:20.147
And why is this subject called
data structures and algorithm

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1340-1
00:05:20.147 --> 00:05:21.346
design coming your way?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1343-0
00:05:21.696 --> 00:05:21.946
Right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1380-0
00:05:21.956 --> 00:05:25.550
We will have a look at that then
we will get started with the

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1380-1
00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.911
first module where we will have
a look at introduction to

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1380-2
00:05:28.911 --> 00:05:31.693
algorithms and also about
analysis of algorithm

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1380-3
00:05:31.693 --> 00:05:32.736
efficiency. Right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1385-0
00:05:32.746 --> 00:05:33.336
We'll try to do that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1390-0
00:05:34.936 --> 00:05:35.756
Yeah, all of you here.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1393-0
00:05:37.866 --> 00:05:38.136
Yes.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1425-0
00:05:38.146 --> 00:05:41.803
No, that clear what we are
trying to do, we look at all the

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1425-1
00:05:41.803 --> 00:05:45.521
nitty gritty S and then we will
move on to the actual codes,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1425-2
00:05:45.521 --> 00:05:45.886
right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1443-0
00:05:46.966 --> 00:05:50.624
So did all of you also get a
chance to look at the uh post in

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1443-1
00:05:50.624 --> 00:05:51.036
canvas?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1452-0
00:05:54.036 --> 00:05:55.206
I hope most of you know me.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1479-0
00:05:55.216 --> 00:05:58.441
Yeah, we met in the Python
course, otherwise I had also

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1479-1
00:05:58.441 --> 00:06:00.456
posted and you know canvas,
right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1522-0
00:06:01.426 --> 00:06:04.942
So we have two sections in this
course for this class, so I'll

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1522-1
00:06:04.942 --> 00:06:08.291
be handling Section 1 and I'm
the CEO of this course and we

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1522-2
00:06:08.291 --> 00:06:11.695
also have Professor Raghavan who
will be handling the second

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1522-3
00:06:11.695 --> 00:06:12.476
section right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1527-0
00:06:12.726 --> 00:06:13.576
It's exactly the same.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1540-0
00:06:13.586 --> 00:06:16.962
It's the same deck, same
portion, everything is exactly

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1540-1
00:06:16.962 --> 00:06:17.866
the same. Cool.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1558-0
00:06:20.456 --> 00:06:22.521
They could not access the
syllabus for section one and

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1558-1
00:06:22.521 --> 00:06:22.896
Section 2.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1565-0
00:06:22.906 --> 00:06:23.816
What do you mean by that?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1572-0
00:06:23.866 --> 00:06:25.436
Uh, Manisha, I don't understand.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1582-0
00:06:25.446 --> 00:06:27.056
What do you mean by Section 1,
Section 2?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1587-0
00:06:28.876 --> 00:06:29.746
Anyway, we'll come there.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1618-0
00:06:29.756 --> 00:06:32.803
Yeah, let's finish this first
introductory, you know, 1520

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1618-1
00:06:32.803 --> 00:06:35.901
minutes and then, uh, for any of
access issues or anything,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1618-2
00:06:35.901 --> 00:06:37.346
please drop an email to OPS.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1632-0
00:06:37.356 --> 00:06:40.506
Yeah, OPS dot BC at, you know,
the ideas that have been shared.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1634-0
00:06:41.666 --> 00:06:41.906
Cool.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1644-0
00:06:41.916 --> 00:06:43.086
Firstly, what is that textbook?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1663-0
00:06:43.176 --> 00:06:46.562
So the textbook name is
algorithm design, foundations

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1663-1
00:06:46.562 --> 00:06:50.136
analysis and Internet examples
by Goodrich and Tamassia.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1676-0
00:06:50.326 --> 00:06:54.106
Yeah, it's a very old book, but
it is still a classic.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1678-0
00:06:54.196 --> 00:06:54.556
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1698-0
00:06:54.566 --> 00:06:57.598
So there are several editions of
this book, and you can go with

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1698-1
00:06:57.598 --> 00:06:58.166
any of them.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1706-0
00:06:58.176 --> 00:06:59.446
There is an international
edition.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1721-0
00:06:59.456 --> 00:07:02.146
There is an Eastern Economy
edition and so on.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1751-0

So anything that suits you need,
you can go ahead and buy that as

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1751-1
00:07:05.767 --> 00:07:08.798
I also told, I will not be able
to, you know, upload these

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1751-2
00:07:08.798 --> 00:07:09.106
books.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1789-0
00:07:09.196 --> 00:07:12.031
This is all strictly, you know,
copyright violation for the

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1789-1
00:07:12.031 --> 00:07:14.676
Python book, since I know the
authors, I had taken some

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1789-2
00:07:14.676 --> 00:07:17.226
written permissions and I had,
you know, uploaded it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1804-0
00:07:17.736 --> 00:07:21.066
But for this one I will not be
doing that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1824-0
00:07:21.336 --> 00:07:25.802
So it is up to you to either buy
a online copy or a actual book

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1824-1
00:07:25.802 --> 00:07:27.546
and it doesn't cost much.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1843-0
00:07:27.876 --> 00:07:31.240
It is just, you know, going to
cost you a, you know, 500, six

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1843-1
00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:31.836
₹100, yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1848-0
00:07:33.626 --> 00:07:34.476
A reference book?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1856-0
00:07:34.526 --> 00:07:36.496
Yeah, this is called CLS.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1865-0
00:07:36.506 --> 00:07:37.746
How many of you have heard about
this book?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1876-0
00:07:42.416 --> 00:07:45.396
Yeah, it's a very, very famous
book.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1900-0
00:07:45.406 --> 00:07:49.602
Yeah, it is called uh, you know
CRS, the Clr just stands for,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1900-1
00:07:49.602 --> 00:07:51.496
you know, the names of them.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1905-0
00:07:51.506 --> 00:07:51.696
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1915-0
00:07:51.706 --> 00:07:54.056
Csat for common you know, Carmen
and so on.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1941-0
00:07:54.346 --> 00:07:57.513
So it is called introduction to
algorithms and it is also, you

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1941-1
00:07:57.513 --> 00:07:59.926
know, fondly called as the Bible
of algorithms.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1971-0
00:07:59.986 --> 00:08:04.459
Yeah, aware of question is this
is a really, really good book,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1971-1
00:08:04.459 --> 00:08:08.931
but there's a caveat here that
it is also a very, very lengthy

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1971-2
00:08:08.931 --> 00:08:09.286
book.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1987-0
00:08:09.416 --> 00:08:13.192
Yeah, it is very lengthy and it
is having a lot of mathematical

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/1987-1
00:08:13.192 --> 00:08:13.546
rigor.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2000-0
00:08:14.056 --> 00:08:18.776
Yeah, typically this book cannot
be completed in one semester.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2002-0
00:08:19.626 --> 00:08:20.216
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2033-0
00:08:20.286 --> 00:08:23.333
So what I would suggest is first
complete the textbook and then

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2033-1
00:08:23.333 --> 00:08:25.999
if you have any you know,
specific topics, go ahead and

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2033-2
00:08:25.999 --> 00:08:26.856
look at this book.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2062-0
00:08:27.006 --> 00:08:29.626
They don't right away, you know,
jump with the ambition of

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2062-1
00:08:29.626 --> 00:08:32.556
completing this whole, you know,
book and you know, less than six

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2062-2
00:08:32.556 --> 00:08:32.866
months.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2070-0
00:08:32.876 --> 00:08:33.916
Yeah, that is not possible.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2101-0
00:08:35.396 --> 00:08:38.614
Of course, in uh, my classes,
I'll be pinpointing you to

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2101-1
00:08:38.614 --> 00:08:42.114
certain concepts that go ahead
and refer this particular, you

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2101-2
00:08:42.114 --> 00:08:44.146
know, Carmen book for this
concept.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2103-0
00:08:45.196 --> 00:08:45.426
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2112-0
00:08:45.436 --> 00:08:46.336
Is it clear for all of you?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2114-0
00:08:47.636 --> 00:08:48.036
Yes, no.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2119-0
00:08:50.836 --> 00:08:51.116
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2133-0
00:08:51.126 --> 00:08:53.946
So this is so and both of these
are very, very famous books.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2158-0
00:08:53.956 --> 00:08:56.988
I mean, the moment you start
Googling the name of this book,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2158-1
00:08:56.988 --> 00:08:58.976
you might find you know versions
of it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2184-0
00:08:59.026 --> 00:09:02.214
So anything that suits you need,
you can either buy the book or

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2184-1
00:09:02.214 --> 00:09:03.956
you can have an online copy of
it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2194-0
00:09:04.326 --> 00:09:06.836
Yeah, but please don't upload
anything on canvas.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2204-0
00:09:06.926 --> 00:09:09.536
Yeah, just use it for your own
reference.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2214-0
00:09:09.546 --> 00:09:11.136
Or you can share it in other
channels.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2218-0
00:09:11.486 --> 00:09:13.256
Don't upload anything on canvas.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2243-0
00:09:13.316 --> 00:09:17.531
Yeah, some of the reference
books just for you to, you know,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2243-1
00:09:17.531 --> 00:09:21.606
computer algorithms by, you
know, Sahani and Raja Sekaran.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2252-0
00:09:21.616 --> 00:09:23.796
So this is more of a Indianized
version.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2257-0
00:09:23.806 --> 00:09:23.976
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2273-0
00:09:25.146 --> 00:09:28.048
And there is also this book
called data structures and

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2273-1
00:09:28.048 --> 00:09:29.156
Algorithms in Python.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2277-0
00:09:29.506 --> 00:09:29.736
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2292-0
00:09:29.746 --> 00:09:32.134
If you see the authors here,
it's again the same Goodrich

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2292-1
00:09:32.134 --> 00:09:32.916
Tamassia and so on.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2312-0
00:09:33.246 --> 00:09:37.197
But what this book is all about
is this is more of a supplement

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2312-1
00:09:37.197 --> 00:09:38.616
to the actual textbook.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2315-0
00:09:38.946 --> 00:09:39.256
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2345-0
00:09:39.266 --> 00:09:42.874
So if you remember, this is the
textbook and the same authors,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2345-1
00:09:42.874 --> 00:09:46.424
along with another Co author,
have written another book where

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2345-2
00:09:46.424 --> 00:09:49.516
Most Concepts have been
implemented in Python, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2349-0
00:09:54.786 --> 00:09:55.096
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2356-0
00:09:55.106 --> 00:09:55.876
Do you get this point?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2374-0
00:09:57.106 --> 00:09:59.187
And there's also this slack
that, you know, illegal to sell

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2374-1
00:09:59.187 --> 00:09:59.776
in USA and so on.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2394-0
00:09:59.786 --> 00:10:02.388
So there are several editions of
this, so this also you can go

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2394-1
00:10:02.388 --> 00:10:02.966
ahead and buy.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2417-0
00:10:03.856 --> 00:10:07.526
So this is basically a book
completely written on Python,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2417-1
00:10:07.526 --> 00:10:10.436
just to supplement the other
textbook, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2432-0
00:10:10.446 --> 00:10:13.254
If I told you, you know, want
this, you can also go ahead with

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2432-1
00:10:13.254 --> 00:10:13.476
this.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2436-0
00:10:13.926 --> 00:10:14.256
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2444-0
00:10:14.316 --> 00:10:16.496
For this course we will be using
just Python.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2451-0
00:10:16.946 --> 00:10:17.976
Yeah, that is the whole point.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2464-0
00:10:17.986 --> 00:10:20.956
Why we learned Python in the 1st
place before the 1st semester?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2466-0
00:10:22.056 --> 00:10:22.206
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2473-0
00:10:23.716 --> 00:10:24.546
And this is not it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2496-0
00:10:24.556 --> 00:10:27.505
So there are several books
available in the market, because

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2496-1
00:10:27.505 --> 00:10:30.061
this is a very, very typical,
you know, fundamental

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2496-2
00:10:30.061 --> 00:10:31.486
theoretical computer science.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2524-0
00:10:31.916 --> 00:10:35.597
We have plenty of textbooks
available for this, like your

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2524-1
00:10:35.597 --> 00:10:39.531
friends were asking in the chat
right now, and a lot of other

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2524-2
00:10:39.531 --> 00:10:40.546
books are there.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2542-0
00:10:40.556 --> 00:10:43.506
I mean, is a good friend of mine
from IIT Bombay.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2556-0
00:10:44.076 --> 00:10:47.332
There's a lot of other books,
even I've heard, you know, CBC

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2556-1
00:10:47.332 --> 00:10:48.186
and other books.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2564-0
00:10:48.516 --> 00:10:51.226
They also introduce, you know,
these courses in school.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2571-0
00:10:51.596 --> 00:10:52.726
Yeah, of course.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2586-0
00:10:52.736 --> 00:10:55.972
At a very, you know, fundamental
level, but there are several

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2586-1
00:10:55.972 --> 00:10:56.806
books available.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2604-0
00:10:56.816 --> 00:10:59.962
Several, you know, Internet
resources, so you can go with

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2604-1
00:10:59.962 --> 00:11:01.806
any of them that you like,
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2617-0
00:11:01.996 --> 00:11:05.306
But the one that is the main one
is this textbook, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2642-0
00:11:05.376 --> 00:11:10.382
So 90 to 95% of this course, the
syllabus will be already

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2642-1
00:11:10.382 --> 00:11:12.366
available in this book.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2656-0
00:11:12.556 --> 00:11:15.326
And for those rest of the
potions, I will pinpoint you.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2673-0
00:11:15.336 --> 00:11:18.073
I'll tell you that you know, you
know what these concepts are not

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2673-1
00:11:18.073 --> 00:11:19.026
there in your textbook.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2690-0
00:11:19.116 --> 00:11:22.435
So refer to my slides or refer
to this book, I'll pinpoint you

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2690-1
00:11:22.435 --> 00:11:22.856
to that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2701-0
00:11:23.336 --> 00:11:26.186
Yeah, otherwise you can just
rely on this textbook.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2705-0
00:11:28.646 --> 00:11:28.896
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2710-0
00:11:28.906 --> 00:11:29.416
Is that clear?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2713-0
00:11:29.426 --> 00:11:29.866
All of you?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2715-0
00:11:31.316 --> 00:11:31.626
Yes.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2717-0
00:11:31.636 --> 00:11:32.026
No, maybe.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2725-0
00:11:37.136 --> 00:11:38.726
OK, so some ground rules?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2727-0
00:11:38.776 --> 00:11:39.226
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2747-0
00:11:39.716 --> 00:11:42.262
So this is the same thing as
your Python code, so please try

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2747-1
00:11:42.262 --> 00:11:42.846
to be regular.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2749-0
00:11:42.856 --> 00:11:43.186
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2769-0

00:12:30.067 --> 00:12:33.474
discussion forum of canvas
effectively, so this discussion

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2959-2
00:12:33.474 --> 00:12:34.686
forum is our section.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/2969-0

00:12:47.772 --> 00:12:48.586
doubts and so on.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3025-0
00:12:48.996 --> 00:12:49.346
Right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3031-0
00:12:49.436 --> 00:12:50.186
I'll show you in a minute.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3037-0
00:12:51.496 --> 00:12:52.916
So all the exercises regularly.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3042-0
00:12:53.276 --> 00:12:53.476
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3044-0
00:12:55.116 --> 00:12:56.126
Every slide deck.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3062-0
00:12:56.136 --> 00:13:00.027
Yeah, trust me, every slide deck
will have the last deck as

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3062-1
00:13:00.027 --> 00:13:02.036
certain questions or exercises.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3066-0
00:13:02.046 --> 00:13:02.206
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3076-0
00:13:02.216 --> 00:13:05.126
These are all ungraded excises,
just for you to practice.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3082-0
00:13:05.496 --> 00:13:06.386
Please try to do that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3086-0
00:13:06.636 --> 00:13:06.906
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3090-0
00:13:06.916 --> 00:13:07.966
Don't keep it for long.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3095-0
00:13:08.256 --> 00:13:09.406
Try to do that, yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3113-0
00:13:12.196 --> 00:13:15.090
Will the extra mile so I have
been telling this even in your

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3113-1
00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:16.086
Python course, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3123-0
00:13:16.096 --> 00:13:17.666
So you enroll for this course.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3132-0
00:13:17.756 --> 00:13:19.506
That doesn't mean the job is
over, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3136-0
00:13:19.516 --> 00:13:21.306
The job just starts right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3166-0
00:13:21.316 --> 00:13:24.536
So all of you are going to put
in effort that is like, you

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3166-1
00:13:24.536 --> 00:13:26.936
know, 365 one to the power 365
is just one.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3194-0
00:13:27.666 --> 00:13:31.079
But if you just raise that by a
little extra right, the extra

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3194-1
00:13:31.079 --> 00:13:34.381
effort that you put in that is
going to give you tremendous

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3194-2
00:13:34.381 --> 00:13:35.206
results, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3203-0
00:13:35.216 --> 00:13:37.326
So so try to go that extra mile.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3212-0
00:13:37.336 --> 00:13:39.576
Just don't ask questions like
you know.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3220-0
00:13:39.826 --> 00:13:41.436
I mean, is your slide enough?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3230-0
00:13:41.486 --> 00:13:42.536
Is the textbook enough?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3233-0
00:13:42.546 --> 00:13:42.996
And so on.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3242-0
00:13:43.326 --> 00:13:44.536
Try to go the extra mile.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3245-0
00:13:44.546 --> 00:13:45.596
Complete your slides.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3259-0
00:13:45.606 --> 00:13:48.436
Complete your books and try to,
you know, learn extra.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3279-0
00:13:48.446 --> 00:13:50.739
You can always, you know,
discuss in the discussion forum

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3279-1
00:13:50.739 --> 00:13:52.676
and, you know, make the best out
of this course.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3295-0
00:13:53.606 --> 00:13:57.649
Yeah, that being said, we will
first, you know, go to the

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3295-1
00:13:57.649 --> 00:13:58.206
handout.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3302-0
00:13:58.216 --> 00:13:59.106
We'll have a look at that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3322-0
00:13:59.146 --> 00:14:01.884
We'll also have a look at the
canvas and so on, and then we'll

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3322-1
00:14:01.884 --> 00:14:02.926
come back to the slides.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3325-0
00:14:03.036 --> 00:14:03.486
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3337-0
00:14:03.576 --> 00:14:05.726
Meanwhile, let me just answer a
couple of questions.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3348-0
00:14:05.976 --> 00:14:08.486
Santosh asked why Bits will not
provide any PDF as well.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3361-0
00:14:08.496 --> 00:14:11.466
Yes, it will not provide because
it is all copyright correct.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3382-0
00:14:11.476 --> 00:14:15.082
So we need to always respect the
authors, and there is so much of

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3382-1
00:14:15.082 --> 00:14:16.666
effort involved in it, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3436-0
00:14:17.136 --> 00:14:20.261
So for a couple of authors whom
we know individually, we write

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3436-1
00:14:20.261 --> 00:14:23.534
it as a, you know, but a mission
and agreement and tell that, you

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3436-2
00:14:23.534 --> 00:14:26.509
know, we are going to share
your, you know, digital copy of

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3436-3
00:14:26.509 --> 00:14:28.046
the book, free to all students.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3452-0
00:14:28.356 --> 00:14:30.557
And if they are willing, if
they're very magnanimous, they

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3452-1
00:14:30.557 --> 00:14:31.526
might be like, yeah, fine.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3455-0
00:14:31.536 --> 00:14:31.926
Go ahead.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3459-0
00:14:32.276 --> 00:14:32.746
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3467-0
00:14:32.816 --> 00:14:34.706
Otherwise, it's a very big, huge
loss, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3474-0
00:14:34.716 --> 00:14:36.756
I mean, why would they do that?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3476-0
00:14:37.086 --> 00:14:37.346
Right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3506-0
00:14:37.356 --> 00:14:40.256
So as bits we will not do that,
but there are a lot of other

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3506-1
00:14:40.256 --> 00:14:43.156
legal ways, right where you can,
you know, use your bits ID.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3527-0
00:14:43.166 --> 00:14:46.005
There are some, you know,
platforms who give discounts and

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3527-1
00:14:46.005 --> 00:14:48.506
so on, and you can actually buy
those books, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3542-0
00:14:50.096 --> 00:14:52.326
So for all of you who are not
able to access canvas.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3548-0
00:14:52.336 --> 00:14:53.336
So please write to them.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3553-0
00:14:53.346 --> 00:14:55.196
There is an OPS ID right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3574-0
00:14:55.246 --> 00:14:58.496
Even in the Python codes I had
given you, so I will also update

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3574-1
00:14:58.496 --> 00:14:59.156
it in canvas.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3582-0
00:14:59.226 --> 00:15:02.326
You can write to them about the
access right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3592-0
00:15:02.876 --> 00:15:05.046
So what about the solutions to
upgrade excises?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3608-0
00:15:05.056 --> 00:15:08.346
How do we know if we are right
or yeah, I'll talk about that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3610-0
00:15:08.416 --> 00:15:08.556
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3623-0
00:15:10.286 --> 00:15:12.416
So firstly, let's have a look at
the course handout.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3635-0
00:15:12.626 --> 00:15:17.386
Yeah, just let me know once the
PDF document is visible, yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3638-0
00:15:20.956 --> 00:15:21.386
Cool.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3652-0
00:15:21.696 --> 00:15:23.786
So First things first, this is
DSD.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3675-0
00:15:23.956 --> 00:15:27.992
This is called, you know, data
structures and algorithm design,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3675-1
00:15:27.992 --> 00:15:30.766
and the course number is DSECLZG
519, yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3681-0
00:15:32.486 --> 00:15:33.786
Credit units is 5.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3683-0
00:15:34.026 --> 00:15:34.566
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3696-0
00:15:34.766 --> 00:15:37.636
And you also have the course
author, FEBIN, ma'am.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3703-0
00:15:37.646 --> 00:15:39.556
And I have done some minor
edits.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3726-0
00:15:39.906 --> 00:15:43.685
Yeah, not much to the course,
but I have just done, you know,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3726-1
00:15:43.685 --> 00:15:46.366
a couple of Boeing concepts here
and there.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3735-0
00:15:46.376 --> 00:15:47.206
Yeah, that is what I have done.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3745-0
00:15:48.216 --> 00:15:49.646
Yeah, someone has already sent
that ID.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3748-0
00:15:49.656 --> 00:15:50.126
Yeah. Perfect.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3758-0
00:15:50.136 --> 00:15:51.426
Yeah, you will get response from
there.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3788-0
00:15:51.436 --> 00:15:54.166
Yeah, the OPS team was, you
know, loaded with a lot of work,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3788-1
00:15:54.166 --> 00:15:56.940
but they will clear all the, you
know, pending emails by, you

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3788-2
00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:57.566
know, weekend.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3801-0
00:15:58.056 --> 00:16:00.906
Yeah, by the next class you will
have all those sorted, yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3811-0
00:16:03.156 --> 00:16:04.266
Well, So what does this mean?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3821-0
00:16:04.276 --> 00:16:06.436
What do you mean by credit unit
of five?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3827-0
00:16:07.606 --> 00:16:08.606
Yeah, anyone knows this?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3830-0
00:16:16.186 --> 00:16:16.516
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3841-0
00:16:16.526 --> 00:16:18.436
Do you have any, you know, idea
about credits?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3850-0
00:16:19.006 --> 00:16:20.116
No, not 5 modules.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3863-0
00:16:20.126 --> 00:16:24.161
It it simply means a higher
credit course means a higher

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3863-1
00:16:24.161 --> 00:16:24.656
impact.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3893-0
00:16:25.046 --> 00:16:28.380
Yeah, this will in the grading
and so on it will be you know

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3893-1
00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:31.276
more of a higher impact as well
as similar is right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3899-0
00:16:31.706 --> 00:16:34.556
This exactly translate to the
effort needed.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3924-0
00:16:34.986 --> 00:16:38.329
Yeah, the hours that you need to
spend for a course that is given

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3924-1
00:16:38.329 --> 00:16:39.696
by the credit units, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3938-0
00:16:40.776 --> 00:16:43.842
So approximately so one credit
unit translates to around 30

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3938-1
00:16:43.842 --> 00:16:44.506
hours, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3953-0
00:16:44.516 --> 00:16:47.073
If it is, say, five credit
units, you can multiply that

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/3953-1
00:16:47.073 --> 00:16:47.346
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4055-0
00:16:47.356 --> 00:16:51.190
So around 1:50, you know, units
and so on and it is not very

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4055-1
00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:54.961
difficult, right around 3032
hours we are going to spend in

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4055-2
00:16:54.961 --> 00:16:59.109
classes and again another good 8
to 10 hours you will spend it in

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4055-3
00:16:59.109 --> 00:17:02.942
webinars and then uh in your
assignments, right in both your

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4055-4
00:17:02.942 --> 00:17:06.399
assignments, you will be
spending a good you know 1020

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4055-5
00:17:06.399 --> 00:17:10.295
days and put together all that
you know makes it to about you

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4055-6
00:17:10.295 --> 00:17:14.191
know, hundred 150 hours you can
have a look at these offline,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4055-7
00:17:14.191 --> 00:17:17.836
uh, I still see a lot of people
joining with guest, yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4069-0
00:17:21.036 --> 00:17:23.006
But every semester there will be
one credit with uh.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4075-0
00:17:23.016 --> 00:17:24.066
Yeah, it might be, yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4084-0
00:17:24.076 --> 00:17:25.656
There are some semesters which
might not be.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4092-0
00:17:28.056 --> 00:17:28.886
Course objectives.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4101-0
00:17:28.896 --> 00:17:29.926
You can have a look at it here.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4103-0
00:17:29.976 --> 00:17:30.986
Learning objectives.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4111-0
00:17:30.996 --> 00:17:32.926
All of them are there, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4116-0
00:17:33.036 --> 00:17:34.766
The whole content structure,
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4138-0
00:17:35.296 --> 00:17:39.291
So for this course we have a 5
modules or six modules rather

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4138-1
00:17:39.291 --> 00:17:41.976
yeah, and this is just the
module right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4155-0
00:17:42.036 --> 00:17:45.228
So you will mostly go ahead and
have a look at this session

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4155-1
00:17:45.228 --> 00:17:45.866
plan, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4164-0
00:17:46.036 --> 00:17:48.766
So the session plan is more
detailed, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4177-0
00:17:48.776 --> 00:17:51.526
It talks about what are we going
to do in every session?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4179-0
00:17:52.496 --> 00:17:52.706
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4182-0
00:17:52.716 --> 00:17:53.016
Is it clear?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4185-0
00:18:00.416 --> 00:18:00.596
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4198-0
00:18:01.866 --> 00:18:03.306
So if you see here, this is the
first class.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4203-0
00:18:03.316 --> 00:18:04.216
This is second class.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4211-0
00:18:04.546 --> 00:18:05.816
This is the 6th class and so on.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4247-0
00:18:06.066 --> 00:18:09.720
We'll have a very detailed, you
know, and then we are going for

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4247-1
00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:13.374
mid semester and then you know
for all the 16 sessions you will

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4247-2
00:18:13.374 --> 00:18:15.486
have, you know your concepts
listed.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4250-0
00:18:16.526 --> 00:18:18.576
Yeah, yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4257-0
00:18:18.586 --> 00:18:19.036
Is this clear?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4261-0
00:18:19.046 --> 00:18:19.756
Guys all of you.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4286-0
00:18:19.816 --> 00:18:22.720
And there's also this mention
of, you know which textbook,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4286-1
00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.836
which section T1 means our
textbook right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4298-0
00:18:24.986 --> 00:18:28.392
And somewhere, if you find R, it
means you're reference books,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4298-1
00:18:28.392 --> 00:18:28.716
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4306-0
00:18:30.436 --> 00:18:31.526
And also the evaluation.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4312-0
00:18:32.766 --> 00:18:33.936
So there are three components.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4325-0
00:18:34.046 --> 00:18:36.456
That is, uh EC1EC2EC3.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4336-0
00:18:36.746 --> 00:18:41.156
Yeah, EC one has two assignments
and two quizzes, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4360-0
00:18:41.566 --> 00:18:45.062
And it will be informed in
canvas and I have a habit of

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4360-1
00:18:45.062 --> 00:18:46.996
announcing all this very early.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4371-0
00:18:47.066 --> 00:18:49.716
Yeah, early meaning I'll do that
sometime today.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4376-0
00:18:49.806 --> 00:18:50.406
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4394-0
00:18:50.566 --> 00:18:54.252
So today itself or tomorrow you
can find an announcement where I

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4394-1
00:18:54.252 --> 00:18:55.726
will list all these dates.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4402-0
00:18:56.596 --> 00:18:58.116
Yeah, list all the dates.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4434-0
00:18:59.246 --> 00:19:02.627
Usually the first assignment
will happen before the mid

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4434-1
00:19:02.627 --> 00:19:06.550
semester and the first quiz will
happen before the mid semester,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4434-2
00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:10.413
right and 2nd assignment and 2nd
quiz will happen after the mid

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4434-3
00:19:10.413 --> 00:19:10.956
semester.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4437-0
00:19:12.356 --> 00:19:12.726
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4442-0
00:19:12.736 --> 00:19:13.106
Is that clear?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4466-0
00:19:14.456 --> 00:19:18.080
Set the reference to 15.3 means
textbook one chapter #5 two

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4466-1
00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.166
Section 5 exactly.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4493-0
00:19:19.226 --> 00:19:23.689
That's right, 5.3 means the
section 5.3 which is Chapter 5

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4493-1
00:19:23.689 --> 00:19:27.016
and the third sub topic or
something, yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4501-0
00:19:29.096 --> 00:19:30.436
Yeah, we'll talk about all this.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4508-0
00:19:30.446 --> 00:19:32.006
Yeah, just give me a minute.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4529-0
00:19:32.276 --> 00:19:36.625
So you see one is about 30% or
in our course let's not confuse

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4529-1
00:19:36.625 --> 00:19:37.246
all that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4534-0
00:19:37.476 --> 00:19:38.746
We will just go with mugs.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4545-0
00:19:39.096 --> 00:19:40.916
Yeah, this translates to 30
marks.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4570-0
00:19:41.726 --> 00:19:45.281
So your first assignment will be
for 12 marks, second assignment

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4570-1
00:19:45.281 --> 00:19:48.616
will be for 13 Marks and quiz
will be for five marks, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4582-0
00:19:48.906 --> 00:19:52.216
That sums it to 30 marks for
assignments.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4589-0
00:19:52.226 --> 00:19:53.666
You will be doing it in groups.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4601-0
00:19:53.896 --> 00:19:56.546
Yeah, the groups will be created
in a couple of weeks.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4609-0
00:19:56.936 --> 00:19:57.586
Just hold down.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4653-0
00:19:57.596 --> 00:20:01.413
That will be done and you'll be
working in groups and then you

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4653-1
00:20:01.413 --> 00:20:05.109
will just submit one submission
as a group, whereas for quiz

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4653-2
00:20:05.109 --> 00:20:08.622
you'll do it individually and
all of these will happen on

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4653-3
00:20:08.622 --> 00:20:09.046
canvas.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4666-0
00:20:09.776 --> 00:20:12.646
And as I told, first assignment
will happen before mid semester.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4685-0
00:20:13.096 --> 00:20:16.243

and 2nd quiz will happen after
mid semester.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4687-0

Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4692-0
00:20:19.936 --> 00:20:20.606
Is this clear guys?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4724-0
00:20:22.436 --> 00:20:26.416
And then you'll have your
midterm exam and your final exam

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4724-1
00:20:26.416 --> 00:20:30.732
right midterm exam is again for
30 marks, and final exam is 440

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4724-2
00:20:30.732 --> 00:20:31.136
marks.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4734-0
00:20:32.406 --> 00:20:34.396
And again, we have gone back to
the traditional mode.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4736-0
00:20:34.406 --> 00:20:34.716
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4762-0

So the midterm exam will be
closed book exams and

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4762-1
00:20:38.134 --> 00:20:42.376
comprehensive exam or your final
exam will be open book exams.

slides that I provide and any

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4849-1
00:20:59.127 --> 00:21:02.269
other materials that I provide
right books, meaning any

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4849-2
00:21:02.269 --> 00:21:03.896
official book should be fine.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4857-0
00:21:03.936 --> 00:21:05.376
Yeah, not just that textbooks.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4880-0
00:21:05.386 --> 00:21:08.585
Any book that you feel you will
be able to take it to the exam

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4880-1
00:21:08.585 --> 00:21:10.616
and remember this is an open
book exam.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4888-0
00:21:10.686 --> 00:21:12.616
It is not an open Internet exam.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4890-0
00:21:13.046 --> 00:21:13.376
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4905-0
00:21:13.386 --> 00:21:16.237
So you will not be able to use
the Internet while writing the

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4905-1
00:21:16.237 --> 00:21:16.466
exam.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4908-0
00:21:17.466 --> 00:21:17.816
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4915-0
00:21:17.826 --> 00:21:19.766
Print out of slides are allowed,
yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4918-0
00:21:22.886 --> 00:21:23.106
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4926-0
00:21:23.116 --> 00:21:24.096
Couple there will be an option.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4935-0
00:21:24.106 --> 00:21:25.716
I'm not really sure about all
that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4946-0
00:21:25.726 --> 00:21:28.716
You will get communication from
the OPS teams on that. Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4956-0
00:21:28.726 --> 00:21:31.696
So there are a lot of changes
kicking in from this semester.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4965-0
00:21:32.496 --> 00:21:34.496
So, uh, you can wait for those,
yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4968-0
00:21:37.706 --> 00:21:37.896
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4974-0
00:21:37.906 --> 00:21:38.346
Is this clear?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4976-0
00:21:38.356 --> 00:21:38.916
Guys, all of you?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4982-0
00:21:41.446 --> 00:21:42.336
Evaluation scheme.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4984-0
00:21:42.346 --> 00:21:42.766
Any doubts?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/4989-0
00:21:45.786 --> 00:21:46.596
No soft copy.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5008-0
00:21:46.606 --> 00:21:49.089
Also, I don't feel it is
possible if you are going to

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5008-1
00:21:49.089 --> 00:21:50.376
write it in a center, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5030-0
00:21:50.386 --> 00:21:53.076
If you're going to, you know, a
center allotted from bits.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5051-0
00:21:53.346 --> 00:21:56.173
If you're going to go and write
your exam there, then of course

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5051-1
00:21:56.173 --> 00:21:58.911
you cannot carry these in your,
you know, pen drive or email,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5051-2
00:21:58.911 --> 00:21:59.176
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5088-0
00:21:59.646 --> 00:22:03.370
So if you are using that mode,
then maybe you're not, so you'll

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5088-1
00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:07.153
have to take a print out and you
know, carry it and print out of

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5088-2
00:22:07.153 --> 00:22:08.316
slides alone, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5092-0
00:22:08.546 --> 00:22:09.566
Not the textbook.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5100-0
00:22:09.616 --> 00:22:10.116
Yeah, it is.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5102-0
00:22:10.126 --> 00:22:11.846
Again, directly illegal offense.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5125-0
00:22:12.266 --> 00:22:14.953
Yeah, someone who notices can
even you know, file a copyright

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5125-1
00:22:14.953 --> 00:22:16.556
case that you know you have
printed.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5127-0
00:22:16.566 --> 00:22:17.586
The whole textbook?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5134-0
00:22:17.666 --> 00:22:18.806
Yeah, please don't do that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5165-0
00:22:19.096 --> 00:22:21.875
Handwritten notes can be print
out and you know, maybe you

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5165-1
00:22:21.875 --> 00:22:24.983
know, spiral bind it and you can
also, you know, take a print out

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5165-2
00:22:24.983 --> 00:22:25.736
of these slides.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5177-0
00:22:25.746 --> 00:22:27.636
So all my slides are open
source.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5187-0
00:22:27.646 --> 00:22:29.536
You can print them, but not the
book.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5189-0
00:22:30.446 --> 00:22:30.606
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5220-0
00:22:31.886 --> 00:22:35.265
Yeah, they'll be just two
quizzes, one before mid SIM, one

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5220-1
00:22:35.265 --> 00:22:38.357
after modsim and we will take
the best out of two for

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5220-2
00:22:38.357 --> 00:22:38.986
assignment.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5237-0
00:22:38.996 --> 00:22:42.348
It is mandatory that you do both
of them and we will just add

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5237-1
00:22:42.348 --> 00:22:42.996
them, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5242-0
00:22:43.006 --> 00:22:43.676
This is 12 marks.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5248-0
00:22:43.686 --> 00:22:44.656
This is 13 marks.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5259-0
00:22:44.796 --> 00:22:46.736
It is addition, yeah, 12 + 3.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5273-0
00:22:47.446 --> 00:22:50.776
But As for quiz, both the
quizzes will be for FIFA marks.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5294-0
00:22:50.986 --> 00:22:54.057
We will take the best score out
of it in one you have got 3.5 in

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5294-1
00:22:54.057 --> 00:22:54.246
one.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5296-0
00:22:54.256 --> 00:22:54.936
You have got five.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5303-0
00:22:55.166 --> 00:22:56.066
We'll take the score five.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5305-0
00:22:57.326 --> 00:22:57.576
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5311-0
00:22:57.586 --> 00:22:58.096
Is this clear?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5333-0
00:22:58.106 --> 00:23:01.864
Guys, all of you, this is about
your, you know, evaluation and

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5333-1
00:23:01.864 --> 00:23:03.056
you know your exams.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5340-0
00:23:04.356 --> 00:23:05.846
Apart from this, what else is
pending?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5353-0
00:23:06.196 --> 00:23:10.474
You have your baby nurse, so
these webinars will happen on

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5353-1
00:23:10.474 --> 00:23:11.126
weekdays.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5382-0
00:23:11.296 --> 00:23:14.248
Yeah, you would have already got
a schedule that will happen on

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5382-1
00:23:14.248 --> 00:23:17.061
Tuesdays or Thursdays for our
course, and that will be taken

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5382-2
00:23:17.061 --> 00:23:18.306
by the teaching assistants.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5393-0
00:23:18.516 --> 00:23:20.066
Yeah, I'll not be taking those.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5412-0
00:23:20.196 --> 00:23:23.529
The teaching assistants will be
taking and those are some

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5412-1
00:23:23.529 --> 00:23:26.516
concepts which is not directly
there in the course.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5414-0
00:23:27.036 --> 00:23:27.506
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5436-0
00:23:27.516 --> 00:23:30.532
So directly in this handout you
will not find them, but they're

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5436-1
00:23:30.532 --> 00:23:31.286
still important.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5449-0
00:23:31.416 --> 00:23:32.926
They are surrounding the course.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5452-0
00:23:33.186 --> 00:23:34.586
Some practical applications?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5477-0
00:23:34.976 --> 00:23:38.015
Or maybe they'll solve, you
know, a couple of questions that

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5477-1
00:23:38.015 --> 00:23:40.456
is important from the exam point
of view, right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5481-0
00:23:40.466 --> 00:23:41.316
Such things they do.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5485-0
00:23:41.966 --> 00:23:42.236
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5498-0
00:23:42.246 --> 00:23:44.843
For that also recordings will be
there and you will be able to

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5498-1
00:23:44.843 --> 00:23:45.296
watch them.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5510-0
00:23:49.346 --> 00:23:51.086
Yeah, you will get the schedule
for the webinars.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5521-0
00:23:51.096 --> 00:23:53.336
Yeah, they are just 4 webinars
for a course.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5525-0
00:23:53.786 --> 00:23:54.016
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5537-0
00:23:54.026 --> 00:23:56.016
For this course the whole
semester, you'll have just four.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5539-0
00:23:56.706 --> 00:23:56.996
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5552-0
00:23:57.006 --> 00:23:58.886
So for that also you can just
watch the recordings.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5554-0
00:24:00.386 --> 00:24:00.656
Cool.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5559-0
00:24:00.666 --> 00:24:01.246
Anything else guys?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5566-0
00:24:02.596 --> 00:24:04.056
Any doubts on this course
handout?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5577-0
00:24:08.116 --> 00:24:09.726
Yeah, we don't have a lab for
this course.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5581-0
00:24:09.736 --> 00:24:10.166
So what?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5585-0
00:24:10.176 --> 00:24:11.056
It's very good question.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5605-0
00:24:11.066 --> 00:24:14.372
So what we will do is after
every session I will be

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5605-1
00:24:14.372 --> 00:24:16.406
uploading some Python notebooks.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5607-0
00:24:16.776 --> 00:24:17.146
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5620-0
00:24:17.156 --> 00:24:20.276
And those Python notebooks are
considered as your lap.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5630-0
00:24:21.286 --> 00:24:22.866
You can just play around with
the notebook.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5639-0
00:24:22.876 --> 00:24:24.156
You can, you know, try to
execute it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5644-0
00:24:24.166 --> 00:24:25.076
You can manipulate it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5660-0
00:24:25.086 --> 00:24:27.456
Try to execute it and so on and
that will be your lab.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5665-0
00:24:27.466 --> 00:24:28.676
There is no official lab.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5673-0
00:24:28.686 --> 00:24:29.796
There is no lab exam.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5681-0
00:24:29.846 --> 00:24:32.686
There is nothing you know of
that sort, yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5698-0
00:24:35.446 --> 00:24:38.933
Well, let me just now go to
canvas for example related

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5698-1
00:24:38.933 --> 00:24:39.566
questions.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5701-0
00:24:39.576 --> 00:24:40.346
Will there be?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5733-0
00:24:40.356 --> 00:24:43.921
Yeah, there will be a mock exam
and for our course I'll be

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5733-1
00:24:43.921 --> 00:24:47.848
uploading a sample paper exactly
one week before the exam, or 10

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5733-2
00:24:47.848 --> 00:24:49.116
days before the exam.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5753-0
00:24:50.396 --> 00:24:52.823
And just for you to get
accustomed to the online

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5753-1
00:24:52.823 --> 00:24:55.646
platform and so on, there will
be some mock exams, yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5764-0
00:24:58.096 --> 00:24:59.306
Are you able to see the browser
now?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5770-0
00:24:59.316 --> 00:24:59.656
All of you.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5777-0
00:25:01.506 --> 00:25:02.796
These are course canvas page.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5792-0
00:25:02.806 --> 00:25:05.558
If you have not got the access
to it, you will get it sometime

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5792-1
00:25:05.558 --> 00:25:05.776
soon.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5808-0
00:25:05.786 --> 00:25:08.416
Don't worry about it in less
than you know 2-3 days.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5823-0
00:25:08.426 --> 00:25:11.276
All this will be sorted, but
most of you have already got.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5836-0
00:25:11.886 --> 00:25:15.001
Yeah, this is the same canvas we
have learned about all this long

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5836-1
00:25:15.001 --> 00:25:15.236
back.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5841-0
00:25:15.286 --> 00:25:17.046
Yeah, alright.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5848-0
00:25:18.096 --> 00:25:19.076
You have the lead inspector.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5855-0
00:25:19.086 --> 00:25:20.086
All the names and so on.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5865-0
00:25:20.096 --> 00:25:22.646
And this is where you can
download this course handout.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5882-0
00:25:22.996 --> 00:25:25.356
Yeah, someone was asking about,
you know, how do I get that

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5882-1
00:25:25.356 --> 00:25:25.946
syllabus sheet?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5897-0
00:25:25.956 --> 00:25:28.546
Right, so this handout for every
core you will have it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5926-0
00:25:28.996 --> 00:25:32.174
And for this course you will be
able to write away come to the

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5926-1
00:25:32.174 --> 00:25:35.100
course page when you click on
this it will get downloaded

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5926-2
00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:35.806
announcements.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5933-0
00:25:35.916 --> 00:25:37.566
I have put a couple of
announcements for you.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5946-0
00:25:38.076 --> 00:25:39.506
Yeah, you can go ahead and read
it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5952-0
00:25:39.976 --> 00:25:42.226
And then there is this
discussion, which is general.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5965-0
00:25:42.296 --> 00:25:46.106
Yeah, this is common to both the
sections students, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5967-0
00:25:47.366 --> 00:25:47.746
Yes. No.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5972-0
00:25:50.946 --> 00:25:51.626
Yeah, of course.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5987-0
00:25:51.636 --> 00:25:54.006
Send out is just to download it
and I'll come to the section.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/5995-0
00:25:54.016 --> 00:25:55.436
Yeah, the section for a few
people.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6017-0
00:25:55.446 --> 00:25:58.710
Maybe it is not still accessible
and you know the back end team

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6017-1
00:25:58.710 --> 00:25:59.576
is working on it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6036-0
00:26:00.146 --> 00:26:03.033
So in this discussion you will
try to post questions which are

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6036-1
00:26:03.033 --> 00:26:04.636
very generic to both the
sections.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6069-0
00:26:04.986 --> 00:26:09.222
Maybe things like you know your
exam timetable or exam portions

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6069-1
00:26:09.222 --> 00:26:13.061
or you have some general no
query queries about the codes

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6069-2
00:26:13.061 --> 00:26:14.186
you can ask here.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6078-0
00:26:15.326 --> 00:26:16.226
Modules you can ignore.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6083-0
00:26:16.236 --> 00:26:16.936
There'll be nothing here.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6087-0
00:26:18.026 --> 00:26:18.776
Assignments.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6095-0
00:26:18.856 --> 00:26:19.616
This is where you are.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6100-0
00:26:19.626 --> 00:26:20.876
You know assignments will
happen.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6104-0
00:26:21.166 --> 00:26:22.366
Currently nothing is published.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6126-0
00:26:22.376 --> 00:26:25.316
These are all just placeholders,
nothing is there once it is

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6126-1
00:26:25.316 --> 00:26:27.436
published, you will be able to
see quizzes.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6132-0
00:26:27.446 --> 00:26:28.666
Also will happen in this
platform.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6137-0
00:26:35.226 --> 00:26:35.496
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6145-0
00:26:35.506 --> 00:26:37.596
So now coming to our own
section, right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6169-0
00:26:38.006 --> 00:26:40.754
So the moment you come to
canvas, these are all some

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6169-1
00:26:40.754 --> 00:26:43.916
generic stuff, but always you
will then come to our section.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6210-0
00:26:44.026 --> 00:26:46.642
Yeah, we will click on section
one that will take you to

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6210-1
00:26:46.642 --> 00:26:49.396
another page like this and I
understand for a lot of people

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6210-2
00:26:49.396 --> 00:26:51.736
this is still not working, but
that will be fixed.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6228-0
00:26:52.086 --> 00:26:54.596
Yeah, that will be fixed within
another day or so.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6240-0
00:26:55.086 --> 00:26:58.776
And this is where we have our
section specific things. Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6247-0
00:26:59.776 --> 00:27:01.546
What do you mean by section
specific things?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6263-0
00:27:01.736 --> 00:27:04.363
No, those are not published, you
know, Kishan, don't worry about

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6263-1
00:27:04.363 --> 00:27:04.726
all that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6268-0
00:27:04.736 --> 00:27:05.746
It will be deleted.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6281-0
00:27:05.756 --> 00:27:08.196
You will have only two
assignments, 2 quizzes for this

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6281-1
00:27:08.196 --> 00:27:08.506
course.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6287-0
00:27:08.956 --> 00:27:10.206
Yeah, please go with that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6298-0
00:27:10.576 --> 00:27:12.386
Yeah, those are just
placeholders.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6314-0
00:27:12.396 --> 00:27:15.847
When we create a page in canvas,
it comes by default and those

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6314-1
00:27:15.847 --> 00:27:17.106
are not even scheduled.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6326-0
00:27:17.116 --> 00:27:18.726
It is just a placeholder with
that name.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6329-0
00:27:18.946 --> 00:27:20.086
Nothing is there inside that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6331-0
00:27:20.616 --> 00:27:20.786
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6348-0
00:27:22.006 --> 00:27:25.666
So announcements, for example, I
want to say cancel a class.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6361-0
00:27:25.926 --> 00:27:29.816
Yeah, cancel a class, meaning it
is only for our section, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6372-0
00:27:29.826 --> 00:27:32.736
It is not for the whole, you
know, dsat course, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6382-0
00:27:32.746 --> 00:27:34.336
Maybe Professor Raven is taking
a class.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6397-0
00:27:34.346 --> 00:27:39.066
I'm only you know, on, you know,
I'm taking a all for something.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6426-0
00:27:39.076 --> 00:27:43.093
Say on that day I'll post an
announcement inside the Section

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6426-1
00:27:43.093 --> 00:27:47.241
1, meaning all the announcements
that I make here are only for

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6426-2
00:27:47.241 --> 00:27:48.096
your section.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6435-0
00:27:48.386 --> 00:27:49.806
Yeah, not for the other
sections.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6458-0
00:27:49.816 --> 00:27:52.381
So don't you know, propagate
information on WhatsApp and

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6458-1
00:27:52.381 --> 00:27:55.216
other mediums that, you know, we
don't have a class and so on?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6477-0
00:27:55.486 --> 00:27:58.743
Because whatever I post in this
section announcement is only for

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6477-1
00:27:58.743 --> 00:28:00.296
you, not for the other section.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6505-0
00:28:00.806 --> 00:28:03.616
Yeah, if it is common, I would
have posted in the bigger

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6505-1
00:28:03.616 --> 00:28:06.673
announcement section itself,
which is something here right in

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6505-2
00:28:06.673 --> 00:28:07.806
this page announcement.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6514-0
00:28:07.816 --> 00:28:09.236
If I do that is for everyone.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6533-0
00:28:09.606 --> 00:28:13.504
But if I come to Section 1 and
then post something, it is only

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6533-1
00:28:13.504 --> 00:28:14.926
for you and then pages.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6564-0
00:28:14.936 --> 00:28:17.868
Yeah, I have a habit where for
every class I will create a page

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6564-1
00:28:17.868 --> 00:28:20.386
here called lecture 1, lecture
2, lecture 3 and so on.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6580-0
00:28:20.916 --> 00:28:24.478
And inside that I will go ahead
and I will put what we learned

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6580-1
00:28:24.478 --> 00:28:24.986

00:28:34.531 --> 00:28:35.496
file section.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6625-0
00:28:35.506 --> 00:28:39.125
Of course you can see all the

00:28:39.125 --> 00:28:39.486
forum.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6644-0
00:28:39.856 --> 00:28:43.702
This is where you can chit chat
about your doubts queries and

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6644-1
00:28:43.702 --> 00:28:45.686
also about the solutions, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6659-0
00:28:45.916 --> 00:28:48.773
So can we access Professor again
class also, no, you cannot

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6659-1
00:28:48.773 --> 00:28:49.106
access.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6661-0
00:28:49.216 --> 00:28:49.586
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6676-0
00:28:49.636 --> 00:28:53.546
So it is for example, if you
imagine a real classroom, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6697-0
00:28:53.696 --> 00:28:57.769
Will you be able to go sit in
both the classroom right at,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6697-1
00:28:57.769 --> 00:28:58.666
say, 9:00 AM?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6705-0
00:28:58.756 --> 00:29:00.196
You'll be present only in one
class.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6717-0
00:29:00.206 --> 00:29:02.426
You cannot go sit in both the
class, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6738-0
00:29:02.796 --> 00:29:05.721
But rest assured, I will
guarantee you that it is exact

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6738-1
00:29:05.721 --> 00:29:07.496
same content that will be
taught.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6740-0
00:29:08.176 --> 00:29:08.506
Yeah.

00:29:10.076 --> 00:29:11.846
It is exactly the same course.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6767-0
00:29:11.996 --> 00:29:14.047
It is exactly the same, you
know, topic that will be

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6767-1
00:29:14.047 --> 00:29:14.356
covered.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6773-0
00:29:15.176 --> 00:29:17.066
Yeah, don't worry about that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6790-0
00:29:17.076 --> 00:29:19.714
There is nothing like, you know
there is extra there extra here

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6790-1
00:29:19.714 --> 00:29:20.126
and so on.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6795-0
00:29:20.136 --> 00:29:21.156
It's exactly the same.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6800-0
00:29:21.726 --> 00:29:21.846
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6808-0
00:29:23.666 --> 00:29:25.326
And in discussions, yeah, this
is very important.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6810-0
00:29:25.336 --> 00:29:25.626
Again.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6812-0
00:29:25.636 --> 00:29:26.016
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6826-0
00:29:26.066 --> 00:29:28.116
Uh, from where I can see the
webinar I will post that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6832-0
00:29:28.186 --> 00:29:29.176
Yeah, I'll post that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6852-0
00:29:29.186 --> 00:29:32.628
Don't worry about it, I'll post
about webinars as well as all

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6852-1
00:29:32.628 --> 00:29:33.516
your exam dates.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6856-0
00:29:33.766 --> 00:29:35.356
I'll post it in announcement.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6865-0
00:29:35.726 --> 00:29:37.056
Yeah, I'll do that today itself.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6880-0
00:29:37.066 --> 00:29:39.876
Yeah, can sample paper questions
where initially so that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6899-0
00:29:39.886 --> 00:29:43.350
No, that will that will not be
the you know way because that

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6899-1
00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:44.656
gives the wrong notion.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6908-0
00:29:44.986 --> 00:29:47.426
So don't worry about all those
exams and so on.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6918-0
00:29:47.476 --> 00:29:50.366
Just enjoy the course and the
exam matters.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6926-0
00:29:50.376 --> 00:29:51.356
We will look at it later.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6930-0
00:29:51.786 --> 00:29:52.736
Yeah, definitely.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6958-0
00:29:52.746 --> 00:29:55.812
I'll upload some sample papers
and so on, but I will do that

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6958-1
00:29:55.812 --> 00:29:58.776
just you know when the time
comes, let's cross the bridge.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6979-0
00:29:58.786 --> 00:30:02.885
When it comes, it's not a, you
know, ideal case that you know

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6979-1
00:30:02.885 --> 00:30:05.396
we we prepare just for the exam
sake.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/6989-0
00:30:05.466 --> 00:30:09.536
Yeah, the course video will be
available in teams.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7021-0
00:30:09.856 --> 00:30:13.246
Yeah, teams is only for live
classes and recordings, and for

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7021-1
00:30:13.246 --> 00:30:16.524
everything else, this is your
platform where you will find

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7021-2
00:30:16.524 --> 00:30:19.746
your slides, materials, quizzes,
assignments, everything.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7024-0
00:30:20.566 --> 00:30:21.136
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7040-0
00:30:21.626 --> 00:30:24.025
So similar and others were
asking uh, how do I know if the

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7040-1
00:30:24.025 --> 00:30:24.756
answers are right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7044-0
00:30:24.806 --> 00:30:25.296
Uh.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7054-0
00:30:25.336 --> 00:30:27.556
Every class you're telling
you're going to give questions.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7064-0
00:30:27.706 --> 00:30:28.856
How do I know if I'm right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7086-0
00:30:29.446 --> 00:30:33.449
So as I told every slide deck,
every class my last slides will

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7086-1
00:30:33.449 --> 00:30:36.816
have some questions pertaining
to that class, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7109-0
00:30:36.826 --> 00:30:39.404
If you have attended those two
hours class, if you have been

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7109-1
00:30:39.404 --> 00:30:41.136
attentive, you'll be able to
solve them.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7116-0
00:30:41.626 --> 00:30:42.576
Go ahead and try those.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7123-0
00:30:42.586 --> 00:30:43.686
Those are all ungraded.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7129-0
00:30:43.696 --> 00:30:44.636
That is just for you.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7143-0
00:30:44.986 --> 00:30:47.711
And once you solve it, try to
put your answers in this

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7143-1
00:30:47.711 --> 00:30:48.256
discussion.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7151-0
00:30:48.786 --> 00:30:50.956
Very important again, this is
for section one.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7156-0
00:30:51.576 --> 00:30:51.886
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7167-0
00:30:51.896 --> 00:30:54.386
Inside our section one, you will
go ahead and post that question.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7202-0
00:30:54.716 --> 00:30:57.926
Uh, I mean, you tell that I've
attempted these answers and

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7202-1
00:30:57.926 --> 00:31:00.755
you'll just upload your
solutions and these are all

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7202-2
00:31:00.755 --> 00:31:02.386
just, you know, uh, free text.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7215-0
00:31:02.656 --> 00:31:04.666
You can type it or you can
upload a document.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7236-0
00:31:04.796 --> 00:31:07.853
Whatever you like, you'll be
able to do and then what will

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7236-1
00:31:07.853 --> 00:31:10.236
happen is your whole batch will
vouch for it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7255-0
00:31:10.406 --> 00:31:12.984
Yeah, they will also solve it
and they will see if the answers

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7255-1
00:31:12.984 --> 00:31:13.516
are matching.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7276-0
00:31:13.616 --> 00:31:16.056
If your answers are right, the
teaching assistants will have an

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7276-1
00:31:16.056 --> 00:31:17.656
I they'll give you feedback on,
you know.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7283-0
00:31:17.666 --> 00:31:19.026
Have you done it correctly or
not?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7307-0
00:31:19.286 --> 00:31:22.909
And I will also occasionally
pitch in, but officially I will

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7307-1
00:31:22.909 --> 00:31:26.056
not be giving any solutions for
all those exercises.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7315-0
00:31:26.386 --> 00:31:28.076
Yeah, they're not a lot of
exercises.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7327-0
00:31:28.086 --> 00:31:30.369
Also, every slide will have just
two questions or three

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7327-1
00:31:30.369 --> 00:31:30.776
questions.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7342-0
00:31:31.186 --> 00:31:33.762
So officially I'll not release
any key because they are

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7342-1
00:31:33.762 --> 00:31:34.176
ungraded.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7366-0
00:31:34.566 --> 00:31:37.191
It is up to you to just discuss
here and you know, see if we're

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7366-1
00:31:37.191 --> 00:31:38.626
all on the right direction or
not.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7370-0
00:31:39.256 --> 00:31:39.416
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7375-0
00:31:40.556 --> 00:31:41.276
Is that clear, guys?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7379-0
00:31:41.286 --> 00:31:41.666
All of you?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7381-0
00:31:42.956 --> 00:31:43.266
Yes.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7385-0
00:31:43.276 --> 00:31:43.486
No.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7397-0
00:31:43.496 --> 00:31:46.856
Maybe you'll discuss inside our
sections discussion, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7425-0
00:31:46.866 --> 00:31:49.750
If you have any doubts also
we'll put here and so on and

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7425-1
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:52.836
either the TA or your own batch
MITS, or I will answer them.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7427-0
00:31:54.366 --> 00:31:54.616
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7436-0
00:31:54.626 --> 00:31:56.136
Is this clear canvas all of you?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7501-0
00:31:56.386 --> 00:31:59.779
And again, if you come back to

00:32:12.786 --> 00:32:13.996
Let's say we're learning about
stack.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7520-0
00:32:14.006 --> 00:32:16.916

00:32:24.976 --> 00:32:26.686
That is what I again and again
repeat.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7581-0
00:32:26.996 --> 00:32:30.353
You are live classes and

00:32:30.353 --> 00:32:30.726
Teams.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7599-0

those.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7651-0
00:32:45.136 --> 00:32:48.591
You will be able to have in your
canvas which is this portal that

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7651-1
00:32:48.591 --> 00:32:50.266
I'm currently you know, sharing.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7665-0

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7665-1
00:32:55.629 --> 00:32:55.876
yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7686-0
00:32:58.416 --> 00:33:01.152
They're open book and close book
exam paper will be designed by

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7686-1
00:33:01.152 --> 00:33:01.836
you only, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7698-0
00:33:01.846 --> 00:33:04.006
This means what we learn in the
class and slides.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7701-0
00:33:04.016 --> 00:33:04.746
Will there be enough?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7710-0
00:33:04.756 --> 00:33:05.666
No, it will not be enough.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7712-0
00:33:05.676 --> 00:33:06.026
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7725-0
00:33:06.136 --> 00:33:08.726
So I'm I'm very brutally honest
on these topics.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7727-0
00:33:09.096 --> 00:33:09.386
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7738-0
00:33:09.396 --> 00:33:11.316
So you're doing a masters
course.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7753-0
00:33:11.326 --> 00:33:16.832
Of course, from bits so badly
studying the slides will get you

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7753-1
00:33:16.832 --> 00:33:17.356
there.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7779-0
00:33:17.406 --> 00:33:20.399
I mean, maybe you will clear the
course that is the guarantee

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7779-1
00:33:20.399 --> 00:33:22.956
that you might get if you attend
all the 16 classes.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7787-0
00:33:23.176 --> 00:33:24.836
If you have, you know, studied
them.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7801-0
00:33:24.846 --> 00:33:27.596
If you have prepared the slides,
you will clear the codes.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7829-0
00:33:28.126 --> 00:33:31.266
But if you want to really
farewell and get a good hang of

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7829-1
00:33:31.266 --> 00:33:33.756
the course, you'll have to go
the extra mile.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7836-0
00:33:34.226 --> 00:33:35.716
You'll go through the, you know,
books.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7847-0
00:33:35.806 --> 00:33:38.568
You'll go through extra, you
know, tutorials, maybe the

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7847-1
00:33:38.568 --> 00:33:39.356
reference books.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7864-0
00:33:39.766 --> 00:33:42.173
You'll practice questions
online, right the moment you

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7864-1
00:33:42.173 --> 00:33:43.836
type about data structures
algorithm.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7874-0
00:33:43.846 --> 00:33:46.906
There are plenty of, you know,
things floating online.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7883-0
00:33:47.116 --> 00:33:49.646
You will go that extra mile.
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7891-0
00:33:49.656 --> 00:33:50.266
Is it clear, guys?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7893-0
00:33:50.276 --> 00:33:50.626
All of you?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7895-0
00:33:52.076 --> 00:33:52.386
Yes.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7897-0
00:33:52.396 --> 00:33:52.566
No.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7902-0
00:33:52.576 --> 00:33:52.736
Maybe.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7910-0
00:33:54.256 --> 00:33:56.146
And it's even an open book exam,
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7942-0
00:33:56.196 --> 00:33:58.948
So you have all the materials
and then if there is a question

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7942-1
00:33:58.948 --> 00:34:01.700
like you know what is this, what
is that then it doesn't make

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7942-2
00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:01.966
sense.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7958-0
00:34:01.976 --> 00:34:05.026
Yeah, we're not, you know,
kindergarten kids.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7961-0
00:34:05.036 --> 00:34:05.986
We're doing masters scores.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7963-0
00:34:07.026 --> 00:34:07.256
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7975-0
00:34:07.266 --> 00:34:08.866
Yeah, there's no pass percentage
is 1.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/7987-0
00:34:08.876 --> 00:34:11.036
Yeah, it it all depends on the
curve and so on.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8018-0
00:34:11.246 --> 00:34:14.817
So let's not get too much into
all that, but so far are you all

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8018-1
00:34:14.817 --> 00:34:17.996
clear with what is this course
about the course handout?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8042-0
00:34:18.126 --> 00:34:22.229
The textbooks for it and also
the canvas page are these things

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8042-1
00:34:22.229 --> 00:34:25.615
clear for all of you and the
assessment component 2

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8042-2
00:34:25.615 --> 00:34:26.396
assignments?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8051-0
00:34:26.406 --> 00:34:28.156
Both are mandatory 2 quizzes.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8063-0
00:34:29.096 --> 00:34:31.666
With this, you know best of the
two right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8075-0
00:34:31.856 --> 00:34:35.106
And finally, you also have your
mid semester and final exams.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8080-0
00:34:35.496 --> 00:34:36.586
Textbooks was not cleared.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8089-0
00:34:36.596 --> 00:34:38.326
Why is it not clear Santhosh?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8096-0
00:34:38.756 --> 00:34:40.126
It is also there in this slide.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8102-0
00:34:40.356 --> 00:34:41.356
This is your textbook.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8116-0
00:34:41.796 --> 00:34:44.056
This is the only textbook and
this is the reference book.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8118-0
00:34:44.836 --> 00:34:44.996
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8135-0
00:34:45.966 --> 00:34:48.296
So for no subjects, we will be
uploading the books.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8140-0
00:34:48.526 --> 00:34:49.556
The books is on you.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8156-0
00:34:49.606 --> 00:34:52.756
It is up to you to either buy a
physical copy or a digital copy.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8163-0
00:34:53.066 --> 00:34:53.856
Yeah, it is up to you.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8165-0
00:34:55.156 --> 00:34:55.386
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8171-0
00:34:55.396 --> 00:34:56.396
Is this clear all of you?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8184-0
00:34:59.916 --> 00:35:02.576
Well, if that is the case, then
let's get started, yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8200-0
00:35:05.406 --> 00:35:07.652
But firstly, what is the
motivation for, you know,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8200-1
00:35:07.652 --> 00:35:08.576
learning this course?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8202-0
00:35:08.626 --> 00:35:08.906
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8215-0
00:35:08.916 --> 00:35:10.896
So why should we even learn this
DSD course?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8254-0
00:35:11.986 --> 00:35:15.457
So most of you have you enrolled
for this program, aspiring to be

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8254-1
00:35:15.457 --> 00:35:18.822
a data scientist or in the LED
areas or are you already in this

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8254-2
00:35:18.822 --> 00:35:21.346
field and you know you want to
appeal yourself?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8269-0
00:35:21.356 --> 00:35:24.823
Is that the case or why is it
that you have enrolled for this

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8269-1
00:35:24.823 --> 00:35:25.326
Mtech DC?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8271-0
00:35:29.726 --> 00:35:29.906
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8286-0
00:35:32.406 --> 00:35:34.656
Guess how it it is a little
complex.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8295-0
00:35:34.666 --> 00:35:36.396
It is not just percentage and so
on.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8310-0
00:35:37.026 --> 00:35:40.700
We we, you know, get all the
scores out of 100 and do a you

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8310-1
00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:41.006
know.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8319-0
00:35:43.616 --> 00:35:44.636
Graph and then try to.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8323-0
00:35:44.646 --> 00:35:45.566
You know great people.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8331-0
00:35:45.736 --> 00:35:47.466
So yeah, it is called relative
grading.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8339-0
00:35:47.476 --> 00:35:48.926
You can read about it online.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8341-0
00:35:49.036 --> 00:35:49.166
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8348-0
00:35:50.806 --> 00:35:51.836
Yeah, to upskill yourself.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8364-0
00:35:51.846 --> 00:35:54.756
And so on, right in the in the
field of data science and so on.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8383-0
00:35:55.286 --> 00:35:58.265
There's good and even in such a
role, you would be definitely

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8383-1
00:35:58.265 --> 00:36:00.186
creating some solutions which
has code.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8385-0
00:36:00.896 --> 00:36:01.276
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8402-0
00:36:01.286 --> 00:36:03.606
So will you be able to do the
whole of data science, data

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8402-1
00:36:03.606 --> 00:36:04.446
science, engineering.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8410-0
00:36:05.236 --> 00:36:07.366
Uh, without writing any code?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8414-0
00:36:07.416 --> 00:36:08.016
Is that possible?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8443-0
00:36:09.246 --> 00:36:12.521
There's a lot of no code and all
that you know floating around,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8443-1
00:36:12.521 --> 00:36:15.898
but there is some amount of code
or problem solving that is still

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8443-2
00:36:15.898 --> 00:36:16.256
needed.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8447-0
00:36:17.146 --> 00:36:17.526
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8464-0
00:36:17.576 --> 00:36:21.359
So this whole you know, field
also has some amount of problem

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8464-1
00:36:21.359 --> 00:36:22.396
solving involved.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8499-0
00:36:23.216 --> 00:36:26.241
And when you want to code or
when you want to have some, you

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8499-1
00:36:26.241 --> 00:36:29.465
know systematic problem solving
in your mindset, you should have

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8499-2
00:36:29.465 --> 00:36:32.589
a very strong understanding of
data structures and algorithms,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8499-3
00:36:32.589 --> 00:36:32.886
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8528-0
00:36:34.166 --> 00:36:36.840
And didn't structures and
algorithms knowledge gives us

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8528-1
00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:39.657
the ability to improve our
solution to the problem and the

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8528-2
00:36:39.657 --> 00:36:41.996
ability to write much better and
efficient code?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8539-0
00:36:42.446 --> 00:36:43.836
Yeah, it will be able to help us
there.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8551-0
00:36:44.146 --> 00:36:47.603
And most importantly, it helps
to build problem solving

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8551-1
00:36:47.603 --> 00:36:48.096
mindset.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8575-0
00:36:48.566 --> 00:36:51.863
Yeah, this learning, data
structures and algorithms can be

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8575-1
00:36:51.863 --> 00:36:55.439
a major learning curve for any
computer science or data science

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8575-2
00:36:55.439 --> 00:36:55.886
student.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8597-0
00:36:55.896 --> 00:36:59.706
That is the whole point why we
are going to have this course in

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8597-1
00:36:59.706 --> 00:37:00.896
your next semesters.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8622-0
00:37:00.906 --> 00:37:03.835
You'll be learning a lot of
advanced courses like say, ML,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8622-1
00:37:03.835 --> 00:37:06.416
AI, deep learning, reinforcement
learning, whatnot.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8635-0
00:37:07.276 --> 00:37:11.518
In all that, inevitably, you are
learning some techniques and you

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8635-1
00:37:11.518 --> 00:37:12.546
know algorithms.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8639-0
00:37:12.556 --> 00:37:14.616
Do you agree to that? Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8642-0
00:37:17.946 --> 00:37:18.236
Yes.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8645-0
00:37:18.246 --> 00:37:18.516
No.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8650-0
00:37:19.106 --> 00:37:20.506
Inevitably, machine learning.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8654-0
00:37:20.516 --> 00:37:21.356
What is machine learning?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8656-0
00:37:21.366 --> 00:37:21.596
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8664-0
00:37:21.606 --> 00:37:23.116
So let's not talk jargons.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8669-0
00:37:23.126 --> 00:37:23.636
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8675-0
00:37:23.746 --> 00:37:25.116
In depth, what is machine
learning?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8687-0
00:37:25.126 --> 00:37:27.806
It is a couple of techniques
inside that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8692-0
00:37:27.816 --> 00:37:28.656
What is the technique?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8701-0
00:37:29.126 --> 00:37:31.776
Yeah, that technique is again
some algorithm, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8713-0
00:37:31.786 --> 00:37:33.096
Maybe you are doing some
clustering.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8737-0
00:37:33.366 --> 00:37:35.700
Your clustering a group of
people or you are, say

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8737-1
00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:38.686
classifying something, let's say
a fake news or, you know, real

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8737-2
00:37:38.686 --> 00:37:39.246
news, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8742-0
00:37:39.256 --> 00:37:39.896
You're doing all that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8756-0
00:37:39.906 --> 00:37:42.576
It is at the end of the day and
algorithm right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8770-0
00:37:42.666 --> 00:37:44.796
If it is an algorithm, then you
need to know this course.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8779-0
00:37:45.126 --> 00:37:46.726
You need to know how to write an
algorithm.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8804-0
00:37:46.736 --> 00:37:49.459
What are the different
strategies to write an algorithm

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8804-1
00:37:49.459 --> 00:37:51.987
and you know what are the
different data structures

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8804-2
00:37:51.987 --> 00:37:53.056
underlying them right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8817-0
00:37:53.066 --> 00:37:57.326
That is why it makes sense to
learn this course, yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8829-0
00:37:59.226 --> 00:38:01.636
So how many of you have done
this course formally?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8831-0
00:38:02.166 --> 00:38:02.496
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8845-0
00:38:02.506 --> 00:38:05.213
Can you just raise your hands
or, you know, put it in the

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8845-1
00:38:05.213 --> 00:38:05.446
chat?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8860-0
00:38:07.666 --> 00:38:09.716
When you gonna say yes plus one
and so on.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8874-0
00:38:11.086 --> 00:38:13.513
Most people have started ML
because they didn't want to

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8874-1
00:38:13.513 --> 00:38:13.946
become SD.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8877-0
00:38:13.946 --> 00:38:14.586
OK.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8886-0
00:38:14.826 --> 00:38:17.276
Yeah, it's also a good point.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8902-0
00:38:17.286 --> 00:38:20.505
A lot of you know, newbies have
a tough time learning this

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8902-1
00:38:20.505 --> 00:38:20.886
course.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8907-0
00:38:20.896 --> 00:38:22.946
Yeah, cool. I think.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8929-0
00:38:23.536 --> 00:38:25.681
A couple of you who have done
computer science engineering

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8929-1
00:38:25.681 --> 00:38:28.006
might have definitely, you know,
learned some concepts of this.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8938-0
00:38:28.016 --> 00:38:29.906
Yeah, might be long back, but
that's fine.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8950-0
00:38:29.966 --> 00:38:32.766
Yeah, as I told, we will start
from scratch.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8952-0
00:38:33.116 --> 00:38:33.256
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8989-0
00:38:34.666 --> 00:38:38.167
So what we will do now is maybe
for the next couple of minutes,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8989-1
00:38:38.167 --> 00:38:41.778
we will try to go about learning
very fundamentals and about what

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8989-2
00:38:41.778 --> 00:38:43.856
we are going to learn in this
course.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/8991-0
00:38:44.056 --> 00:38:44.236
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9000-0
00:38:44.246 --> 00:38:45.216
Then we will actually learn it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9003-0
00:38:46.026 --> 00:38:46.166
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9018-0
00:38:47.216 --> 00:38:49.890
Will the course language be
dependent or independent as

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9018-1
00:38:49.890 --> 00:38:50.606
implementing a?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9025-0
00:38:50.756 --> 00:38:51.986
Yeah, very important question.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9027-0
00:38:52.036 --> 00:38:52.306
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9034-0
00:38:52.316 --> 00:38:53.586
So I will answer that right
away.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9060-0
00:38:54.196 --> 00:38:58.531
So in this course, the whole
course in my classes I will not

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9060-1
00:38:58.531 --> 00:39:02.296
be teaching anything about
Python, Java or anything.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9074-0
00:39:02.806 --> 00:39:05.809
We will learn data structures
and algorithm design in a very

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9074-1
00:39:05.809 --> 00:39:06.596
general setting.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9086-0
00:39:06.986 --> 00:39:09.086
Yeah, we will write something
called as a pseudo code.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9094-0
00:39:09.136 --> 00:39:10.476
We will also learn about that
today.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9101-0
00:39:10.486 --> 00:39:11.356
We will learn about it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9135-0
00:39:11.666 --> 00:39:16.479
Don't worry, we will not write
any Python code in your quizzes

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9135-1
00:39:16.479 --> 00:39:21.444
in your mid semester exam and in
your final exam you will not be

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9135-2
00:39:21.444 --> 00:39:23.506
asked to write any program.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9145-0
00:39:23.936 --> 00:39:25.766
You will not be asked to write
Python program.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9160-0
00:39:25.826 --> 00:39:28.686
Will not be asked to write Java
program and so on, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9198-0
00:39:29.046 --> 00:39:32.930
The only two places where your
Python programming comes into

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9198-1
00:39:32.930 --> 00:39:36.940
picture is your assignment, then
lab right lab, meaning I will

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9198-2
00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:40.186
just upload those sheets just
for you to practice.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9218-0
00:39:40.396 --> 00:39:43.913
So you will have to be
proficient in Python to just run

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9218-1
00:39:43.913 --> 00:39:45.106
each cell you know.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9221-0
00:39:45.116 --> 00:39:45.866
Try to change it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9237-0
00:39:45.876 --> 00:39:48.506
Try to see you know how the
output is changing and so on.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9251-0
00:39:48.976 --> 00:39:52.067
And of course, both the
assignments you will be solving

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9251-1
00:39:52.067 --> 00:39:53.336
it using Python, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9291-0
00:39:53.346 --> 00:39:57.293
That is where Python comes in,
but apart from that, in my class

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9291-1
00:39:57.293 --> 00:40:00.870
as well as you know, in the
exams you are not expected to

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9291-2
00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:04.446
write any Python programs or any
program for that matter.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9312-0
00:40:04.456 --> 00:40:07.180
Yeah, if you write a program as
you know, a solution, it will

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9312-1
00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:08.146
just not be evaluated.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9326-0
00:40:08.666 --> 00:40:11.004
The question itself will very
clearly tell you what is

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9326-1
00:40:11.004 --> 00:40:11.386
expected.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9329-0
00:40:11.896 --> 00:40:12.046
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9336-0
00:40:13.526 --> 00:40:14.216
Is it clear, guys?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9338-0
00:40:14.226 --> 00:40:14.676
All of you?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9358-0
00:40:14.986 --> 00:40:19.116
Yeah, the Python programming
comes into picture only for your

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9358-1
00:40:19.116 --> 00:40:21.446
assignments, not for others.
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9361-0
00:40:24.976 --> 00:40:25.256
Cool.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9370-0
00:40:25.306 --> 00:40:26.336
So what is a program?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9374-0
00:40:26.816 --> 00:40:26.966
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9383-0
00:40:28.766 --> 00:40:30.136
And before that, what is an
algorithm?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9402-0
00:40:30.146 --> 00:40:32.765
Do you have any uh programs a
set of instructions given to

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9402-1
00:40:32.765 --> 00:40:34.096
machine for performing a task?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9406-0
00:40:34.106 --> 00:40:34.896
Yeah, very good.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9408-0
00:40:35.266 --> 00:40:35.496
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9416-0
00:40:35.506 --> 00:40:36.546
And what is an algorithm then?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9437-0
00:40:37.576 --> 00:40:40.726
An algorithm is a step by step
procedure for solving a problem

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9437-1
00:40:40.726 --> 00:40:42.076
in a finite amount of time.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9442-0
00:40:43.056 --> 00:40:43.646
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9454-0
00:40:43.936 --> 00:40:46.208
And then I suppose the
systematic way of organizing and

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9454-1
00:40:46.208 --> 00:40:46.816
accessing data.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9472-0
00:40:47.826 --> 00:40:51.546
So if you see this algorithm, it
talks about a step by step proof

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9472-1
00:40:51.546 --> 00:40:51.996
feature.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9477-0
00:40:52.916 --> 00:40:54.286
What solving a problem?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9488-0
00:40:54.296 --> 00:40:56.286
Yeah, it cannot solve all the
problems in the world.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9501-0
00:40:56.536 --> 00:41:00.733
Yeah, it cannot solve your
problems for one definite

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9501-1
00:41:00.733 --> 00:41:01.366
problem.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9527-0
00:41:01.456 --> 00:41:05.017
We are going to write a step by
step procedure to solve it and

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9527-1
00:41:05.017 --> 00:41:07.956
it is going to take a finite
amount of time, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9542-0
00:41:09.256 --> 00:41:11.677
And we have a lot of data
involved inside our programs,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9542-1
00:41:11.677 --> 00:41:11.936
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9553-0
00:41:11.946 --> 00:41:13.466
We have some variables you need
to store.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9564-0
00:41:13.476 --> 00:41:15.606
Some you know data and that is
where you are processing.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9572-0
00:41:15.976 --> 00:41:17.686
How do I store that effectively?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9576-0
00:41:18.216 --> 00:41:18.416
Right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9587-0
00:41:19.756 --> 00:41:22.166
You at this point in the data
sense world.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9592-0
00:41:22.176 --> 00:41:23.346
It is even more common, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9609-0
00:41:23.616 --> 00:41:26.486
You have tons of data and you'll
be doing a lot of work in that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9615-0
00:41:26.756 --> 00:41:27.586
How do you store it?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9651-0
00:41:28.116 --> 00:41:32.828
Should it store it in an array
or a linked list or a tree or a

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9651-1
00:41:32.828 --> 00:41:37.166
graph or a hash map or a B tree
or AVL tree or a KD tree?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9660-0
00:41:37.306 --> 00:41:38.946
There are a lot of data
structures.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9682-0
00:41:39.316 --> 00:41:42.599
Each of them have their own way
of storing things they own way

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9682-1
00:41:42.599 --> 00:41:44.266
of accessing, removal and so on.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9706-0
00:41:44.496 --> 00:41:48.700
So data structures is all about
how do you systematically store

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9706-1
00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:52.706
and organize data so that you
can use it efficiently, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9720-0
00:41:53.336 --> 00:41:56.128
So algorithms and data
structures put together makes up

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9720-1
00:41:56.128 --> 00:41:56.776
your program.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9722-0
00:41:57.706 --> 00:41:58.036
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9749-0
00:41:58.046 --> 00:42:01.865
So any program that you take if
you closely inspect it, you'll

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9749-1
00:42:01.865 --> 00:42:04.896
be able to see that it uses some
data structures.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9763-0
00:42:04.966 --> 00:42:09.905
It also follows a step by step
process to solve a problem

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9763-1
00:42:09.905 --> 00:42:10.416
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9788-0
00:42:10.626 --> 00:42:13.889
And algorithm is defined as a
finite sequence of unambiguous

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9788-1
00:42:13.889 --> 00:42:16.456
instructions follow to
accomplish a given task.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9809-0
00:42:16.566 --> 00:42:19.648
So whenever you come across
these definitions, more of a

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9809-1
00:42:19.648 --> 00:42:22.676
textbook way of definitions try
to break it down right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9815-0
00:42:22.906 --> 00:42:24.196
It is a finite sequence.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9820-0
00:42:24.206 --> 00:42:24.516
OK.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9825-0
00:42:24.566 --> 00:42:25.256
Well, and good it is.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9833-0
00:42:25.266 --> 00:42:26.376
Step One, Step 2, step three.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9835-0
00:42:26.386 --> 00:42:27.016
It is finite.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9840-0
00:42:27.516 --> 00:42:29.016
It is very unambiguous.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9849-0
00:42:29.096 --> 00:42:30.986
It should be very, very clear
instructions.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9857-0
00:42:31.266 --> 00:42:33.476
Yeah, it cannot be vague, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9869-0
00:42:33.486 --> 00:42:36.556
You know, perform this that is a
very vague statement.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9890-0
00:42:36.566 --> 00:42:40.036
Perform what right should be
very specific to accomplish a

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9890-1
00:42:40.036 --> 00:42:42.976
given task only that given task
it can do, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9926-0
00:42:44.936 --> 00:42:47.802
For example, if you see here
there's a algorithm and you give

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9926-1
00:42:47.802 --> 00:42:50.667
a specification of input that is
going to translate it into a

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9926-2
00:42:50.667 --> 00:42:51.776
specification of output.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9935-0
00:42:53.026 --> 00:42:55.696
Algorithm describes actions on
the input instance, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9952-0
00:42:55.706 --> 00:42:58.856
So it works on the input and it
is going to produce output.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9971-0
00:42:59.366 --> 00:43:03.191
And the beauty of algorithms is
that infinitely many correct

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9971-1
00:43:03.191 --> 00:43:05.636
algorithm for the same problem
exists.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9974-0
00:43:06.756 --> 00:43:06.916
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9984-0
00:43:07.936 --> 00:43:09.936
For example, if I ask you to do
sorting.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9994-0
00:43:10.706 --> 00:43:12.516
Yeah, and it may do it in one
way.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/9997-0
00:43:12.706 --> 00:43:12.976
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10007-0
00:43:12.986 --> 00:43:15.576
Whereas AAKASH may do it in
another way, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10009-0
00:43:16.936 --> 00:43:17.206
Yes.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10023-0
00:43:17.216 --> 00:43:21.116
No, all of you for sorting the
problem is the same.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10047-0
00:43:21.126 --> 00:43:23.538
I give you a list of numbers or
you know elements, whatever and

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10047-1
00:43:23.538 --> 00:43:25.686
you want to sort them in either
ascending or descending.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10057-0
00:43:27.036 --> 00:43:29.416
There are tons of algorithms and
all of them are correct.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10088-0
00:43:29.776 --> 00:43:32.922
You have bubble sort selection
sort, insertion sort, merge

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10088-1
00:43:32.922 --> 00:43:36.014
sort, quicksort, radix sort,
bucket, sort, counting sort,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10088-2
00:43:36.014 --> 00:43:37.026
whatnot, heap sort.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10102-0
00:43:37.456 --> 00:43:41.237
All of them are going to do
sorting only and all of them are

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10102-1
00:43:41.237 --> 00:43:42.166
correct, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10122-0
00:43:42.206 --> 00:43:45.884
Similar to that, for every
problem there are infinitely

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10122-1
00:43:45.884 --> 00:43:48.576
correct algorithms to do the
same thing.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10124-0
00:43:49.756 --> 00:43:50.266
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10150-0
00:43:50.336 --> 00:43:54.511
So even in your exams, if you
get a problem, there is not a,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10150-1
00:43:54.511 --> 00:43:56.906
you know single way to solve
that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10152-0
00:43:56.956 --> 00:43:57.166
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10157-0
00:43:57.176 --> 00:43:58.426
Nitish Mitglied in one way.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10169-0
00:43:58.476 --> 00:44:00.066
Yeah, Brenda will solute in
another way.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10174-0
00:44:00.336 --> 00:44:01.896
And both of them might work.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10182-0
00:44:02.096 --> 00:44:02.946
Yeah, I cannot tell that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10196-0
00:44:02.956 --> 00:44:06.013
You know, this is the only way
and that is the whole beauty of

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10196-1
00:44:06.013 --> 00:44:06.546
algorithms.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10223-0
00:44:06.996 --> 00:44:10.620
Yeah, an infinite number of
input instances satisfying the

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10223-1
00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:14.366
specification is also possible
for the same sorting example.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10249-0
00:44:14.596 --> 00:44:18.078
I can give one to five numbers
or I can give 10,000 numbers any

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10249-1
00:44:18.078 --> 00:44:21.016
you know type of numbers I'll be
able to give, right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10273-0
00:44:21.026 --> 00:44:24.848
Any combination of input as
possible, so infinitely correct

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10273-1
00:44:24.848 --> 00:44:27.586
number of inputs are also
possible, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10282-0
00:44:27.756 --> 00:44:29.166
With a very crude example,
right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10299-0
00:44:29.176 --> 00:44:32.875
For example, orange is your
input, you write an algorithm to

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10299-1
00:44:32.875 --> 00:44:34.026
make a juice right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10308-0
00:44:34.206 --> 00:44:36.606
You'll be able to just tell step
by step P lit.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10311-0
00:44:36.616 --> 00:44:37.366
Wash it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10327-0
00:44:37.676 --> 00:44:40.836
Add this much of sugar and whip
it for these many minutes.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10333-0
00:44:40.846 --> 00:44:41.286
And so on.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10336-0
00:44:41.536 --> 00:44:42.576
That forms your algorithm.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10347-0
00:44:43.886 --> 00:44:46.916
Yeah, but it would be efficient
to solve exactly.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10353-0
00:44:46.926 --> 00:44:47.536
We will come to that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10366-0
00:44:49.126 --> 00:44:51.098
There is where the whole you
know, of course, becomes

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10366-1
00:44:51.098 --> 00:44:51.536
interesting.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10376-0
00:44:51.866 --> 00:44:54.656
Then all of them are correctly
solving the problem.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10381-0
00:44:54.786 --> 00:44:56.436
Then who's better, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10401-0
00:44:56.446 --> 00:44:59.492
We will come there, but for now
is this clear, guys, all of you,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10401-1
00:44:59.492 --> 00:45:00.476
what is an algorithm?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10423-0
00:45:00.486 --> 00:45:04.930
What is the data structure and
what is you know an algorithm

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10423-1
00:45:04.930 --> 00:45:07.406
doing yes no, just early
morning.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10437-0
00:45:07.416 --> 00:45:09.106
Yeah, I don't see most of you
replying.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10443-0
00:45:09.276 --> 00:45:10.306
It only odd people.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10447-0
00:45:10.316 --> 00:45:10.436
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10449-0
00:45:12.206 --> 00:45:12.786
What's going on?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10459-0
00:45:14.946 --> 00:45:16.816
And what are some properties of
an algorithm?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10465-0
00:45:17.066 --> 00:45:18.516
Yeah, this is also important.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10467-0
00:45:18.526 --> 00:45:18.666
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10477-0
00:45:18.676 --> 00:45:20.076
What are the different
properties of it?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10480-0
00:45:21.006 --> 00:45:21.556
Input.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10488-0
00:45:21.646 --> 00:45:23.976
Each algorithm should have zero
or more inputs.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10490-0
00:45:23.986 --> 00:45:24.206
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10495-0
00:45:24.216 --> 00:45:25.046
Why is it 0?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10519-0
00:45:25.486 --> 00:45:28.397
Because some programs or
algorithms might implicitly

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10519-1
00:45:28.397 --> 00:45:31.692
assume some inputs, yeah, it
will already have input within

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10519-2
00:45:31.692 --> 00:45:31.856
it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10530-0
00:45:32.026 --> 00:45:34.256
It will not ask from the user,
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10542-0
00:45:34.266 --> 00:45:37.496
In those cases, it might not
have any explicit inputs.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10546-0
00:45:37.886 --> 00:45:38.196
Output.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10554-0
00:45:39.066 --> 00:45:41.076
The algorithm should produce
correct results.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10562-0
00:45:41.166 --> 00:45:44.196
At least one output has to be
produced, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10570-0
00:45:44.206 --> 00:45:45.736
We're not doing just for fun,
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10585-0
00:45:45.746 --> 00:45:49.068
Each algorithm is going to do
something, so at least one

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10585-1
00:45:49.068 --> 00:45:49.476
output.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10597-0
00:45:49.486 --> 00:45:51.797
It should definitely generate,
otherwise there's no point

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10597-1
00:45:51.797 --> 00:45:52.036
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10603-0
00:45:52.046 --> 00:45:52.996
Which is doing something.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10608-0
00:45:53.006 --> 00:45:54.196
It doesn't produce anything.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10617-0
00:45:54.446 --> 00:45:56.256
Then why are we even doing it
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10629-0
00:45:56.266 --> 00:45:58.880
It should definitely produce one
output at least, which should be

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10629-1
00:45:58.880 --> 00:45:59.196
correct.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10641-0
00:46:00.666 --> 00:46:03.836
Definitiveness each instruction
should be clear and unambiguous.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10648-0
00:46:03.846 --> 00:46:04.996
Very clear instructions.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10661-0
00:46:05.546 --> 00:46:07.794
The instructions should be
simple and should transform the

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10661-1
00:46:07.794 --> 00:46:08.936
given input to desired output.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10690-0
00:46:08.946 --> 00:46:12.392
It should be effective and it
should be finite, meaning the

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10690-1
00:46:12.392 --> 00:46:16.182
algorithm must terminate after a
finite sequence of instructions,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10690-2
00:46:16.182 --> 00:46:16.526
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10701-0
00:46:17.726 --> 00:46:19.756
Let's take this example of, you
know, making a tea.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10713-0
00:46:20.816 --> 00:46:22.106
So put that bag in a curve.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10724-0
00:46:22.116 --> 00:46:23.836
We'll the kettle with water,
boil the water in.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10767-0
00:46:23.846 --> 00:46:27.944
Kettle pour some you know, boil
milk, sugar and so on and you're

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10767-1
00:46:27.944 --> 00:46:31.537
able to 2:30 and in this
algorithm do you feel this is a

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10767-2
00:46:31.537 --> 00:46:35.066
very good algorithm or is there
any problems with this?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10770-0
00:46:37.176 --> 00:46:37.336
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10778-0
00:46:38.626 --> 00:46:40.636
Yes, think about those
attributes that we learned.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10787-0
00:46:43.376 --> 00:46:45.036
AAKASH Reserve, Zimbra and
others.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10799-0
00:46:45.576 --> 00:46:49.386
Is this an effective algorithm
or does it have some problems?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10807-0
00:46:50.666 --> 00:46:52.196
Yeah, very good amount of water.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10811-0
00:46:52.206 --> 00:46:52.916
It is not given.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10816-0
00:46:52.926 --> 00:46:53.596
Yeah, sugar.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10819-0
00:46:53.946 --> 00:46:54.556
I don't know.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10829-0
00:46:54.566 --> 00:46:56.576
I mean should I put 1KG or 1
gram?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10833-0
00:46:56.586 --> 00:46:57.386
I don't know.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10837-0
00:46:57.526 --> 00:46:58.256
Yeah, add milk.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10845-0
00:46:58.266 --> 00:46:59.426
How much to add right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10847-0
00:46:59.626 --> 00:47:00.656
Some water, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10851-0
00:47:00.666 --> 00:47:01.316
What is some?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10869-0
00:47:01.406 --> 00:47:05.426
Yeah, we did some ML or liters
or that is not given right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10875-0
00:47:05.506 --> 00:47:06.996
This is definitely an algorithm.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10891-0
00:47:07.006 --> 00:47:09.649
It is step by step process to
make tea, but it is not very

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10891-1
00:47:09.649 --> 00:47:10.096
effective.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10909-0
00:47:10.326 --> 00:47:12.985
It is lacking a lot of steps
like you know it is not

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10909-1
00:47:12.985 --> 00:47:13.536
definitive.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10912-0
00:47:13.546 --> 00:47:14.506
It is not effective.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10926-0
00:47:14.666 --> 00:47:17.746
It is having ambiguous
instructions and so on, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10938-0
00:47:18.726 --> 00:47:22.006
Will you be writing these type
of algorithms here?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10949-0
00:47:23.006 --> 00:47:25.456
You should not be writing these
type of algorithms.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10969-0
00:47:25.466 --> 00:47:28.199
Yeah, it should be very, very
clear and very, you know,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10969-1
00:47:28.199 --> 00:47:29.906
precise, unambiguous
instructions.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10984-0
00:47:31.316 --> 00:47:34.784
And also if you observe here
some steps like 5 and six can be

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/10984-1
00:47:34.784 --> 00:47:35.846
interchanged right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11016-0
00:47:35.936 --> 00:47:38.860
So for example, some people
might prefer to add sugar 1st

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11016-1
00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:41.784
and then milk on it, or some
people might do milk 1st and

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11016-2
00:47:41.784 --> 00:47:43.246
sugared and both are correct.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11035-0
00:47:43.616 --> 00:47:47.104
Some steps of an algorithm can
be interchanged, but some steps

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11035-1
00:47:47.104 --> 00:47:49.926
like three and eight cannot be
interchanged right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11042-0
00:47:49.936 --> 00:47:51.446
Three is boiling and eight is
drinking.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11049-0
00:47:51.456 --> 00:47:52.886
You cannot drink before boiling
it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11052-0
00:47:53.966 --> 00:47:54.236
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11057-0
00:47:54.246 --> 00:47:55.076
Is this clear guys?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11067-0
00:47:55.256 --> 00:47:56.516
So what is this crux?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11080-0
00:47:57.086 --> 00:48:00.653
Whenever we write algorithms, it
may not be exactly the same for

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11080-1
00:48:00.653 --> 00:48:01.256
two people.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11094-0
00:48:01.346 --> 00:48:04.315
Yeah, there are some small nitty
gritties which can be

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11094-1
00:48:04.315 --> 00:48:05.016
interchanged.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11107-0
00:48:05.026 --> 00:48:08.183
It doesn't matter, but some
major aspects cannot be

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11107-1
00:48:08.183 --> 00:48:09.336
interchanged, yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11115-0
00:48:11.006 --> 00:48:12.716
Because of program development.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11133-0
00:48:13.006 --> 00:48:15.710
So this is program development,
not your, you know, software

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11133-1
00:48:15.710 --> 00:48:18.236
development software development
of course is different.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11138-0
00:48:18.246 --> 00:48:19.736
It is called SDLC, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11146-0
00:48:20.026 --> 00:48:21.516
You go about gathering
requirement.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11162-0
00:48:21.526 --> 00:48:24.393
You design it, you develop it,
you test it, and all those, you

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11162-1
00:48:24.393 --> 00:48:25.576
know, things are possible.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11174-0
00:48:25.986 --> 00:48:29.406
Yeah, but here we are talking
about program development.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11187-0
00:48:29.926 --> 00:48:32.716
If a problem is given to you,
how do you go about solving it?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11196-0
00:48:33.326 --> 00:48:35.186
Yeah, firstly understand the
problem.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11206-0
00:48:36.326 --> 00:48:40.116
Ascertain the capabilities of
computational device right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11224-0
00:48:40.126 --> 00:48:42.601
For example, at the end of the
day, where is your solution

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11224-1
00:48:42.601 --> 00:48:43.146
going to run?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11233-0
00:48:43.896 --> 00:48:45.446
Is it going to run on a
computer?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11243-0
00:48:45.516 --> 00:48:47.826
Is it going to run on a washing
machine?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11252-0
00:48:47.836 --> 00:48:49.446
Is it going to run on a rocket?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11261-0
00:48:49.576 --> 00:48:51.086
Is it going to run in a watch?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11266-0
00:48:51.216 --> 00:48:52.166
We don't know, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11279-0
00:48:52.276 --> 00:48:54.206
So we should ascertain those
capabilities.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11289-0
00:48:54.216 --> 00:48:55.746
Where is it that it is going to
run?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11301-0
00:48:56.156 --> 00:48:58.836
You will also try to determine
what data structure to use.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11380-0
00:48:58.846 --> 00:49:02.440
What algorithm to use and so on
and then you will design the

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11380-1
00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:06.033
algorithm and then you will
prove the algorithms correctness

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11380-2
00:49:06.033 --> 00:49:09.390
that you know what this
algorithm works for this problem

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11380-3
00:49:09.390 --> 00:49:12.925
whatever I have designed, this
algorithm is going to do the

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11380-4
00:49:12.925 --> 00:49:16.695
right thing and then analyze the
algorithm and tell about is it

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11380-5
00:49:16.695 --> 00:49:19.934
good or bad or how is it
performing and then implement

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11380-6
00:49:19.934 --> 00:49:23.056
the algorithm in any language of
your choice. Right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11399-0
00:49:23.326 --> 00:49:25.913
So in this course we are not
going to talk about the first

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11399-1
00:49:25.913 --> 00:49:26.176
block.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11413-0
00:49:26.636 --> 00:49:28.806
Understanding your problem, you
all are already professionals.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11423-0
00:49:28.816 --> 00:49:30.396
You might be doing this in your
office.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11443-0
00:49:30.406 --> 00:49:32.681
You know day-to-day when a
problem is given, you will be

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11443-1
00:49:32.681 --> 00:49:34.556
able to understand what the
problem is, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11457-0
00:49:35.536 --> 00:49:38.266
And the second part this we will
learn in this course.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11478-0
00:49:39.236 --> 00:49:41.798
The third thing which is
designing an algorithm we will

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11478-1
00:49:41.798 --> 00:49:44.496
learn in this course, proving
the algorithm's correctness.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11487-0
00:49:44.506 --> 00:49:46.006
You can do it in a lot of ways.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11493-0
00:49:46.286 --> 00:49:47.966
You can use mathematical
induction.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11516-0
00:49:48.056 --> 00:49:51.732
You can, you know, he was
mathematical techniques or you

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11516-1
00:49:51.732 --> 00:49:54.376
can use some, you know test
cases right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11561-0
00:49:54.386 --> 00:49:58.142
You can take, you know, a couple
of test cases, edge cases and so

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11561-1
00:49:58.142 --> 00:50:01.784
on and try to tell that for all
these inputs my algorithm works

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11561-2
00:50:01.784 --> 00:50:05.313
right and analysis of algorithm
we will again look at this in

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11561-3
00:50:05.313 --> 00:50:07.816
this course and implementing the
algorithm.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11567-0
00:50:07.886 --> 00:50:09.236
We will not do it in the class.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11580-0
00:50:09.466 --> 00:50:11.936
This is what you will do in your
assignment, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11599-0
00:50:11.946 --> 00:50:15.099
You will first design all this
and you will also try to come up

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11599-1
00:50:15.099 --> 00:50:16.626
with a Python program for that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11609-0
00:50:18.696 --> 00:50:20.046
Yes, no hall of you clear with
this.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11619-0
00:50:21.386 --> 00:50:23.676
Put the last box is not even
important.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11636-0
00:50:23.806 --> 00:50:27.491
Yeah, of course it is important,
but not as important as the

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11636-1
00:50:27.491 --> 00:50:28.276
other blocks.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11650-0
00:50:28.666 --> 00:50:32.245
If you have created all this,
the last can be done by any

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11650-1
00:50:32.245 --> 00:50:32.676
newbie.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11691-0
00:50:32.686 --> 00:50:35.471
Also, they can keep looking at
the syntax in the Internet and

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11691-1
00:50:35.471 --> 00:50:38.255
they can do that, but a lot of
newbies believe if they know a

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11691-2
00:50:38.255 --> 00:50:40.276
lot of programming languages,
they're smart.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11694-0
00:50:41.066 --> 00:50:41.736
Not at all.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11703-0
00:50:41.826 --> 00:50:44.076
Yeah, that is just the last
step.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11733-0
00:50:44.086 --> 00:50:47.341
It is just translating a
solution into code which you can

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11733-1
00:50:47.341 --> 00:50:50.821
do it in Java, Python, swift,
whatever you like and that will

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11733-2
00:50:50.821 --> 00:50:51.606
keep changing.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11755-0
00:50:52.476 --> 00:50:56.748
But this aspect of understanding
a problem, determining how to

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11755-1
00:50:56.748 --> 00:51:00.206
design what to design, designing
it, analyzing it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11766-0
00:51:00.316 --> 00:51:03.986
This is what is problem solving
techniques which is important.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11779-0
00:51:04.486 --> 00:51:06.566
Yeah, that is also one of the
learning objectives of this

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11779-1
00:51:06.566 --> 00:51:06.816
course.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11781-0
00:51:08.136 --> 00:51:08.276
Cool.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11799-0
00:51:09.216 --> 00:51:12.072
So now let's have a quick
outlook of what we are going to

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11799-1
00:51:12.072 --> 00:51:13.106
learn in this course.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11803-0
00:51:13.256 --> 00:51:14.946
Yeah, I'll.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11808-0
00:51:14.956 --> 00:51:15.866
I'll quickly run away.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11811-0
00:51:15.876 --> 00:51:16.226
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11822-0
00:51:16.236 --> 00:51:18.336
So don't you know, bother too
much about it?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11840-0
00:51:18.346 --> 00:51:21.711
Because I'm just giving you an
outlook of what all are there in

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11840-1
00:51:21.711 --> 00:51:22.446
store for you?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11848-0
00:51:22.506 --> 00:51:24.146
Yeah, we're not actually going
detailed today.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11884-0
00:51:24.826 --> 00:51:28.265
Yeah, we learned something
called as data structures for

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11884-1
00:51:28.265 --> 00:51:32.066
the first half of the semester,
meaning till your mid semester

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11884-2
00:51:32.066 --> 00:51:35.746
exam, we are not even going to
learn about algorithm design.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11888-0
00:51:36.546 --> 00:51:36.736
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11903-0
00:51:36.746 --> 00:51:40.269
If you remember our course name,
it is called data structures and

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11903-1
00:51:40.269 --> 00:51:41.176
algorithm design.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11911-0
00:51:41.246 --> 00:51:42.416
Yeah, there are two parts in it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11921-0
00:51:42.726 --> 00:51:44.926
One is data structures, one is
algorithm design.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11956-0
00:51:46.176 --> 00:51:48.945
So data structures is what we
will look at in the first half

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11956-1
00:51:48.945 --> 00:51:51.713
of the semester and algorithm
design is what we will look at

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11956-2
00:51:51.713 --> 00:51:53.346
in the second half of the
semester.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11963-0
00:51:53.596 --> 00:51:54.926
But they're all very related.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11980-0
00:51:55.216 --> 00:51:57.680
Yeah, you cannot write an
algorithm without a data

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11980-1
00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:58.646
structure and so on.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11986-0
00:51:58.736 --> 00:51:58.856
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11995-0
00:52:00.216 --> 00:52:02.577
In data structures,
particularly, we will learn

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/11995-1
00:52:02.577 --> 00:52:03.216
about arrays.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12003-0
00:52:03.286 --> 00:52:04.986
We will learn about linked list.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12015-0
00:52:05.306 --> 00:52:07.116
We will learn something called
as a stack.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12022-0
00:52:07.206 --> 00:52:08.966
We will learn something called
as a queue.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12028-0
00:52:09.406 --> 00:52:10.756
We will learn hash tables.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12035-0
00:52:11.076 --> 00:52:12.156
We will learn about trees.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12055-0
00:52:12.226 --> 00:52:15.228
Yeah, it is called a
hierarchical data structure and

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12055-1
00:52:15.228 --> 00:52:17.436
we will learn a lot of types of
trees.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12062-0
00:52:17.446 --> 00:52:18.676
We will learn about heaps.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12078-0
00:52:19.216 --> 00:52:22.316
We will learn about AVL trees,
graphs and all that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12107-0
00:52:22.326 --> 00:52:26.073
We will learn and we will take a
pause in the eighth session and

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12107-1
00:52:26.073 --> 00:52:29.762
after the mid semester exam we
will start with something called

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12107-2
00:52:29.762 --> 00:52:31.376
less algorithmic techniques.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12109-0
00:52:32.456 --> 00:52:33.006
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12138-0
00:52:33.156 --> 00:52:35.862
So for example, if you have a
lock like this which is having 3

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12138-1
00:52:35.862 --> 00:52:38.611
digits and say I have forgotten
the password, will I be able to

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12138-2
00:52:38.611 --> 00:52:39.126
unlock this?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12149-0
00:52:41.236 --> 00:52:42.846
No, no, that is what I was
telling others.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12155-0
00:52:42.856 --> 00:52:43.966
Yeah, they are all related.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12177-0
00:52:44.056 --> 00:52:47.185
You will still have algorithms,
but based on these concepts

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12177-1
00:52:47.185 --> 00:52:49.426
there might be an algorithm
asked on tree.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12190-0
00:52:49.596 --> 00:52:52.095
There might be, you know,
algorithm based on heap and so

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12190-1
00:52:52.095 --> 00:52:52.226
on.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12194-0
00:52:52.556 --> 00:52:52.746
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12228-0
00:52:52.756 --> 00:52:55.999
We will not actually look at the
algorithmic techniques per say

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12228-1
00:52:55.999 --> 00:52:59.343
that we will do it after the mid
semester, but we will learn some

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12228-2
00:52:59.343 --> 00:53:01.166
algorithms even before the
midterm.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12236-0
00:53:01.176 --> 00:53:04.626
Also today all combinations from
you know. Start.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12243-0
00:53:04.636 --> 00:53:06.766
Yeah, that's a smart answer,
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12290-0
00:53:07.376 --> 00:53:10.923
So what we will do if I have all
the time in the world, I will

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12290-1
00:53:10.923 --> 00:53:14.357
start from 000001002 up to 999
and one of them should be the

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12290-2
00:53:14.357 --> 00:53:16.946
password and definitely it will
get unlocked.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12313-0
00:53:17.396 --> 00:53:22.969
So in this did I use my mind or
did I just use my time to just

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12313-1
00:53:22.969 --> 00:53:24.826
try everything? Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12321-0
00:53:26.546 --> 00:53:27.916
Should I put in any of my?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12328-0
00:53:27.926 --> 00:53:28.856
You know mine to use.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12338-0
00:53:28.866 --> 00:53:30.816
No, I had all the time in the
world.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12360-0
00:53:30.866 --> 00:53:33.953
I just started trying every
possible combination and

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12360-1
00:53:33.953 --> 00:53:37.448
whatever works works this type
of problem solving is called

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12360-2
00:53:37.448 --> 00:53:38.146
brute force.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12406-0
00:53:38.716 --> 00:53:41.728
Yeah, this is called brute
force, meaning brute force

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12406-1
00:53:41.728 --> 00:53:45.073
algorithms are exactly what they
sound like straightforward

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12406-2
00:53:45.073 --> 00:53:48.308
method for solving a problem
that rely on sheer computing

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12406-3
00:53:48.308 --> 00:53:51.430
power and trying every
possibility rather than advanced

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12406-4
00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:53.326
techniques to improve
efficiency.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12420-0
00:53:54.396 --> 00:53:56.873
Right, it is not efficient
because you're randomly trying

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12420-1
00:53:56.873 --> 00:53:58.026
every possible combination.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12428-0
00:53:58.356 --> 00:53:59.236
Yeah, you have the time.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12431-0
00:53:59.246 --> 00:53:59.636
You can do it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12441-0
00:54:00.446 --> 00:54:02.796
Yeah, but it has its own
problems.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12452-0
00:54:02.806 --> 00:54:04.356
You will look at it later in
this course.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12463-0
00:54:04.606 --> 00:54:07.226
So you will have to learn about
advanced techniques.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12465-0
00:54:07.636 --> 00:54:08.136
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12499-0
00:54:08.186 --> 00:54:11.130
So those techniques we will
learn in this course after the

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12499-1
00:54:11.130 --> 00:54:14.274
mid semester, right, so that is
what are these techniques like

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12499-2
00:54:14.274 --> 00:54:17.317
greedy technique divide and
conquer, dynamic programming and

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12499-3
00:54:17.317 --> 00:54:17.616
so on.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12507-0
00:54:17.826 --> 00:54:19.496
So these are not algorithms.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12514-0
00:54:19.926 --> 00:54:22.256
These are algorithms, strategies
or.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12517-0
00:54:22.266 --> 00:54:23.736
These are algorithm techniques.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12531-0
00:54:24.366 --> 00:54:26.263
There are thousands of
algorithms under greedy

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12531-1
00:54:26.263 --> 00:54:26.666
technique.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12541-0
00:54:27.426 --> 00:54:29.751
There are again thousands of
algorithms under a divide and

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12541-1
00:54:29.751 --> 00:54:30.066
conquer.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12553-0
00:54:30.766 --> 00:54:32.756
You get it right, it it is a
school of thought.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12562-0
00:54:32.826 --> 00:54:34.476
It is more of a ideology.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12564-0
00:54:34.636 --> 00:54:35.116
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12573-0
00:54:35.186 --> 00:54:37.616
So divide and conquer is an
ideology. It says.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12581-0
00:54:37.626 --> 00:54:39.836
Always divide the problem into
smaller bits.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12594-0
00:54:40.186 --> 00:54:42.326
Try to solve each smaller
individual bit.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12604-0
00:54:42.626 --> 00:54:45.426
It simply means you have solved
the bigger problem right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12610-0
00:54:45.436 --> 00:54:46.486
So it is an ideology.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12620-0
00:54:46.496 --> 00:54:48.246
It is not an algorithm by
itself.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12632-0
00:54:48.656 --> 00:54:51.946
There are plenty of algorithms
which follow this ideology.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12642-0
00:54:52.396 --> 00:54:54.886
Similarly, greedy technique,
dynamic programming and so on.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12671-0
00:54:55.096 --> 00:54:58.076
There are many more techniques
also like branch and bound

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12671-1
00:54:58.076 --> 00:55:00.902
randomization, genetic
algorithms and so on, but those

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12671-2
00:55:00.902 --> 00:55:02.546
are not in scope of this course.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12728-0
00:55:02.976 --> 00:55:05.843
You will only be majorly
focusing on these three

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12728-1
00:55:05.843 --> 00:55:09.529
techniques and we will take a
couple of examples of algorithms

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12728-2
00:55:09.529 --> 00:55:13.274
which fall under this strategy
and we will learn about all that

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12728-3
00:55:13.274 --> 00:55:16.784
after the mindset and in the
last two classes, we will also

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12728-4
00:55:16.784 --> 00:55:19.826
learn about something called as
complexity classes.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12745-0
00:55:20.406 --> 00:55:24.126
Yeah, there are a lot of
problems even today which cannot

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12745-1
00:55:24.126 --> 00:55:25.536
be solved efficiently.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12752-0
00:55:26.026 --> 00:55:26.356
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12771-0
00:55:26.366 --> 00:55:29.331
We will try to ask about will
there be a time when you know we

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12771-1
00:55:29.331 --> 00:55:31.496
will be able to solve everything
efficiently?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12777-0
00:55:32.346 --> 00:55:33.506
Is that even possible?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12792-0
00:55:33.966 --> 00:55:37.376
If you encounter a problem which
is not solvable efficiently,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12792-1
00:55:37.376 --> 00:55:38.476
then what do you do?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12794-0
00:55:38.886 --> 00:55:39.116
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12829-0
00:55:39.126 --> 00:55:42.275
Should we just leave it or you
know if a client comes up with

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12829-1
00:55:42.275 --> 00:55:45.424
the problem, which is a, you
know, very difficult problem, it

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12829-2
00:55:45.424 --> 00:55:46.896
cannot be solved effectively.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12838-0
00:55:47.106 --> 00:55:48.376
Then what is that you're going
to do?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12847-0
00:55:49.316 --> 00:55:50.306
Maybe you have to make money.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12857-0
00:55:50.316 --> 00:55:51.916
You're going to, you know, sell
the product to them.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12868-0
00:55:51.926 --> 00:55:52.846
You are going to make a deal.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12877-0
00:55:53.016 --> 00:55:55.506
So how do you go about working
your way around?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12895-0
00:55:55.786 --> 00:55:59.596
What are the other ways for
these type of you know problems

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12895-1
00:55:59.596 --> 00:55:59.976
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12908-0
00:56:00.156 --> 00:56:02.286
We will try to learn about all
that in the last two classes.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12910-0
00:56:03.766 --> 00:56:03.996
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12916-0
00:56:04.006 --> 00:56:04.496
Is this clear?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12918-0
00:56:04.506 --> 00:56:05.036
Guys, all of you?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12925-0
00:56:07.196 --> 00:56:08.226
Yeah. Travelling salesman.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12938-0
00:56:08.236 --> 00:56:10.710
Not not just that there are
hundreds of problems like that,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12938-1
00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:10.916
yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12941-0
00:56:14.126 --> 00:56:14.416
Yes.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12945-0
00:56:14.426 --> 00:56:14.596
No.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12948-0
00:56:14.606 --> 00:56:15.396
Maybe all of you.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12973-0
00:56:15.886 --> 00:56:18.779
So first two classes we are
going to just learn about

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12973-1
00:56:18.779 --> 00:56:21.136
algorithm analyzing an algorithm
and so on.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/12986-0
00:56:21.626 --> 00:56:24.176
And then we will look at data
structures, data structures.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13013-0
00:56:24.186 --> 00:56:27.545
We will look to say for a good
6-7 classes we will look at it

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13013-1
00:56:27.545 --> 00:56:30.416
and then again we will start
algorithms, strategies.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13056-0
00:56:30.426 --> 00:56:33.347
We will learn all that and
finally we will close this

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13056-1
00:56:33.347 --> 00:56:36.268
course with what are those
algorithms which are still

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13056-2
00:56:36.268 --> 00:56:39.404
challenging mankind and will
there ever be a time when we

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13056-3
00:56:39.404 --> 00:56:41.946
will be able to solve them
effectively, right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13072-0
00:56:41.986 --> 00:56:45.589
So all such discussions we will
do, then we will close the

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13072-1
00:56:45.589 --> 00:56:46.016
course.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13075-0
00:56:46.446 --> 00:56:46.926
Is this clear?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13096-0
00:56:48.006 --> 00:56:51.681
Because always you should have a
big picture of what is it that

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13096-1
00:56:51.681 --> 00:56:53.116
I'm doing in this course?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13104-0
00:56:53.126 --> 00:56:54.616
Yeah, later you can actually
learn it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13122-0
00:56:54.966 --> 00:56:57.928
Yeah, but at least you should
have a fair idea about how the

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13122-1
00:56:57.928 --> 00:56:58.996
course is progressing.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13128-0
00:56:59.006 --> 00:57:00.256
Where do we release stand?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13143-0
00:57:00.366 --> 00:57:04.521
Yeah, these are all important
questions that you need to know,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13143-1
00:57:04.521 --> 00:57:04.916
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13147-0
00:57:05.406 --> 00:57:06.296
A quick progress check.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13156-0
00:57:06.306 --> 00:57:07.556
This is what we have done right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13179-0
00:57:07.926 --> 00:57:11.531
We have taken some introduction
motivation about handout and all

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13179-1
00:57:11.531 --> 00:57:14.582
that and we also looked at some
basics of notion of an

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13179-2
00:57:14.582 --> 00:57:15.136
algorithm.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13184-0
00:57:15.146 --> 00:57:16.056
Which properties?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13191-0
00:57:16.326 --> 00:57:17.816
And so on, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13195-0
00:57:19.296 --> 00:57:19.786
Is that clear?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13197-0
00:57:19.796 --> 00:57:20.426
Days. Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13219-0
00:57:24.526 --> 00:57:26.755
We'll we'll have a look at a
couple of more slides and then

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13219-1
00:57:26.755 --> 00:57:27.906
we'll take a quick break, yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13229-0
00:57:29.856 --> 00:57:31.456
This is question who's the
champion?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13231-0
00:57:32.456 --> 00:57:32.616
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13234-0
00:57:34.106 --> 00:57:34.286
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13239-0
00:57:35.146 --> 00:57:35.896
What is the meaning of?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13243-0
00:57:35.906 --> 00:57:36.036
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13252-0
00:57:36.046 --> 00:57:37.616
We will come back to that when
we come there.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13267-0
00:57:37.626 --> 00:57:40.505
Yeah, it is called polynomial,
nondeterministic polynomial and

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13267-1
00:57:40.505 --> 00:57:40.916
all that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13282-0
00:57:41.276 --> 00:57:45.161
But any algorithm which can be
solved effectively is called P

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13282-1
00:57:45.161 --> 00:57:45.536
class.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13285-0
00:57:45.586 --> 00:57:46.776
Yeah, polynomial class.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13289-0
00:57:47.046 --> 00:57:47.826
Don't worry about that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13294-0
00:57:47.836 --> 00:57:48.296
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13304-0
00:57:48.346 --> 00:57:50.776
We will learn about it in detail
when the time comes.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13309-0
00:57:52.616 --> 00:57:53.406
Who's the champion?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13317-0
00:57:53.556 --> 00:57:54.376
There's Sachin.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13325-0
00:57:54.386 --> 00:57:57.906
There's Doni, there is Virat,
there's Zahir. Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13342-0
00:58:00.706 --> 00:58:05.136
Yeah, you have just come out of
the World Cup drama, I believe.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13346-0
00:58:05.686 --> 00:58:06.576
But yeah, go ahead.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13357-0
00:58:06.906 --> 00:58:09.476
Who's the champion among these
four? Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13363-0
00:58:15.726 --> 00:58:16.616
Yes, real quick.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13375-0
00:58:17.186 --> 00:58:19.196
Tell them are diplomatic, like
all of them.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13397-0
00:58:19.206 --> 00:58:24.125
Some of them don't need wrath
and so on, but if I were you, I

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13397-1
00:58:24.125 --> 00:58:27.536
will ask the next question on
what metric?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13420-0
00:58:28.006 --> 00:58:32.010
Yeah, you are showing, you know,
champion on what terms when it's

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13420-1
00:58:32.010 --> 00:58:33.526
the total number of runs.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13437-0
00:58:34.026 --> 00:58:36.903
You know, Sachin, maybe if it's
the number of cups, then it is

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13437-1
00:58:36.903 --> 00:58:37.176
Dhoni.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13449-0
00:58:37.186 --> 00:58:39.606
If it's wickets, then undeniable
it, Zahir and so on.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13465-0
00:58:40.186 --> 00:58:44.786
So then in this question,
correct, who's the champion?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13480-0
00:58:45.256 --> 00:58:47.467
When I ask that question, you
suddenly started replaying the

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13480-1
00:58:47.467 --> 00:58:48.336
only Virat and all that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13501-0
00:58:49.286 --> 00:58:54.325
The thing is, we should ask on
what criteria on what metric, on

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13501-1
00:58:54.325 --> 00:58:57.316
what terms should I answer you
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13508-0
00:58:57.526 --> 00:58:58.886
That should have been your next
question.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13516-0
00:59:00.226 --> 00:59:00.796
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13529-0
00:59:00.926 --> 00:59:06.633
Similarly, in algorithms, when
there are two correct solutions

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13529-1
00:59:06.633 --> 00:59:07.176
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13562-0
00:59:07.186 --> 00:59:10.389
For example, here I want to know
since you know, let's believe

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13562-1
00:59:10.389 --> 00:59:13.643
the whole course is over and I
want to know who's the Topper in

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13562-2
00:59:13.643 --> 00:59:14.456
the DSDT course.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13574-0
00:59:14.966 --> 00:59:17.606
And I hope you know the Topper
is maybe 100.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13579-0
00:59:19.036 --> 00:59:19.566
Let's see.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13586-0
00:59:19.856 --> 00:59:21.496
I've given the problem to two
students.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13588-0
00:59:21.506 --> 00:59:21.886
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13603-0
00:59:21.896 --> 00:59:25.826
So one is, say, Amit and another
I have given it to say you know.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13608-0
00:59:28.096 --> 00:59:28.726
Vertica.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13629-0
00:59:28.876 --> 00:59:32.086
Yeah, how they have solved this
is vertika is, you know, quickly

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13629-1
00:59:32.086 --> 00:59:33.666
sorted them in descending order.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13653-0
00:59:33.796 --> 00:59:36.942
Yeah, once you sorted in
descending order, the toppers

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13653-1
00:59:36.942 --> 00:59:38.486
mark will be the first one.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13675-0
00:59:38.716 --> 00:59:41.578
So we can just take it as a one
when you write it in algorithms,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13675-1
00:59:41.578 --> 00:59:42.766
you can write it like this.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13684-0
00:59:42.926 --> 00:59:45.526
Actually this is a zero that is
also fine.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13694-0
00:59:46.016 --> 00:59:48.076
This is fine or the other way.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13708-0
00:59:49.176 --> 00:59:52.106
The other way, Amit, how he has
done it is he has taken a loop.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13720-0
00:59:52.116 --> 00:59:53.586
He has, you know, compared all
of them.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13723-0
00:59:53.596 --> 00:59:54.646
He kept on checking.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13734-0
00:59:54.656 --> 00:59:57.516
Who's the largest Marks and the
largest mark?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13737-0
00:59:57.526 --> 00:59:57.866
Yes.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13739-0
00:59:58.016 --> 00:59:58.606
Found out.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13743-0
00:59:59.096 --> 00:59:59.776
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13748-0
00:59:59.836 --> 01:00:01.826
Are both of these algorithms
correct?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13762-0
01:00:02.056 --> 01:00:06.657
Will both of them give me the
toppest mark in this course?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13762-1
01:00:06.657 --> 01:00:07.046
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13770-0
01:00:09.466 --> 01:00:09.876
All of you.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13773-0
01:00:09.886 --> 01:00:10.346
What do you think?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13780-0
01:00:12.176 --> 01:00:14.186
Yes, both of them are correct.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13793-0
01:00:14.616 --> 01:00:17.486
Yeah, both of them are going to
give me the correct answer.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13809-0
01:00:17.496 --> 01:00:22.683
It is going to give me the top
most mark now, which is better,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13809-1
01:00:22.683 --> 01:00:23.176
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13819-0
01:00:23.466 --> 01:00:25.826
So again, this is a very
ambiguous question, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13823-0
01:00:25.836 --> 01:00:26.456
Which is better?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13853-0
01:00:26.466 --> 01:00:30.005
Meaning how is it based on, you
know which metric similar to our

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13853-1
01:00:30.005 --> 01:00:33.381
cricket question we told give me
some metrics, is it based on

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13853-2
01:00:33.381 --> 01:00:33.816
wickets?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13857-0
01:00:33.826 --> 01:00:34.996
Is it based on hundreds?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13867-0
01:00:35.006 --> 01:00:36.736
Is it based on number of World
Cups?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13879-0
01:00:36.746 --> 01:00:38.596
One as a captain, what is it?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13894-0
01:00:39.006 --> 01:00:43.476
Similarly, for an algorithm, we
will have two main criterias.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13896-0
01:00:44.276 --> 01:00:44.436
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13908-0
01:00:45.466 --> 01:00:48.156
One is called the running time,
one is called the space used.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13918-0
01:00:49.236 --> 01:00:52.206
Yeah, running time means lesser.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13924-0
01:00:52.216 --> 01:00:55.726
The running time better be
algorithm, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13956-0
01:00:56.056 --> 01:00:59.951
And the space used means lesser
the space used better the

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13956-1
01:00:59.951 --> 01:01:04.248
algorithm, but off late for the
last couple of years, the space

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13956-2
01:01:04.248 --> 01:01:05.456
complexity is not.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13975-0
01:01:05.506 --> 01:01:08.688
You know very much important
these days because of, you know,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13975-1
01:01:08.688 --> 01:01:10.176
a lot of advanced techniques.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13979-0
01:01:10.186 --> 01:01:11.576
Hardware has become cheap.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/13994-0
01:01:11.626 --> 01:01:14.596
You're able to store tons of
data even in main memory.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14018-0
01:01:14.966 --> 01:01:18.371
There are advanced strategies
like you know your master slave

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14018-1
01:01:18.371 --> 01:01:21.556
architectures, right, your
Hadoop architecture and so on.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14028-0
01:01:21.836 --> 01:01:24.356
So space is not a very big
problem.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14085-0
01:01:24.846 --> 01:01:28.261
Of course, there are researchers
still working on all this, but

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14085-1
01:01:28.261 --> 01:01:31.249
if you are application
developer, if you are just going

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14085-2
01:01:31.249 --> 01:01:34.557
to solve problems, if you are
not going to do research and so

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14085-3
01:01:34.557 --> 01:01:37.919
on, then all that you are going
to be concerned is the running

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14085-4
01:01:37.919 --> 01:01:39.946
time of it, not the space
complexity.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14101-0
01:01:40.416 --> 01:01:44.884
So in this whole course, we will
be focusing a lot on the running

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14101-1
01:01:44.884 --> 01:01:45.696
time, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14111-0
01:01:45.866 --> 01:01:48.736
The one which runs faster are
better algorithms.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14118-0
01:01:48.826 --> 01:01:49.906
Is this clear for all of you?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14121-0
01:01:52.746 --> 01:01:53.096
Yes.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14123-0
01:01:53.106 --> 01:01:53.376
No.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14130-0
01:01:53.386 --> 01:01:55.856
Maybe are the metrics clear,
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14148-0
01:01:56.266 --> 01:01:59.439
Any algorithm that you evaluate,
you'll be evaluating based on

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14148-1
01:01:59.439 --> 01:02:00.446
the time complexity.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14157-0
01:02:01.296 --> 01:02:03.416
The lesser the time it takes,
the better it is.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14164-0
01:02:04.266 --> 01:02:04.426
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14175-0
01:02:05.446 --> 01:02:08.376
And it is again proportional to
the size of it, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14192-0
01:02:08.386 --> 01:02:11.807
If you have just two numbers
versus sorting 2000 numbers, it

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14192-1
01:02:11.807 --> 01:02:13.096
is not the same, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14200-0
01:02:13.106 --> 01:02:14.236
It is going to take more time.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14220-0
01:02:14.246 --> 01:02:17.716
It is going to take more space
and you know it is proportional

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14220-1
01:02:17.716 --> 01:02:18.486
to your input.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14229-0
01:02:20.256 --> 01:02:21.886
Like these question, why not
consider space?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14237-0
01:02:21.896 --> 01:02:22.716
So yeah, you can do that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14264-0
01:02:22.726 --> 01:02:26.048
Yeah, if you have, you know you
can also consider that, but it

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14264-1
01:02:26.048 --> 01:02:29.001
is not relatively important
these days because space is

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14264-2
01:02:29.001 --> 01:02:30.266
becoming cheaper, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14272-0
01:02:30.276 --> 01:02:31.486
I can store a lot of data.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14287-0
01:02:31.496 --> 01:02:35.000
Also, I don't have a problem
with that right back in those

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14287-1
01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:35.296
days.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14290-0
01:02:35.306 --> 01:02:36.676
Space was also constrained.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14301-0
01:02:36.746 --> 01:02:39.916
Yeah, there were constraints on
don't use extra data structures.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14316-0
01:02:40.206 --> 01:02:43.466
Don't keep using variables right
then there was a problem with

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14316-1
01:02:43.466 --> 01:02:43.776
space.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14394-0
01:02:44.226 --> 01:02:47.708
That is why you know, it was a
very big deal, but today also

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14394-1
01:02:47.708 --> 01:02:51.190
for a couple of problems, it is
still necessary and so on or

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14394-2
01:02:51.190 --> 01:02:54.843
when your architecture becomes
tricky, right when you are given

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14394-3
01:02:54.843 --> 01:02:58.153
very constrained resources that
you are going to run your

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14394-4
01:02:58.153 --> 01:03:01.864
solution in a smart watch which
has only say you know 182 or you

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14394-5
01:03:01.864 --> 01:03:05.060
know bits or something, then
your whole, you know space

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14394-6
01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:06.886
complexity also comes in, right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14417-0
01:03:09.256 --> 01:03:12.371
So now we have already learned
about better means you know more

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14417-1
01:03:12.371 --> 01:03:14.706
efficient algorithm is based on
time and space.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14428-0
01:03:15.276 --> 01:03:17.596
But how do you measure the
running time of an algorithm?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14439-0
01:03:19.436 --> 01:03:22.036
Please give a few more examples
to understand resource usage.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14448-0
01:03:22.046 --> 01:03:23.496
Are resource means it is only
two?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14467-0
01:03:23.556 --> 01:03:27.136
Yeah, it is your time and your
space and your CPU and all that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14480-0
01:03:27.466 --> 01:03:31.500
What we are meaning is it is
proportional to the input size,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14480-1
01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:31.896
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14495-0
01:03:31.906 --> 01:03:35.986
For example, if I'm telling you
to add, say 2 numbers, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14506-0
01:03:36.876 --> 01:03:39.406
Adding two numbers and adding
2,00,000 numbers.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14525-0
01:03:39.416 --> 01:03:43.390
Is it the same right now for two
numbers, the time complexity and

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14525-1
01:03:43.390 --> 01:03:45.316
space complexity will be lesser.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14538-0
01:03:46.186 --> 01:03:48.416
Whereas when you have 2,00,000
numbers it is more.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14556-0
01:03:48.506 --> 01:03:51.989
That is what we are telling that
the resources needed by your

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14556-1
01:03:51.989 --> 01:03:54.236
algorithm is proportional to the
input.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14573-0
01:03:55.196 --> 01:03:58.834
If you have a larger input, then
of course you will have a larger

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14573-1
01:03:58.834 --> 01:03:59.826
complexity, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14576-0
01:04:02.076 --> 01:04:02.386
Cool.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14582-0
01:04:02.396 --> 01:04:03.066
So what about this?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14590-0
01:04:04.066 --> 01:04:04.806
It's all fine.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14600-0
01:04:04.816 --> 01:04:07.447
Time complexity, space
complexity, lesser the time,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14600-1
01:04:07.447 --> 01:04:08.306
lesser the space.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14615-0
01:04:08.316 --> 01:04:11.563
It is better understood, but how
do I measure the running time of

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14615-1
01:04:11.563 --> 01:04:11.956
an algo?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14625-0
01:04:13.186 --> 01:04:16.986
Yeah, one way to do that is
experimental studies.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14647-0
01:04:17.536 --> 01:04:21.150
Yeah, what I can do is you know,
I'll, I'll give you those same

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14647-1
01:04:21.150 --> 01:04:22.166
two people, right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14660-0
01:04:22.176 --> 01:04:24.966
What they can do is they will
try to write that program.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14672-0
01:04:25.516 --> 01:04:27.016
They will all, you know, the
algorithm.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14704-0
01:04:27.026 --> 01:04:30.093
They'll implement it and they
will try to run it on different

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14704-1
01:04:30.093 --> 01:04:33.210
data sets of varying size and
what they can do is they can put

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14704-2
01:04:33.210 --> 01:04:34.446
like a time stamp, right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14727-0
01:04:34.506 --> 01:04:37.620
In Java you can do something
like system dot current timely

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14727-1
01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:39.696
second or in Python you can do
time it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14748-0
01:04:40.076 --> 01:04:43.269
If you put that, it will just
print the time stamp it took to

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14748-1
01:04:43.269 --> 01:04:44.556
run the you know program.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14783-0
01:04:45.066 --> 01:04:48.258
So you can keep, you know,
running like that and you will

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14783-1
01:04:48.258 --> 01:04:51.615
plot it in a graph like this,
where for example if 10 is the

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14783-2
01:04:51.615 --> 01:04:54.036
input it took, you know say 8
milliseconds.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14813-0
01:04:54.466 --> 01:04:58.200
When, say, 50 is your N means
input, when your input is 50

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14813-1
01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:02.314
elements then it took say maybe
around, you know 13 milliseconds

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14813-2
01:05:02.314 --> 01:05:02.946
and so on.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14824-0
01:05:03.076 --> 01:05:04.906
So you will plot a graph like
this.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14833-0
01:05:05.276 --> 01:05:07.626
Both of them will have plotted
their graphs.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14855-0
01:05:07.756 --> 01:05:10.395
You'll compare those two graphs
and you will be able to see

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14855-1
01:05:10.395 --> 01:05:11.626
which one of them is better.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14860-0
01:05:12.646 --> 01:05:13.316
What do you see?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14864-0
01:05:13.326 --> 01:05:14.166
Any problems with this?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14888-0
01:05:17.736 --> 01:05:21.425
Yeah, real quick, guys, do you
see any problems with this

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14888-1
01:05:21.425 --> 01:05:24.922
approach when you want to
measure running time through

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14888-2
01:05:24.922 --> 01:05:25.176
you?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14892-0
01:05:25.186 --> 01:05:25.576
Always.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14910-0
01:05:25.586 --> 01:05:29.443
You know, write a program, run
it, put a time stamp, put a

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14910-1
01:05:29.443 --> 01:05:31.076
graph and all this right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14922-0
01:05:32.226 --> 01:05:36.666
There is a lot of problems in
this, yeah, several limitations.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14944-0
01:05:36.936 --> 01:05:39.930
First things first, it is
necessary to implement and test

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14944-1
01:05:39.930 --> 01:05:42.716
the algorithm in order to
determine its running time.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14946-0
01:05:43.256 --> 01:05:43.706
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14959-0
01:05:43.756 --> 01:05:46.516
First of all, both of them
should be aware of

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14959-1
01:05:46.516 --> 01:05:47.416
implementation.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14961-0
01:05:47.796 --> 01:05:48.376
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14984-0
01:05:48.436 --> 01:05:52.120
What if Amit is implementing in
say, assembly language and

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14984-1
01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:55.866
vertika is doing it in say a
high level language like Java?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/14996-0
01:05:57.266 --> 01:05:59.626
Yeah, I think I know only Java.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15003-0
01:05:59.676 --> 01:06:00.456
She is doing it in Java.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15014-0
01:06:01.326 --> 01:06:02.776
It is Amit on the other extreme.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15024-0
01:06:02.786 --> 01:06:04.736
He goes ahead and writes the
whole solution.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15028-0
01:06:04.746 --> 01:06:06.836
His algorithm in assembly
language?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15037-0
01:06:07.186 --> 01:06:08.206
Which of them will be fast?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15043-0
01:06:09.716 --> 01:06:10.866
It's a no brainer, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15065-0
01:06:10.876 --> 01:06:12.966
Assembly language directly, you
know.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15078-0
01:06:13.056 --> 01:06:16.593
We'll get translated to your
binary and it'll go execute,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15078-1
01:06:16.593 --> 01:06:19.276
whereas your Java has a lot of
other steps.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15084-0
01:06:19.286 --> 01:06:21.606
Your JVM compilation, whatnot,
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15097-0
01:06:21.876 --> 01:06:24.336
So then you are not comparing
the same things right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15111-0
01:06:24.346 --> 01:06:27.341
You are comparing an apple with
an orange, which is a problem,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15111-1
01:06:27.341 --> 01:06:27.626
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15130-0
01:06:28.556 --> 01:06:32.655
So that is the first problem and
first of all you should know

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15130-1
01:06:32.655 --> 01:06:34.506
about the language, correct?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15143-0
01:06:34.636 --> 01:06:36.836
Someone should know a
programming language to even

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15143-1
01:06:36.836 --> 01:06:37.396
implement it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15150-0
01:06:38.286 --> 01:06:41.226
So does problem solving need
programming skills?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15155-0
01:06:43.176 --> 01:06:43.336
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15167-0
01:06:44.626 --> 01:06:46.636
So this whole field is called CT
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15169-0
01:06:46.646 --> 01:06:47.506
Computational thinking.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15175-0
01:06:48.186 --> 01:06:51.156
Computational thinking is not
equal to programming.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15192-0
01:06:51.646 --> 01:06:54.981
Yeah, there can be someone who
can solve any problem, but he

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15192-1
01:06:54.981 --> 01:06:56.456
cannot necessarily code it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15199-0
01:06:56.506 --> 01:06:58.156
He doesn't know any programming
language.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15204-0
01:06:58.166 --> 01:06:58.896
It is possible.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15216-0
01:06:59.306 --> 01:07:01.796
Yeah, I know a lot of people,
even school kids these days.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15237-0
01:07:02.146 --> 01:07:04.997
Yeah, there are a lot of school
kids who don't know any

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15237-1
01:07:04.997 --> 01:07:07.796
programming, but they are
computationally very strong.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15253-0
01:07:08.186 --> 01:07:11.536
Yeah, they will be able to give
a solution to the problem,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15253-1
01:07:11.536 --> 01:07:11.876
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15275-0
01:07:11.946 --> 01:07:15.808
This is what in RH or maybe you
know back in those days we used

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15275-1
01:07:15.808 --> 01:07:17.376
to call puzzles and so on.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15282-0
01:07:17.386 --> 01:07:18.016
You remember those?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15290-0
01:07:18.876 --> 01:07:20.366
They used to be a book full of
puzzles.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15293-0
01:07:20.836 --> 01:07:21.086
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15301-0
01:07:21.096 --> 01:07:22.346
Where you just solved the
puzzle.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15308-0
01:07:22.356 --> 01:07:24.746
You are not writing any code
there, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15319-0
01:07:24.876 --> 01:07:27.266
But every puzzle is nothing but
a problem, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15327-0
01:07:27.276 --> 01:07:28.906
You're trying to solve the
puzzle.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15343-0
01:07:29.196 --> 01:07:33.186
It is nothing but solving, you
know, an actual computing

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15343-1
01:07:33.186 --> 01:07:34.236
problem. Right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15346-0
01:07:35.116 --> 01:07:35.356
Right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15360-0
01:07:36.726 --> 01:07:39.656
So computational thinking and
programming is not the same.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15394-0
01:07:39.806 --> 01:07:42.730
So if some people are there who
are able to solve the puzzles or

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15394-1
01:07:42.730 --> 01:07:45.473
give me solutions, but they
don't know programming, then how

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15394-2
01:07:45.473 --> 01:07:47.856
will you compare it so that is
the first limitation.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15408-0
01:07:48.206 --> 01:07:51.116
Firstly, you need to implement
it, which is extra time effort.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15413-0
01:07:51.126 --> 01:07:52.186
All that which is a problem.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15442-0
01:07:53.596 --> 01:07:57.257
Second one experiments can be
done only on a limited set of

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15442-1
01:07:57.257 --> 01:08:00.979
input and may not be indicative
of the running time of other

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15442-2
01:08:00.979 --> 01:08:01.406
inputs.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15457-0
01:08:01.896 --> 01:08:04.506
So here you are only running it
for these many inputs.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15468-0
01:08:04.716 --> 01:08:07.556
You're not running it for all
the inputs possible, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15483-0
01:08:07.566 --> 01:08:10.531
So that is again a problem when
you talk about experiment, it

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15483-1
01:08:10.531 --> 01:08:11.296
becomes limited.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15503-0
01:08:11.376 --> 01:08:16.246
You cannot consider everything
right and then second, this is

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15503-1
01:08:16.246 --> 01:08:19.466
not hardware software agnostic,
correct?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15535-0
01:08:19.556 --> 01:08:23.031
For example, in this case a
Vertica is using a I-9 processor

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15535-1
01:08:23.031 --> 01:08:26.278
and Amit on the other hand is
running, say our dual core

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15535-2
01:08:26.278 --> 01:08:26.676
system.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15543-0
01:08:26.736 --> 01:08:28.646
Or an old Pentium system.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15545-0
01:08:29.526 --> 01:08:29.796
Right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15581-0
01:08:29.806 --> 01:08:32.949
Again, you are not comparing the
same right one is the latest

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15581-1
01:08:32.949 --> 01:08:36.092
architecture which has so many
registers and it is very fast,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15581-2
01:08:36.092 --> 01:08:38.982
whereas on the other hand you
have, you know, a very old

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15581-3
01:08:38.982 --> 01:08:39.336
system.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15589-0
01:08:40.156 --> 01:08:42.236
Then again, are you doing
justice by comparing?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15593-0
01:08:43.576 --> 01:08:45.376
Not really right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15602-0
01:08:45.666 --> 01:08:46.776
So again, there is a problem.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15621-0
01:08:47.696 --> 01:08:51.539
So if experimental studies is
not the way to evaluate running

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15621-1
01:08:51.539 --> 01:08:53.336
time, then how do we do this?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15626-0
01:08:55.056 --> 01:08:55.886
Got any ideas guys?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15633-0
01:08:58.456 --> 01:08:59.366
You are real quick.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15635-0
01:08:59.626 --> 01:09:00.206
Any ideas?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15653-0
01:09:02.646 --> 01:09:04.841
We just agreed that
experimentation is not a great

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15653-1
01:09:04.841 --> 01:09:06.346
way because you have to
implement.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15676-0
01:09:06.356 --> 01:09:10.128
You should have exactly the same
software, same hardware, exactly

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15676-1
01:09:10.128 --> 01:09:13.156
same configurations, and then
you'll have to run it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15683-0
01:09:13.206 --> 01:09:15.456
It is not always possible,
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15702-0
01:09:15.566 --> 01:09:20.022
That is why we go about a
standard model, which is called

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15702-1
01:09:20.022 --> 01:09:22.096
an analytical model, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15727-0
01:09:22.206 --> 01:09:25.781
We all will now imagine a
machine in mind, and in that

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15727-1
01:09:25.781 --> 01:09:29.096
machine we will all try to
analyze our algorithms.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15738-0
01:09:29.586 --> 01:09:33.146
That machine is the analytical
model.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15753-0
01:09:34.116 --> 01:09:36.992
We will now develop a general
methodology for analyzing the

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15753-1
01:09:36.992 --> 01:09:38.286
running time of algorithms.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15758-0
01:09:38.296 --> 01:09:39.026
Very important guys.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15761-0
01:09:39.036 --> 01:09:39.666
Yeah, all of you.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15777-0
01:09:39.676 --> 01:09:41.666
Yeah, it is not big go big Theta
and so on.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15782-0
01:09:41.676 --> 01:09:42.846
Yeah, don't get confused.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15795-0
01:09:42.856 --> 01:09:45.626
Yeah, we'll learn about that
also, but this is not that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15803-0
01:09:46.076 --> 01:09:47.446
Yeah, all of you here back
again?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15819-0
01:09:47.456 --> 01:09:50.842
Yeah, we learned that
experimental studies has a lot

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15819-1
01:09:50.842 --> 01:09:51.736
of limitation.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15831-0
01:09:51.746 --> 01:09:54.256
I'll have to run it in, you
know, put a time stamp.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15839-0
01:09:54.266 --> 01:09:55.596
Put a graph, compare it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15846-0
01:09:55.786 --> 01:09:57.876
It should all be same hardware
software.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15853-0
01:09:57.886 --> 01:09:58.996
I should implement it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15862-0
01:09:59.066 --> 01:10:02.216
All these disadvantages are
there, so we will not do that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15876-0
01:10:02.746 --> 01:10:06.416
It will be so cool if I can
directly evaluate an algorithm.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15884-0
01:10:07.096 --> 01:10:08.706
Yeah, that is what we will do.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15920-0
01:10:09.116 --> 01:10:12.525
So we are going to develop a
general model uses a high level

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15920-1
01:10:12.525 --> 01:10:15.822
description of the algorithm
instead of testing one of its

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15920-2
01:10:15.822 --> 01:10:19.006
implementations, we will not
write the algorithm at all.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15922-0
01:10:19.356 --> 01:10:19.966
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15930-0
01:10:20.056 --> 01:10:22.126
Take into account all possible
inputs.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15954-0
01:10:22.456 --> 01:10:26.016
Yeah, and allows one to evaluate
the efficiency of any algorithm

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15954-1
01:10:26.016 --> 01:10:29.356
in a way that is independent
from the hardware and software.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15956-0
01:10:30.186 --> 01:10:30.416
Right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15961-0
01:10:30.426 --> 01:10:31.256
And what is that model?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15989-0
01:10:33.656 --> 01:10:35.646
Of course, these are all
dependent the running time

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15989-1
01:10:35.646 --> 01:10:37.826
depends on, you know single
processor or multiprocessor.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/15993-0
01:10:37.836 --> 01:10:39.086
Read write speed.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16001-0
01:10:39.196 --> 01:10:40.626
The input given, and so on.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16017-0
01:10:40.776 --> 01:10:44.343
So that is why we are now coming
to a general model and that is

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16017-1
01:10:44.343 --> 01:10:44.956
called RAM.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16027-0
01:10:46.286 --> 01:10:48.856
Yeah, Ramesh stands for random
access machine.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16034-0
01:10:48.866 --> 01:10:50.256
This is not your RAM, ROM.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16038-0
01:10:50.266 --> 01:10:50.936
Yeah, that one.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16046-0
01:10:50.946 --> 01:10:54.316
Yeah, this is a imaginary
machine.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16060-0
01:10:54.386 --> 01:10:57.326
Yeah, it is a machine
independent way to analyze

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16060-1
01:10:57.326 --> 01:10:57.986
algorithms.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16063-0
01:10:59.246 --> 01:10:59.456
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16069-0
01:10:59.466 --> 01:10:59.936
Is this clear?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16079-0
01:10:59.946 --> 01:11:02.736
Guys, all of you, is there a
real machine like this?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16086-0
01:11:04.786 --> 01:11:05.676
Yes it does, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16120-0
01:11:05.686 --> 01:11:09.023
Because if you have 32 bit 264
bit based on how much you can

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16120-1
01:11:09.023 --> 01:11:12.140
store what is your, you know
register size, what is your

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16120-2
01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:12.796
clock speed?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16126-0
01:11:12.806 --> 01:11:14.766
All that matters, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16152-0
01:11:14.776 --> 01:11:18.025
That is why you have your cost,
subject, analytical model means

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16152-1
01:11:18.025 --> 01:11:20.867
it's a link between system
description and design model

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16152-2
01:11:20.867 --> 01:11:21.476
description.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16173-0
01:11:21.646 --> 01:11:25.317
Yeah, it is more of an imaginary
machine where we all will try to

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16173-1
01:11:25.317 --> 01:11:26.596
analyze our algorithms.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16179-0
01:11:26.966 --> 01:11:27.796
I wrote algorithm.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16189-0
01:11:27.806 --> 01:11:30.816
You write algorithm a someone
else writes BCD.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16200-0
01:11:31.186 --> 01:11:32.956
We will not run it in systems.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16219-0
01:11:33.186 --> 01:11:36.734
We will all imagine this in our
mind and we will try to analyze

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16219-1
01:11:36.734 --> 01:11:38.396
our algorithm on this machine.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16230-0
01:11:39.626 --> 01:11:41.436
Yeah, we're all bringing them
into a fair ground.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16234-0
01:11:42.366 --> 01:11:42.576
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16239-0
01:11:42.586 --> 01:11:43.236
Does it make sense?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16245-0
01:11:43.246 --> 01:11:43.586
All of you.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16250-0
01:11:45.246 --> 01:11:47.106
This machine doesn't exist in
reality.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16254-0
01:11:47.116 --> 01:11:47.416
Correct.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16259-0
01:11:47.426 --> 01:11:49.056
It is called random access
machine.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16264-0
01:11:49.286 --> 01:11:50.156
It is a model.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16271-0
01:11:50.166 --> 01:11:51.456
It is just a model computer.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16280-0
01:11:51.966 --> 01:11:54.876
Yeah, this model assumes a
single processor.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16304-0
01:11:55.186 --> 01:11:58.376
Yeah, it is not having many
processors and all that it is

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16304-1
01:11:58.376 --> 01:12:00.796
having just one processor in the
RAM model.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16319-0
01:12:01.086 --> 01:12:04.103
Instructions are executed one
after the other with no

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16319-1
01:12:04.103 --> 01:12:05.276
concurrent operation.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16335-0
01:12:05.926 --> 01:12:09.366
This model doesn't allow that
line by line, only it can

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16335-1
01:12:09.366 --> 01:12:11.516
execute this model of
computation.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16350-0
01:12:11.526 --> 01:12:14.791
Is an abstraction that allows us
to compare algorithms on the

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16350-1
01:12:14.791 --> 01:12:15.896
basis of performance.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16361-0
01:12:16.306 --> 01:12:20.816
Now both of them right will use
this model.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16380-0
01:12:20.826 --> 01:12:23.542
They're not run it in their own
computers and put a graph and

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16380-1
01:12:23.542 --> 01:12:23.936
all that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16386-0
01:12:24.026 --> 01:12:25.926
Both of them will imagine this
machine.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16408-0
01:12:27.816 --> 01:12:31.201
The assumptions made in the RAM
model to accomplish this are

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16408-1
01:12:31.201 --> 01:12:33.586
each simple operation takes one
time unit.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16426-0
01:12:33.896 --> 01:12:36.384
Yeah, every operation you do
addition, that is one time unit,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16426-1
01:12:36.384 --> 01:12:37.106
you do assignment.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16432-0
01:12:37.116 --> 01:12:38.026
That is one time unit.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16454-0
01:12:38.376 --> 01:12:41.335
Every operation, simple
operation we will learn about

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16454-1
01:12:41.335 --> 01:12:43.746
this in the next few slides
takes one time.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16463-0
01:12:43.756 --> 01:12:48.386
Unit loops and subroutines are
not simple operation, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16476-0
01:12:48.456 --> 01:12:50.966
If you have a loop, it has many
other simple operation.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16529-0
01:12:51.456 --> 01:12:55.048
If you have a subroutine or
function that has a lot more

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16529-1
01:12:55.048 --> 01:12:58.828
simple operations within it, so
you should not call that as

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16529-2
01:12:58.828 --> 01:13:02.987
simple operation and each memory
access takes one time unit again

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16529-3
01:13:02.987 --> 01:13:06.515
and there is no shortage of
memory, we believe there is

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16529-4
01:13:06.515 --> 01:13:07.586
unbounded memory.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16537-0
01:13:07.956 --> 01:13:09.266
Yeah, there's no problem with
memory.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16544-0
01:13:09.276 --> 01:13:13.186
Is what this model assumes
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16560-0
01:13:13.196 --> 01:13:15.611
For example, you have the
location counter where you have

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16560-1
01:13:15.611 --> 01:13:16.776
the next instruction to run.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16567-0
01:13:17.056 --> 01:13:17.756
You have the program.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16578-0
01:13:18.976 --> 01:13:22.026
It is going and fetching from
thing from my input tape.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16586-0
01:13:22.096 --> 01:13:23.406
How many time units does it
take?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16592-0
01:13:25.306 --> 01:13:26.106
Yeah, real quick guys.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16608-0
01:13:27.096 --> 01:13:29.462
We learned that in the RAM model
one time unit you go fetch

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16608-1
01:13:29.462 --> 01:13:29.856
something.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16614-0
01:13:29.866 --> 01:13:30.666
It is one time unit.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16621-0
01:13:30.916 --> 01:13:32.786
You are going and writing an
output somewhere.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16629-0
01:13:32.796 --> 01:13:33.946
How many time units is that?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16635-0
01:13:34.226 --> 01:13:35.226
There is also one time unit.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16639-0
01:13:36.276 --> 01:13:36.436
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16653-0
01:13:37.196 --> 01:13:39.556
And if I want to, you know, go
ahead and read the memory.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16660-0
01:13:39.566 --> 01:13:40.806
You see the dots here, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16673-0
01:13:40.956 --> 01:13:43.106
It is dot dot dot meaning it is
unbounded.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16681-0
01:13:43.646 --> 01:13:45.706
All the memory that you want is
available.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16690-0
01:13:45.946 --> 01:13:47.516
That is what this model offers
you.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16715-0
01:13:48.276 --> 01:13:51.835
Right then the time complexity
or running time becomes the

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16715-1
01:13:51.835 --> 01:13:55.756
number of instructions executed
and space complexity becomes the

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16715-2
01:13:55.756 --> 01:13:57.686
number of memory cells accessed.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16718-0
01:13:59.036 --> 01:13:59.536
Simple right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16741-0
01:14:00.536 --> 01:14:04.081
So all of you understood the RAM
model, the RAM model is needed

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16741-1
01:14:04.081 --> 01:14:07.016
because experimental studies are
not very effective.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16775-0
01:14:07.026 --> 01:14:10.199
They have several limitations,
so all of us are now in the same

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16775-1
01:14:10.199 --> 01:14:10.496
pitch.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16791-0
01:14:11.296 --> 01:14:14.750
When I give you a new problem to
solve, all of you will solve it

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16791-1
01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:18.203
in different different ways, but
all of you will analyze in this

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16791-2
01:14:18.203 --> 01:14:18.946
model in mind.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16804-0
01:14:19.096 --> 01:14:21.642
You will imagine you are going
to run your solution in this

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16804-1
01:14:21.642 --> 01:14:21.896
model.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16806-0
01:14:23.306 --> 01:14:23.936
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16814-0
01:14:24.166 --> 01:14:25.386
Chandra, which part is not
clear?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16823-0
01:14:27.036 --> 01:14:30.086
The random access machine is a
imaginary machine.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16831-0
01:14:30.176 --> 01:14:32.186
It is not existing right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16848-0
01:14:32.476 --> 01:14:35.931
It is a machine which has a lot
of assumptions that it has only

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16848-1
01:14:35.931 --> 01:14:36.686
one processor.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16859-0
01:14:36.956 --> 01:14:39.866
It has, you know, any operation
takes one time unit.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16864-0
01:14:40.096 --> 01:14:41.506
There is unbounded memory.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16891-0
01:14:41.656 --> 01:14:45.639
These are all the assumptions of
that imaginary computer, and

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16891-1
01:14:45.639 --> 01:14:49.621
whenever we want to analyze our
algorithm, we will go to this

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16891-2
01:14:49.621 --> 01:14:50.006
model.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16920-0
01:14:50.086 --> 01:14:53.908
We will imagine that this is the
machine where my algorithm is

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16920-1
01:14:53.908 --> 01:14:57.366
going to run and we are going to
analyze it in that way.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16930-0
01:14:57.376 --> 01:14:59.186
All of us are coming to the same
page.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16942-0
01:14:59.796 --> 01:15:02.646
Otherwise you will implement it
and run it in I7 processor.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16953-0
01:15:02.656 --> 01:15:04.306
I will do it in, you know, I3.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16961-0
01:15:04.476 --> 01:15:06.146
There will be a lot of
discrepancies.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16970-0
01:15:06.156 --> 01:15:07.286
I will write it in Java.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16976-0
01:15:07.296 --> 01:15:09.196
You will write it in binary,
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16996-0
01:15:09.206 --> 01:15:12.547
There are problems, so we are
all coming to the same page by

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16996-1
01:15:12.547 --> 01:15:13.696
coming to this model.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/16998-0
01:15:14.676 --> 01:15:15.086
Is that clear?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17001-0
01:15:17.356 --> 01:15:17.666
Yes.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17005-0
01:15:17.676 --> 01:15:18.216
No, all of you.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17017-0
01:15:20.836 --> 01:15:22.076
Is this a common model used?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17027-0
01:15:22.086 --> 01:15:23.786
Practically, nowadays, yes, it
is still used.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17044-0
01:15:23.796 --> 01:15:27.473
Yeah, it is a fundamental of
theoretical computer science and

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17044-1
01:15:27.473 --> 01:15:28.836
it is still used, yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17053-0
01:15:32.976 --> 01:15:34.026
We take a very short break.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17067-0
01:15:34.036 --> 01:15:36.821
Yeah, we'll come back in 5
minutes and we will continue

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17067-1
01:15:36.821 --> 01:15:37.616
from here, yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17088-0
01:15:41.866 --> 01:15:44.226
Meanwhile, I'll still be around
if you have any other general

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17088-1
01:15:44.226 --> 01:15:45.976
questions or anything we can
chat about that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17100-0
01:15:52.416 --> 01:15:54.156
Yeah, a couple of you had raised
hands.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17102-0
01:15:55.156 --> 01:15:56.196
The hands still remains.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17121-0
01:16:06.006 --> 01:16:08.343
I will come back in just five
minutes and then we'll again

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17121-1
01:16:08.343 --> 01:16:08.936
continue, yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17135-0
01:16:20.636 --> 01:16:23.556
Yeah, there's a question, sorry,
off topic.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17144-0
01:16:23.566 --> 01:16:25.216
When we visit the campus, yes,
of course you can.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17154-0
01:16:25.226 --> 01:16:26.636
There is no actual need.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17173-0
01:16:26.866 --> 01:16:30.874
We'll students need not come to
campus, but if you just want to

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17173-1
01:16:30.874 --> 01:16:32.126
visit, then you can.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17184-0
01:16:33.646 --> 01:16:35.596
But but you'll not know anyone
there, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17199-0
01:16:35.606 --> 01:16:38.016
All your faculties are off
campus faculties.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17218-0
01:16:38.406 --> 01:16:40.800
So in the actual campus, you
will not know anyone, you will

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17218-1
01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:42.196
not have any, you know work to
do.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17232-0
01:16:42.346 --> 01:16:44.386
You will not be allowed into
hostels or all that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17242-0
01:16:45.706 --> 01:16:47.246
Yeah, just to give a glimpse, of
course you can.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17270-0
01:16:49.386 --> 01:16:51.735
And uh, your seniors, of course,
they have also started, you

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17270-1
01:16:51.735 --> 01:16:54.084
know, something new where, you
know, they had a conversation

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17270-2
01:16:54.084 --> 01:16:54.276
also.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17275-0
01:16:55.056 --> 01:16:55.566
Yeah, I know.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17292-0
01:16:55.576 --> 01:16:59.559
Hyderabad campus last week 19th
there was a convocation for will

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17292-1
01:16:59.559 --> 01:17:00.906
students specifically.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17313-0
01:17:01.356 --> 01:17:04.223
Yeah, but not everyone will be
invited because there is, you

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17313-1
01:17:04.223 --> 01:17:05.726
know, a lot of students in WILP.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17344-0
01:17:06.416 --> 01:17:09.267
So maybe someone who has scored
well, or someone who's very

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17344-1
01:17:09.267 --> 01:17:12.166
genuinely interested they can,
you know, write an email and,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17344-2
01:17:12.166 --> 01:17:13.116
you know, attend it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17351-0
01:17:14.606 --> 01:17:16.266
Concurrent operations are not
possible.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17358-0
01:17:16.276 --> 01:17:17.156
Render model yes.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17363-0
01:17:17.206 --> 01:17:18.216
Yeah, Prakriti are right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17367-0
01:17:18.566 --> 01:17:19.816
That model doesn't allow it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17389-0
01:17:20.236 --> 01:17:22.949
Yeah, there are other models
also, but we will always stick

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17389-1
01:17:22.949 --> 01:17:25.526
to this model and it doesn't
allow concurrent operation.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17428-0
01:17:26.686 --> 01:17:29.745
How do we know the number of
memory cells accessed without

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17428-1
01:17:29.745 --> 01:17:33.011
writing some code directly from
the pseudo code we will get to

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17428-2
01:17:33.011 --> 01:17:36.277
know that Santosh yeah we will
learn about that further today,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17428-3
01:17:36.277 --> 01:17:36.536
yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17443-0
01:17:38.846 --> 01:17:41.826
Directly we will be able to know
in RAM.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17452-0
01:17:41.836 --> 01:17:44.026
We have a standard way of
performing experimental study.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17458-0
01:17:44.036 --> 01:17:45.116
Which language is used here?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17469-0
01:17:45.126 --> 01:17:47.586
No, we don't have any
experimental study at all here.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17475-0
01:17:48.076 --> 01:17:49.566
Yeah, we will proceed further.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17484-0
01:17:49.576 --> 01:17:52.256
You will get a better hang of
it, yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17515-0
01:17:59.776 --> 01:18:02.581
So their placement in this
program, no, it is not because

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17515-1
01:18:02.581 --> 01:18:05.724
this whole program relies on the
fundamental aspect that you are

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17515-2
01:18:05.724 --> 01:18:06.546
already employed.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17533-0
01:18:06.856 --> 01:18:10.071
Yeah, the name itself is work
integrated learning, so it

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17533-1
01:18:10.071 --> 01:18:12.326
believes that you are already
employed.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17551-0
01:18:12.616 --> 01:18:15.005
Yeah, there is no point in again
giving you, you know, placement

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17551-1
01:18:15.005 --> 01:18:15.776
support and all that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17556-0
01:18:16.626 --> 01:18:18.066
Yeah, yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17561-0
01:18:18.076 --> 01:18:18.746
Location counter.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17571-0
01:18:18.756 --> 01:18:20.868
You'll also learn it in your
cost, subject, computer

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17571-1
01:18:20.868 --> 01:18:21.386
organization.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17595-0
01:18:21.936 --> 01:18:26.352
It is a type of a register where
you have the address of the next

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17595-1
01:18:26.352 --> 01:18:28.426
line in the program to execute.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17616-0
01:18:30.206 --> 01:18:32.958
It is also called as program
counter in some you know authors

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17616-1
01:18:32.958 --> 01:18:34.156
prefer to call it that way.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17630-0
01:18:35.366 --> 01:18:37.356
I want to know what is the next
line to execute right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17644-0
01:18:37.366 --> 01:18:40.604
I'll not know otherwise, so this
counter will have the address of

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17644-1
01:18:40.604 --> 01:18:41.486
the next location.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17655-0
01:18:46.046 --> 01:18:47.036
Yeah, but it that's right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17657-0
01:18:47.086 --> 01:18:47.396
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17665-0
01:18:47.466 --> 01:18:48.936
Are these PPTS available in
canvas?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17684-0
01:18:48.946 --> 01:18:51.842
No, it is not yet available, but
immediately after the class it

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17684-1
01:18:51.842 --> 01:18:52.656
will be available.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17691-0
01:18:53.616 --> 01:18:54.636
I will not upload slides.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17704-0
01:18:54.646 --> 01:18:56.926
Well in advance, but immediately
after my class.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17709-0
01:18:56.936 --> 01:18:57.916
That is my practice.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17728-0
01:18:58.476 --> 01:19:01.404
If the class ends by 10:30
within 1040, you will be able to

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17728-1
01:19:01.404 --> 01:19:02.136
see the slides.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17735-0
01:19:06.326 --> 01:19:06.996
In which industry?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17742-0
01:19:07.006 --> 01:19:08.016
Data science is used.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17752-0
01:19:08.026 --> 01:19:10.356
I mean now it is penetrating to
every industry.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17757-0
01:19:10.466 --> 01:19:11.686
Yeah, it's not just one.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17759-0
01:19:13.796 --> 01:19:13.946
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17771-0
01:19:17.826 --> 01:19:20.196
So where exactly do we use RAM?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17786-0
01:19:20.206 --> 01:19:23.226
Like it is embedded inside OS or
no it is not even there guys.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17788-0
01:19:23.236 --> 01:19:23.446
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17794-0
01:19:23.456 --> 01:19:24.896
So yeah, again getting confused.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17801-0
01:19:24.966 --> 01:19:26.456
Ram is an imaginary machine.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17811-0
01:19:26.506 --> 01:19:28.976
Just think about it like another
machine, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17842-0
01:19:28.986 --> 01:19:32.275
Just like your laptop or my
laptop, it is an imaginary

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17842-1
01:19:32.275 --> 01:19:35.863
machine and whenever we talk
about algorithm analysis, this

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17842-2
01:19:35.863 --> 01:19:37.896
machine comes to our mind,
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17866-0
01:19:37.956 --> 01:19:41.038
It has certain assumptions that
every operation takes 1 unit and

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17866-1
01:19:41.038 --> 01:19:42.886
so on, which all of us will
adhere to.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17872-0
01:19:43.076 --> 01:19:43.706
That is all.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17887-0
01:19:43.936 --> 01:19:46.900
It is not a real thing like
where it is an OS or it is a

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17887-1
01:19:46.900 --> 01:19:47.316
machine.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17894-0
01:19:47.326 --> 01:19:48.056
It is not a real thing.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17901-0
01:19:49.516 --> 01:19:50.656
Yeah, like a mind machine. Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17912-0
01:19:52.656 --> 01:19:54.746
Flights will be available in
teams canvas both, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17926-0
01:19:54.756 --> 01:19:56.416
No, it will be available in only
canvas.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17942-0
01:19:57.266 --> 01:20:01.680
As I told, teams is only for
live classes as well as

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17942-1
01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:02.596
recordings.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17948-0
01:20:02.946 --> 01:20:04.966
Everything else will be there in
your canvas.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17956-0
01:20:10.026 --> 01:20:12.766
Yeah, there's a lot of
questions.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17967-0
01:20:12.776 --> 01:20:14.866
We'll just wait for another
minute and get started, guys.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17974-0
01:20:14.876 --> 01:20:17.156
Yeah, please explain this model
machine.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17985-0
01:20:17.166 --> 01:20:18.256
Yeah, that is what we learned,
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/17995-0
01:20:18.266 --> 01:20:21.216
It is a model machine which has
these assumptions.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18007-0
01:20:21.486 --> 01:20:23.636
It is going to have a single
processor.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18017-0
01:20:23.726 --> 01:20:26.356
It can execute only instructions
line after line.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18032-0
01:20:26.426 --> 01:20:28.782
It cannot do multiple
instructions at the same time,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18032-1
01:20:28.782 --> 01:20:29.226
and so on.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18043-0
01:20:30.066 --> 01:20:34.791
Every operation takes one time
unit and it is having unbounded

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18043-1
01:20:34.791 --> 01:20:35.316
memory.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18057-0
01:20:35.766 --> 01:20:38.915
How many ever instructions you
run that becomes the total time,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18057-1
01:20:38.915 --> 01:20:39.406
and so on.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18066-0
01:20:40.836 --> 01:20:42.366
And there's more about this in
your text.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18073-0
01:20:42.376 --> 01:20:42.806
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18096-0
01:20:43.076 --> 01:20:45.895
And also you know I have a look
at that isram used to analyse

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18096-1
01:20:45.895 --> 01:20:47.576
space complexity of algorithms
time.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18100-0
01:20:47.586 --> 01:20:48.286
Both can be used.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18108-0
01:20:48.296 --> 01:20:49.356
That is what this line right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18120-0
01:20:49.616 --> 01:20:51.805
The number of memory cell
accessed is that space

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18120-1
01:20:51.805 --> 01:20:52.296
complexity.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18128-0
01:20:52.566 --> 01:20:54.996
The number of instructions
executed is the time complexity.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18158-0
01:20:56.566 --> 01:20:58.896
So how we manually do the
performance testing using RAM if

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18158-1
01:20:58.896 --> 01:21:01.185
we want to do in real time
scenario real time scenario we

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18158-2
01:21:01.185 --> 01:21:01.856
will not do that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18173-0
01:21:01.866 --> 01:21:05.105
Is the whole point because in
real time the same problem

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18173-1
01:21:05.105 --> 01:21:05.446
comes.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18179-0
01:21:05.456 --> 01:21:06.796
You might use some software.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18185-0
01:21:06.806 --> 01:21:07.996
You might use some hardware.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18190-0
01:21:08.006 --> 01:21:09.816
I might use something else
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18199-0
01:21:09.966 --> 01:21:11.456
Then how do you compare those
two?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18221-0
01:21:11.886 --> 01:21:15.370
So we will always compare
algorithms only on this

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18221-1
01:21:15.370 --> 01:21:18.156
theoretical basis in theoretical
basis.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18234-0
01:21:18.166 --> 01:21:21.716
If mine is better than yours,
which is good enough, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18254-0
01:21:21.726 --> 01:21:24.812
We are not concerned about the
actual implementation of it,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18254-1
01:21:24.812 --> 01:21:27.846
because actual implementation
relies on all these factors.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18264-0
01:21:28.136 --> 01:21:29.826
Which programming language I
use?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18271-0
01:21:29.876 --> 01:21:31.106
Which software I use?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18281-0
01:21:31.196 --> 01:21:33.046
Which hardware I use right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18283-0
01:21:33.296 --> 01:21:35.826
And all these, you know, become
a deal.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18309-0
01:21:37.756 --> 01:21:40.211
In short, when we analyze an
algorithm, we will be managing

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18309-1
01:21:40.211 --> 01:21:42.746
the RAM and calculating what
time it will be running exactly.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18311-0
01:21:42.756 --> 01:21:43.236
That's correct.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18322-0
01:21:45.376 --> 01:21:46.826
Yeah, all of you are in the same
page.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18326-0
01:21:46.836 --> 01:21:47.626
Let's proceed ahead.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18328-0
01:21:47.636 --> 01:21:47.736
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18330-0
01:21:49.356 --> 01:21:49.706
Yes.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18332-0
01:21:49.716 --> 01:21:50.096
No, maybe.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18335-0
01:21:56.186 --> 01:21:56.556
Cool.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18348-0
01:21:56.566 --> 01:21:59.056
So now you will learn about
something called as pseudo code.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18351-0
01:21:59.146 --> 01:21:59.286
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18377-0
01:22:00.326 --> 01:22:03.019
To someone Santosh or in
between, someone asked me like

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18377-1
01:22:03.019 --> 01:22:06.096
how do you know how much memory
you are going to access or how?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18380-0
01:22:06.106 --> 01:22:06.666
How do you know?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18398-0
01:22:06.676 --> 01:22:09.358
You know the time complexity
just from the algorithm without

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18398-1
01:22:09.358 --> 01:22:11.116
implementing, how will you know,
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18402-0
01:22:11.286 --> 01:22:11.916
He was right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18418-0
01:22:12.066 --> 01:22:14.957
We cannot directly know if you
write an English paragraph

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18418-1
01:22:14.957 --> 01:22:15.256
right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18430-0
01:22:15.266 --> 01:22:18.126
Do you all agree guys, I give
you a problem.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18436-0
01:22:18.486 --> 01:22:19.976
You write an English paragraph.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18446-0
01:22:20.156 --> 01:22:22.136
Will I be able to know anything
out of it?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18457-0
01:22:22.146 --> 01:22:24.196
Will I be able to know what
memory it accesses?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18463-0
01:22:24.206 --> 01:22:25.546
How many lines are there?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18470-0
01:22:25.666 --> 01:22:27.436
I'll not know anything, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18524-0
01:22:27.646 --> 01:22:31.600
That is why we are going to come
to a common ground and I might

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18524-1
01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:35.430
not know programming language
also, so in order to convey our

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18524-2
01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:39.446
solution or idea to fellow human
beings, we are going to come to

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18524-3
01:22:39.446 --> 01:22:42.596
a middle ground and that is
called as pseudo code.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18558-0
01:22:43.386 --> 01:22:46.808
Pseudo code is a mixture of
natural language and high level

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18558-1
01:22:46.808 --> 01:22:50.115
programming concepts that
describes the main ideas behind

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18558-2
01:22:50.115 --> 01:22:53.536
a generic implementation of a
data structure and algorithm.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18568-0
01:22:54.576 --> 01:22:56.456
It is a high level description
of an algorithm.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18589-0
01:22:57.166 --> 01:23:00.319
It is more structured than
English prose, but it is less

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18589-1
01:23:00.319 --> 01:23:01.646
detailed than a program.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18605-0
01:23:02.986 --> 01:23:06.133
It is preferred notation for
describing algorithms, and it

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18605-1
01:23:06.133 --> 01:23:08.106
hides all the program design
issues.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18613-0
01:23:09.276 --> 01:23:11.026
For example, this is a suedo
code.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18635-0
01:23:11.506 --> 01:23:15.059
There is a pseudo code to find
the maximum element in an array

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18635-1
01:23:15.059 --> 01:23:16.356
in the Python currency.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18640-0
01:23:16.366 --> 01:23:17.456
Learned right, RA?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18649-0
01:23:17.566 --> 01:23:19.386
It's a sequence of, you know,
elements, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18679-0
01:23:20.136 --> 01:23:23.556
I'm I'm given this array as well
as the number of elements as the

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18679-1
01:23:23.556 --> 01:23:26.146
input and I want to find out the
maximum element.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18685-0
01:23:27.666 --> 01:23:28.776
I've written some code here.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18699-0
01:23:29.326 --> 01:23:32.421
If I just go ahead and type this
in, any programming language,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18699-1
01:23:32.421 --> 01:23:33.206
will it execute?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18705-0
01:23:35.316 --> 01:23:35.886
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18716-0
01:23:36.016 --> 01:23:38.576
In other words, can we just run
the pseudo code?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18718-0
01:23:40.376 --> 01:23:40.676
No.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18737-0
01:23:40.966 --> 01:23:43.864
Correct, because the name itself
actually, as it says it is

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18737-1
01:23:43.864 --> 01:23:45.216
pseudo, it is not real code.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18748-0
01:23:45.606 --> 01:23:48.116
Yeah, it is just pseudo in
nature meaning.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18753-0
01:23:48.126 --> 01:23:49.016
Then why do we need it?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18767-0
01:23:49.586 --> 01:23:53.244
Because we want to communicate
our ideas between fellow human

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18767-1
01:23:53.244 --> 01:23:53.656
beings.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18776-0
01:23:54.246 --> 01:23:55.816
Yeah, I might know Python.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18785-0
01:23:55.866 --> 01:23:57.806
You might know SWIFT or Java.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18794-0
01:23:58.166 --> 01:23:59.656
I don't know that you don't know
Python.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18801-0
01:23:59.666 --> 01:24:02.066
Then how will we communicate,
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18806-0
01:24:02.156 --> 01:24:02.996
That is one problem.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18815-0
01:24:04.006 --> 01:24:06.476
All the human beings are in
software development.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18835-0
01:24:06.846 --> 01:24:11.480
Experts need not know the same
language, that is point 1.2 is a

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18835-1
01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:12.566
normal English.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18847-0
01:24:12.836 --> 01:24:16.466
We will not be able to convey
certain important details right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18858-0
01:24:16.476 --> 01:24:19.166
For example, are you accessing
memory or not?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18873-0
01:24:19.256 --> 01:24:22.166
Those details we will not be
able to convey in plain English.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18890-0
01:24:22.676 --> 01:24:25.870
So in order to solve both these
problems, we write something

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18890-1
01:24:25.870 --> 01:24:27.126
called as a pseudo code.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18915-0
01:24:28.096 --> 01:24:30.904
So in this algorithm, if you see
we take the first element in the

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18915-1
01:24:30.904 --> 01:24:32.946
array, put it in a variable
called current Max.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18921-0
01:24:33.256 --> 01:24:34.346
Then we run a loop.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18938-0
01:24:34.576 --> 01:24:37.795
In the loop, we are comparing
each element in the array with

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18938-1
01:24:37.795 --> 01:24:39.166
this variable current Max.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18959-0
01:24:39.536 --> 01:24:42.737
If you find some element greater
than your current VMAX, you

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18959-1
01:24:42.737 --> 01:24:45.046
update your current Max with
that variable.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18982-0
01:24:45.336 --> 01:24:49.071
Once this loop is over, you will
be able to know that the maximum

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/18982-1
01:24:49.071 --> 01:24:51.956
element in that array will be
the current maximum.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19000-0
01:24:53.806 --> 01:24:58.084
Yeah, but this particular code,
if you execute in any editor, it

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19000-1
01:24:58.084 --> 01:24:59.136
will not, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19021-0
01:24:59.226 --> 01:25:01.775
So the code does require
programming language or any

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19021-1
01:25:01.775 --> 01:25:04.516
technology to be considered as
just kind of rough draft.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19029-0
01:25:04.526 --> 01:25:05.676
Yeah, it is just rough draft.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19037-0
01:25:05.766 --> 01:25:07.036
There are some rules to write
this.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19049-0
01:25:07.046 --> 01:25:09.636
Also, I will talk about that in
the next slide, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19054-0
01:25:09.646 --> 01:25:10.556
For example, this arrow.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19060-0
01:25:11.436 --> 01:25:13.366
This arrow means that
assignment.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19076-0
01:25:13.716 --> 01:25:16.649
It means whatever is in the
right side, you are assigning it

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19076-1
01:25:16.649 --> 01:25:17.466
to the left side.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19079-0
01:25:18.016 --> 01:25:20.326
That means assignment, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19100-0
01:25:20.336 --> 01:25:22.703
So like this, there are many
rules so we will learn about

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19100-1
01:25:22.703 --> 01:25:23.926
those rules in the next slide.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19120-0
01:25:24.476 --> 01:25:27.637
But real quick in this program,
initially what happens, the

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19120-1
01:25:27.637 --> 01:25:29.586
current Max will be a 0 which is
10.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19140-0
01:25:29.956 --> 01:25:33.477
Then you start a loop from here
till the end you try to see if

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19140-1
01:25:33.477 --> 01:25:34.706
20 is greater than 10.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19144-0
01:25:34.956 --> 01:25:35.406
Yes.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19153-0
01:25:35.776 --> 01:25:37.786
So this current Max line becomes
20.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19163-0
01:25:38.556 --> 01:25:39.946
Then again, you go back to the
loop.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19172-0
01:25:40.016 --> 01:25:43.046
I becomes 2:30 is greater than
20. Yes.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19201-0
01:25:43.346 --> 01:25:48.036
So you are current Max becomes
30 and then I becomes three is 5

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19201-1
01:25:48.036 --> 01:25:51.406
greater than 30, No 5 is not
greater than 30.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19214-0
01:25:51.416 --> 01:25:53.926
So this line doesn't execute you
again go back.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19218-0
01:25:53.936 --> 01:25:55.606
I becomes 4 right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19233-0
01:25:55.736 --> 01:25:58.786
That is nothing but a of I-77
greater than 30.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19236-0
01:25:59.156 --> 01:25:59.826
Is that true?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19240-0
01:25:59.836 --> 01:26:00.206
No.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19275-0
01:26:00.276 --> 01:26:04.012
So this line doesn't execute, so
you are back to the last line

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19275-1
01:26:04.012 --> 01:26:07.689
which is return current Max and
this variable has my value 30

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19275-2
01:26:07.689 --> 01:26:10.476
and 30 is of course the largest
in this array.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19292-0
01:26:11.206 --> 01:26:14.934
So does this sudocode work at
least successfully conveyed the

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19292-1
01:26:14.934 --> 01:26:16.076
idea to all of you?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19294-0
01:26:17.376 --> 01:26:17.636
Yes.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19304-0
01:26:17.646 --> 01:26:19.136
No, I have not written a
program.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19329-0
01:26:19.146 --> 01:26:22.700
This is not going to work, but
all of you now know how to find

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19329-1
01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:24.786
out the maximum element in an
array.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19338-0
01:26:25.096 --> 01:26:26.396
You know that you'll keep a
variable.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19345-0
01:26:26.406 --> 01:26:27.586
You will run a loop.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19357-0
01:26:27.656 --> 01:26:30.204
You'll try to update that
variable when you find something

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19357-1
01:26:30.204 --> 01:26:30.506
better.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19365-0
01:26:31.756 --> 01:26:34.266
Yeah, this is the pseudo code.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19368-0
01:26:34.276 --> 01:26:34.536
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19397-0
01:26:34.546 --> 01:26:37.903
So for all the newbies who have
not done any programming, I'll

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19397-1
01:26:37.903 --> 01:26:41.047
again urge you to please, you
know, put that extra effort,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19397-2
01:26:41.047 --> 01:26:41.366
right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19438-0
01:26:41.456 --> 01:26:44.576
So when these type of pseudo
code or this type is given,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19438-1
01:26:44.576 --> 01:26:47.969
you'll always try to trace this
program, meaning you'll first

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19438-2
01:26:47.969 --> 01:26:51.416
see what is current Max current
Max is a zero, what is a zero?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19441-0
01:26:53.406 --> 01:26:53.696
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19463-0
01:26:53.706 --> 01:26:57.696
Santosh will tell that Santosh
Kumar yeah, what is a zero is 0

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19463-1
01:26:57.696 --> 01:27:00.166
is the first element here which
is 10.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19481-0
01:27:00.376 --> 01:27:03.946
So this current Max is going to
have 10 and then what happens?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19500-0
01:27:04.116 --> 01:27:08.886
I is initialized to one and then
you go in a of I what is a of 1.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19540-0
01:27:08.896 --> 01:27:13.107
Now a of one is 20, so you're
comparing 20 with 10 point is

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19540-1
01:27:13.107 --> 01:27:17.459
greater than 10 is true, so you
are coming in and current Max

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19540-2
01:27:17.459 --> 01:27:20.406
now becomes 20 and Now this line
is over.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19547-0
01:27:20.416 --> 01:27:21.986
You go back to the loop, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19555-0
01:27:21.996 --> 01:27:23.206
You see the indentation right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19579-0
01:27:23.376 --> 01:27:27.321
So these two lines are the body
of the for loop, so you again go

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19579-1
01:27:27.321 --> 01:27:29.566
back and I becomes now three,
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19585-0
01:27:29.576 --> 01:27:31.826
I becomes two, so A of two.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19594-0
01:27:31.836 --> 01:27:33.726
What is a of two now a of two?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19613-0
01:27:33.736 --> 01:27:37.886
Nothing but 30 right now, 30 is
greater than 20 because current

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19613-1
01:27:37.886 --> 01:27:39.896
Max was already updated, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19639-0
01:27:40.126 --> 01:27:43.265
So this keeps happening till the
loop is over and at the end of

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19639-1
01:27:43.265 --> 01:27:45.716
the day the current Max will
have that answer 30.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19641-0
01:27:47.466 --> 01:27:47.736
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19644-0
01:27:47.746 --> 01:27:48.496
Is that clear? Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19658-0
01:27:50.906 --> 01:27:56.146
Santosh, for Sudocode also block
of statements to identify.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19660-0
01:27:56.156 --> 01:27:56.846
Not necessary.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19666-0
01:27:57.316 --> 01:27:58.646
Yeah, that was already gone.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19669-0
01:27:58.656 --> 01:27:59.746
OK, cool.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19674-0
01:27:59.996 --> 01:28:01.026
So some rules, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19689-0
01:28:01.036 --> 01:28:03.676
Someone was asking Leno how do
we write this sudo code?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19693-0
01:28:03.686 --> 01:28:04.526
Are there any rules?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19699-0
01:28:04.776 --> 01:28:05.986
Yes, right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19711-0
01:28:06.436 --> 01:28:09.366
As we saw, it is structured than
usual text.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19720-0
01:28:09.376 --> 01:28:11.026
It is not very simple like
English.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19733-0
01:28:11.116 --> 01:28:13.492
There should be some structure
to it, meaning there is some

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19733-1
01:28:13.492 --> 01:28:14.086
intention here.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19746-0
01:28:14.356 --> 01:28:17.026
There are some keywords like do
then right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19761-0
01:28:17.036 --> 01:28:20.215
It is a little structured, but
not as formal as a programming

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19761-1
01:28:20.215 --> 01:28:20.676
language.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19763-0
01:28:22.186 --> 01:28:22.836
Control flows.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19786-0
01:28:22.846 --> 01:28:27.123
You can use just like you know
if then while repeat or you can

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19786-1
01:28:27.123 --> 01:28:29.906
use this intermediation replaces
braces.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19799-0
01:28:29.916 --> 01:28:32.996
You can use that you can use
method declaration like.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19850-0
01:28:33.006 --> 01:28:36.496
This is what my program is going
to do, right and some

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19850-1
01:28:36.496 --> 01:28:40.113
expressions like these like
assignment you will do using

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19850-2
01:28:40.113 --> 01:28:44.301
arrow like this is equal to your
equal to in programming language

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19850-3
01:28:44.301 --> 01:28:46.966
right in C, Java or Python A
equal to 10.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19861-0
01:28:48.296 --> 01:28:50.906
In this you will do a this arrow
10 right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19866-0
01:28:50.916 --> 01:28:52.326
This arrow means assignment.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19893-0
01:28:52.956 --> 01:28:56.790
Here in pseudo code equal to
means equality testing right

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19893-1
01:28:56.790 --> 01:29:01.086
when you want to check for, you
know some variables are equal or

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19893-2
01:29:01.086 --> 01:29:01.746
not right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19921-0
01:29:01.856 --> 01:29:05.536
For example, if you want to know
if a is equal equal to five,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19921-1
01:29:05.536 --> 01:29:08.206
this you will do it in
programming language.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19932-0
01:29:09.226 --> 01:29:14.796
But in seudo code you can do it
as a equal to 5, correct?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19993-0
01:29:15.206 --> 01:29:18.804
Similarly, assignment in normal
languages you will do it as say

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19993-1
01:29:18.804 --> 01:29:22.009
is equal to temp whereas in
pseudo code you will do like

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19993-2
01:29:22.009 --> 01:29:25.100
this and this arrow means
assignment and this equal to

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19993-3
01:29:25.100 --> 01:29:28.698
means comparison and similarly
in any programming language will

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/19993-4
01:29:28.698 --> 01:29:31.846
you be able to directly use
these type of superscripts.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20002-0
01:29:33.776 --> 01:29:34.556
Have you ever returned?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20018-0
01:29:34.566 --> 01:29:36.926
Like you know, in a program
directly I less than N square.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20023-0
01:29:37.356 --> 01:29:38.226
You cannot do that, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20039-0
01:29:38.236 --> 01:29:41.532
You have to do N into north or
north into 2, something like

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20039-1
01:29:41.532 --> 01:29:41.806
that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20050-0
01:29:41.876 --> 01:29:43.906
But in your pseudo code, it's
liberal, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20077-0
01:29:43.916 --> 01:29:46.631
You can directly write in square
and all that because at the end

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20077-1
01:29:46.631 --> 01:29:48.426
it is just for human beings to
understand.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20086-0
01:29:48.876 --> 01:29:51.946
The purpose is not to run it on
a computer, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20097-0
01:29:51.956 --> 01:29:54.076
So we will be able to get to
know about it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20100-0
01:29:55.376 --> 01:29:55.626
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20109-0
01:29:55.636 --> 01:29:56.706
Is this clear for all of you?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20116-0
01:29:56.716 --> 01:29:57.616
What is the pseudo code?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20128-0
01:29:59.086 --> 01:30:02.129
Pseudocode is just to
communicate between human

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20128-1
01:30:02.129 --> 01:30:03.016
beings, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20140-0
01:30:03.226 --> 01:30:05.136
It is not going to run on a
computer.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20149-0
01:30:05.646 --> 01:30:07.596
It is more formal than English.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20170-0
01:30:07.886 --> 01:30:11.465
It is less formal than a
programming language and a lot

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20170-1
01:30:11.465 --> 01:30:14.596
of essence of the program can be
conveyed in it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20182-0
01:30:15.116 --> 01:30:20.276
Yeah, which is also going to
help us in evaluating our codes.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20192-0
01:30:22.526 --> 01:30:23.806
Yeah, so far so good, guys.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20194-0
01:30:23.816 --> 01:30:24.176
All of you?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20196-0
01:30:25.446 --> 01:30:25.726
Yes.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20199-0
01:30:25.736 --> 01:30:25.926
No.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20214-0
01:30:25.936 --> 01:30:31.226
Maybe we'll proceed ahead when I
do N square is it will count as.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20222-0
01:30:31.236 --> 01:30:32.496
Yeah, it will count as
operation.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20231-0
01:30:32.546 --> 01:30:33.636
Yeah, we will look at that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20239-0
01:30:33.646 --> 01:30:36.036
Now that is what is called
primitive operation.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20271-0
01:30:37.046 --> 01:30:41.375
Yeah, primitive operations are
also called as basic operations

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20271-1
01:30:41.375 --> 01:30:45.566
or they are the heart of an
algorithm and it is identifiable

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20271-2
01:30:45.566 --> 01:30:46.596
in pseudo code.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20278-0
01:30:46.656 --> 01:30:47.766
That's the good news, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20294-0
01:30:47.956 --> 01:30:50.981
Anyway, once we write the you
know code, we will be able to

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20294-1
01:30:50.981 --> 01:30:51.586
identify it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20307-0
01:30:52.296 --> 01:30:56.756
It is largely independent from
the programming language, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20330-0
01:30:57.246 --> 01:31:00.727
And it is assumed to take a
constant amount of time in the

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20330-1
01:31:00.727 --> 01:31:01.316
RAM model.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20337-0
01:31:01.326 --> 01:31:02.656
And what is that constant
amount?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20339-0
01:31:02.666 --> 01:31:03.346
You already know it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20344-0
01:31:09.166 --> 01:31:09.466
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20354-0
01:31:09.476 --> 01:31:11.046
I mean to two also you can do
Rajesh.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20357-0
01:31:11.056 --> 01:31:11.696
Yeah, no problem.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20361-0
01:31:12.126 --> 01:31:12.396
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20363-0
01:31:12.406 --> 01:31:13.076
One very good.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20370-0
01:31:13.086 --> 01:31:13.936
Yeah, one time in it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20378-0
01:31:14.476 --> 01:31:17.016
What are the examples of
primitive operations?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20387-0
01:31:17.286 --> 01:31:19.726
Yeah, evaluating an expression.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20390-0
01:31:19.926 --> 01:31:20.176
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20400-0
01:31:20.186 --> 01:31:22.556
For example, A+B, that is one
time unit.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20407-0
01:31:22.706 --> 01:31:23.886
That is a primitive operation.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20422-0
01:31:24.686 --> 01:31:28.663
Assigning a value to a variable,
primitive operation, indexing

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20422-1
01:31:28.663 --> 01:31:29.546
into an array.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20424-0
01:31:29.896 --> 01:31:30.096
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20429-0
01:31:30.106 --> 01:31:30.946
Santosh had a question.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20442-0
01:31:30.956 --> 01:31:33.286
How do I know if I'm accessing
memory or not?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20471-0
01:31:33.436 --> 01:31:37.126
Yeah, you will get to know here
if I'm using a line like a of

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20471-1
01:31:37.126 --> 01:31:39.506
zero, it means I'm going to the
memory.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20499-0
01:31:39.956 --> 01:31:44.126
I'm looking at this array a I'm
picking up this zeroth location

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20499-1
01:31:44.126 --> 01:31:47.905
value, so I'm accessing the
memory so this is a primitive

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20499-2
01:31:47.905 --> 01:31:48.556
operation.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20516-0
01:31:49.566 --> 01:31:53.192
Calling a method returning from
a method, meaning that return

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20516-1
01:31:53.192 --> 01:31:55.706
line that is a primitive
operation, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20527-0
01:31:55.896 --> 01:31:57.456
So there are a lot more
examples.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20543-0
01:31:57.466 --> 01:31:59.900
You can have a look at your
book, but what is not a

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20543-1
01:31:59.900 --> 01:32:00.836
primitive operation?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20547-0
01:32:02.076 --> 01:32:03.116
Can you come with some examples?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20558-0
01:32:05.206 --> 01:32:07.436
Primitive operation means the
basic operation right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20563-0
01:32:07.446 --> 01:32:09.096
The heart of each statement.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20570-0
01:32:09.366 --> 01:32:10.696
Yeah, looping very good.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20576-0
01:32:10.966 --> 01:32:12.776
A loop has several components,
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20580-0
01:32:12.786 --> 01:32:13.716
You have to increment.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20597-0
01:32:13.726 --> 01:32:16.417
You have to do condition
checking first time your

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20597-1
01:32:16.417 --> 01:32:17.116
initializing.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20607-0
01:32:17.466 --> 01:32:20.096
It is made up of multiple
primitive operations.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20615-0
01:32:20.246 --> 01:32:23.786
Again, sorting right, all these
are not primitive operations.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20618-0
01:32:26.986 --> 01:32:27.436
Cool.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20632-0
01:32:27.726 --> 01:32:32.189
So now can we analyze and
algorithms complexity just from

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20632-1
01:32:32.189 --> 01:32:33.266
a pseudo code?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20639-0
01:32:34.276 --> 01:32:35.386
Yes, this is possible.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20646-0
01:32:36.016 --> 01:32:38.076
So this technique is very, very
important.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20671-0
01:32:38.086 --> 01:32:42.324
That is what we are going to
learn analyzing the pseudo code

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20671-1
01:32:42.324 --> 01:32:46.700
or analyzing the time complexity
by using counting primitives,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20671-2
01:32:46.700 --> 01:32:47.116
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20677-0
01:32:47.126 --> 01:32:48.446
This is called the counting
method.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20691-0
01:32:49.296 --> 01:32:52.146
Yeah, let's go over this and
then try to do it actually.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20703-0
01:32:52.216 --> 01:32:54.806
Yeah, try to have a look at this
close.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20721-0
01:32:54.816 --> 01:32:59.091
Look at it for each line of the
pseudo code, count the number of

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20721-1
01:32:59.091 --> 01:33:00.866
primitive operations in it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20739-0
01:33:01.676 --> 01:33:04.454
Pay attention to the word
primitive, because sorting an

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20739-1
01:33:04.454 --> 01:33:06.586
array is not a primitive
operation, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20768-0
01:33:07.316 --> 01:33:11.254
Multiply this count with the
number of times this line is

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20768-1
01:33:11.254 --> 01:33:15.666
executed, some up all the lines
and you will get a final answer.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20770-0
01:33:16.446 --> 01:33:17.036
You agree to this.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20773-0
01:33:19.686 --> 01:33:19.956
Yes.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20777-0
01:33:19.966 --> 01:33:20.206
No.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20791-0
01:33:20.216 --> 01:33:23.356
Maybe all of you, but so far is
the story clear.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20799-0
01:33:24.466 --> 01:33:26.076
We are going to analyze
algorithms.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20812-0
01:33:26.146 --> 01:33:29.678
We need it because multiple
people can write a correct

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20812-1
01:33:29.678 --> 01:33:30.256
solution.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20833-0
01:33:30.746 --> 01:33:34.571
Then I want to know who's better
right Karanbir also has given me

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20833-1
01:33:34.571 --> 01:33:35.846
a correct solution in.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20851-0
01:33:35.856 --> 01:33:38.846
Simran also has given Rajesh
also has given then who's

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20851-1
01:33:38.846 --> 01:33:39.606
better, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20860-0
01:33:39.616 --> 01:33:40.806
I want to know who's better.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20868-0
01:33:40.816 --> 01:33:44.046
That is why we analyze
algorithms, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20889-0
01:33:44.136 --> 01:33:47.890
But to analyze that algorithm,
we wanted a common ground and we

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20889-1
01:33:47.890 --> 01:33:49.766
all agreed upon a common ground.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20892-0
01:33:49.856 --> 01:33:50.316
What is that?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20897-0
01:33:52.566 --> 01:33:53.596
Yeah, real quick.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20920-0
01:33:53.606 --> 01:33:57.181
What was that common ground in a
common machine is where all of

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20920-1
01:33:57.181 --> 01:33:58.856
us will analyze our algorithm.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20933-0
01:33:58.916 --> 01:34:00.546
We will not run it on our own
laptops.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20936-0
01:34:00.556 --> 01:34:01.936
Right Ram model, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20941-0
01:34:01.946 --> 01:34:02.986
Random access machine.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20943-0
01:34:03.056 --> 01:34:03.626
Perfect.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20951-0
01:34:03.796 --> 01:34:06.366
And then should we all write
programs?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20955-0
01:34:06.376 --> 01:34:06.486
No.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20960-0
01:34:07.256 --> 01:34:07.946
What did we say?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20972-0
01:34:07.956 --> 01:34:11.546
We will all write sudo codes for
whatever problem is given.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20996-0
01:34:11.556 --> 01:34:14.770
We will write a pseudo code and
we are imagining that pseudo

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/20996-1
01:34:14.770 --> 01:34:16.456
code will run on that RAM model.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21000-0
01:34:17.406 --> 01:34:18.496
Is that story clear so far?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21052-0
01:34:20.586 --> 01:34:24.907
Once this is clear that pseudo
code, you take it in hand every

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21052-1
01:34:24.907 --> 01:34:29.090
line try to inspect it and see
how many primitive operations

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21052-2
01:34:29.090 --> 01:34:32.519
are there and then try to
multiply that primitive

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21052-3
01:34:32.519 --> 01:34:36.496
operation with the number of
times that line executes and

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21052-4
01:34:36.496 --> 01:34:37.936
then Add all of that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21056-0
01:34:37.996 --> 01:34:38.746
We will see an example.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21063-0
01:34:38.756 --> 01:34:39.516
It will be even more clear.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21069-0
01:34:41.026 --> 01:34:41.856
Yeah, let's look at this.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21082-0
01:34:42.896 --> 01:34:45.466
So this is going to print the
elements of an array.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21089-0
01:34:45.596 --> 01:34:46.506
What is this code doing?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21107-0
01:34:46.516 --> 01:34:52.122
All I is equal to 0 while I is
less than N print A of I I plus

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21107-1
01:34:52.122 --> 01:34:52.566
plus.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21116-0
01:34:53.096 --> 01:34:54.746
So what is it ultimately going
to do?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21133-0
01:34:54.796 --> 01:34:57.753
It is just going to take an
array and print all of its

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21133-1
01:34:57.753 --> 01:34:58.236
elements.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21151-0
01:34:59.276 --> 01:35:02.857
Yeah, I've just written a small
piece of code right this I plus

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21151-1
01:35:02.857 --> 01:35:03.136
plus.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21163-0
01:35:03.146 --> 01:35:06.026
Also you can write it as I is
equal to I + 1.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21169-0
01:35:07.166 --> 01:35:08.136
That is the correct way.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21182-0
01:35:08.226 --> 01:35:10.626
Yeah, you need not write this is
this clear guys?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21188-0
01:35:10.636 --> 01:35:11.576
This is seudo code, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21190-0
01:35:11.586 --> 01:35:12.156
We have written it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21201-0
01:35:14.006 --> 01:35:16.826
Now we are going to analyze this
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21207-0
01:35:16.836 --> 01:35:17.816
How do you analyze this?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21216-0
01:35:17.876 --> 01:35:20.656
I have taken the same piece line
by line.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21219-0
01:35:20.986 --> 01:35:21.516
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21224-0
01:35:21.576 --> 01:35:22.336
What will be the input?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21237-0
01:35:22.346 --> 01:35:25.196
The input is already known,
which is an array with elements.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21245-0
01:35:26.186 --> 01:35:27.636
Yeah, I'm given some yen.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21260-0
01:35:27.946 --> 01:35:32.196
I'm having that actual array A
so that is what is given to us.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21266-0
01:35:32.206 --> 01:35:33.276
Yeah, it is all known.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21284-0
01:35:33.346 --> 01:35:36.461
Yeah, it is not defined because
this is audio code that then can

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21284-1
01:35:36.461 --> 01:35:37.036
be anything.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21298-0
01:35:37.046 --> 01:35:39.056
It can be fine and it means it
can be fine at elements.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21320-0
01:35:39.266 --> 01:35:42.370
I'm not bothered about it, I
just know that whatever an

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21320-1
01:35:42.370 --> 01:35:45.086
elements are given, I'm going to
print it, yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21332-0
01:35:47.406 --> 01:35:49.446
We will not know the loop
addressing the.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21344-0
01:35:49.456 --> 01:35:51.936
We will not know it, but yeah,
that is the whole beauty.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21346-0
01:35:51.946 --> 01:35:52.196
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21362-0
01:35:52.206 --> 01:35:56.283
Now you're all probing the right
questions without even knowing

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21362-1
01:35:56.283 --> 01:35:56.856
all that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21372-0
01:35:56.906 --> 01:35:59.126
I will still be able to analyze
this program.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21378-0
01:35:59.426 --> 01:36:00.376
Yeah, that is the beauty.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21383-0
01:36:00.386 --> 01:36:00.826
Let's do that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21390-0
01:36:02.656 --> 01:36:03.866
So does this little code?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21392-0
01:36:03.916 --> 01:36:04.166
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21403-0
01:36:04.176 --> 01:36:06.426
Now, how do you analyze that
using counting primitive?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21415-0
01:36:06.656 --> 01:36:09.996
We will be going line by line
the very first line.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21432-0
01:36:10.856 --> 01:36:14.374
How many times it is going to
execute and is it having any

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21432-1
01:36:14.374 --> 01:36:15.566
primitive operation?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21436-0
01:36:15.876 --> 01:36:16.466
Yeah, all of you.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21442-0
01:36:16.476 --> 01:36:17.586
Please don't jump the bridge.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21452-0
01:36:17.596 --> 01:36:20.026
Yeah, it'll be very intimidating
for others.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21464-0
01:36:20.476 --> 01:36:24.206
Yeah, we'll go line by line in
the first line.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21469-0
01:36:24.216 --> 01:36:25.546
Is there any primitive
operation?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21475-0
01:36:26.296 --> 01:36:27.596
What is that primitive
operation?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21479-0
01:36:29.026 --> 01:36:29.186
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21487-0
01:36:30.266 --> 01:36:32.156
We are going to assign that zero
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21496-0
01:36:32.266 --> 01:36:34.516
So this is technically not a
pseudo code.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21501-0
01:36:34.526 --> 01:36:35.356
Yeah, this is semi.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21512-0
01:36:35.366 --> 01:36:36.876
Yeah, you should have it like an
arrow, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21537-0
01:36:37.226 --> 01:36:41.077
So this is going to do 1 unit,
right, one initialization of Y,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21537-1
01:36:41.077 --> 01:36:43.766
only one time it is going to
happen, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21558-0
01:36:43.776 --> 01:36:47.385
Every time I is not going to get
assigned, so only one time and

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21558-1
01:36:47.385 --> 01:36:49.076
then there is this while loop.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21570-0
01:36:50.106 --> 01:36:52.826
How many times will this while
loop execute?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21584-0
01:36:52.896 --> 01:36:55.646
That is my Western inside that
there is a operator.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21607-0
01:36:55.696 --> 01:36:58.872
This is a comparison operator
which is going to take one unit

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21607-1
01:36:58.872 --> 01:37:01.176
of time, but how many times will
it execute?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21615-0
01:37:02.266 --> 01:37:03.666
Yeah, we don't need syntax
Surendran.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21624-0
01:37:03.676 --> 01:37:05.346
Yeah, you can just put it
normally.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21628-0
01:37:05.356 --> 01:37:07.056
Also no problem, yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21637-0
01:37:09.786 --> 01:37:11.596
Yen plus one, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21657-0
01:37:11.606 --> 01:37:15.433
If you clearly see the last time
also the comparison will happen,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21657-1
01:37:15.433 --> 01:37:18.216
but then the comparison will
fail at that time.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21659-0
01:37:18.926 --> 01:37:19.376
Correct.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21668-0
01:37:19.926 --> 01:37:21.776
So N + 1 number of times.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21678-0
01:37:21.846 --> 01:37:23.446
What about the body of these two
lines?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21708-0
01:37:24.946 --> 01:37:28.982
Yeah, if this is N + 1, the last
plus one time the Bloop will

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21708-1
01:37:28.982 --> 01:37:32.886
fail and come out, so the body
will execute N times, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21721-0
01:37:33.136 --> 01:37:37.256
But look at this line in this
particular print line.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21727-0
01:37:37.586 --> 01:37:38.876
What are the primitive
operations?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21738-0
01:37:41.236 --> 01:37:44.246
Yeah, let's try to identify the
primitive operation.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21742-0
01:37:44.256 --> 01:37:44.736
What are those?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21759-0
01:37:46.266 --> 01:37:50.096
Yeah, indexing correct a of I is
nothing but indexing.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21763-0
01:37:50.106 --> 01:37:51.336
That is 1 primitive operation.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21768-0
01:37:51.346 --> 01:37:52.006
What else is there?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21775-0
01:37:52.946 --> 01:37:53.876
Yeah, you identified.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21781-0
01:37:53.886 --> 01:37:54.396
You got it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21788-0
01:37:54.406 --> 01:37:57.036
Then you're printing it right
print.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21795-0
01:37:57.346 --> 01:37:59.096
So this is also a primitive
operation, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21804-0
01:37:59.206 --> 01:38:02.326
So there are two primitive
operations, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21815-0
01:38:02.506 --> 01:38:05.936
So N array indexing operations
are there, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21847-0
01:38:05.946 --> 01:38:09.781
And every time that line
executes, there are two

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21847-1
01:38:09.781 --> 01:38:14.397
primitive operations that is
happening right that is north

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21847-2
01:38:14.397 --> 01:38:18.466
invocation of print right and
then increments of I.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21849-0
01:38:19.396 --> 01:38:19.596
Right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21863-0
01:38:20.356 --> 01:38:23.166
So we just try to Add all of
that and we will.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21902-0
01:38:23.176 --> 01:38:26.328
So for the time being, don't
worry about this small, you

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21902-1
01:38:26.328 --> 01:38:29.702
know, plus 1 -, 1 and all that
in a couple of slides we will

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21902-2
01:38:29.702 --> 01:38:32.632
look at the, you know,
significance that they're all

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21902-3
01:38:32.632 --> 01:38:33.406
not important.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21908-0
01:38:34.216 --> 01:38:35.346
Yeah, don't worry about that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21918-0
01:38:35.516 --> 01:38:36.656
Please do this for another
program.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21928-0
01:38:38.136 --> 01:38:39.626
I love to do it in a tabular
way.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21936-0
01:38:39.696 --> 01:38:41.206
You can also prefer to do this
way.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21938-0
01:38:41.656 --> 01:38:41.866
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21949-0
01:38:41.876 --> 01:38:43.396
First, let's look at what this
is doing.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21985-0
01:38:44.476 --> 01:38:48.218
The first column I'm writing the
actual pseudo code in the second

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21985-1
01:38:48.218 --> 01:38:51.789
column I'm counting the number
of primitive operations in that

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/21985-2
01:38:51.789 --> 01:38:54.906
line, and in the third column
I'm giving some remarks.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22001-0
01:38:56.246 --> 01:38:59.219
First things first, if you look
at this first column, what is it

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22001-1
01:38:59.219 --> 01:38:59.996
that it is doing?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22020-0
01:39:01.606 --> 01:39:06.166
Arrison it is taking an array as
input with N elements.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22032-0
01:39:06.666 --> 01:39:09.516
It is going to Add all the
elements in that array.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22039-0
01:39:09.926 --> 01:39:10.756
That is what it is.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22053-0
01:39:10.816 --> 01:39:13.636
It is going to do is the code
self explanatory?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22062-0
01:39:14.966 --> 01:39:16.496
I've taken the first element in
some.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22065-0
01:39:16.546 --> 01:39:17.576
I have a variable.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22077-0
01:39:17.666 --> 01:39:19.646
Uh, you know, I I run a while
loop.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22098-0
01:39:20.526 --> 01:39:24.268
I add each element with the sum
variable and store it in some

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22098-1
01:39:24.268 --> 01:39:25.776
itself and I increment I.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22128-0
01:39:25.856 --> 01:39:29.390
I'll keep doing this while loop,
third step and when the while

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22128-1
01:39:29.390 --> 01:39:32.867
loop fails, I'll come back and
my sum will have the total sum

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22128-2
01:39:32.867 --> 01:39:33.596
of the array.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22131-0
01:39:33.866 --> 01:39:34.596
I'll return it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22148-0
01:39:35.706 --> 01:39:39.667
Yeah, is the first column clear
for all of you real quick guys,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22148-1
01:39:39.667 --> 01:39:39.976
yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22158-0
01:39:42.896 --> 01:39:43.726
Now what is the next step?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22168-0
01:39:44.586 --> 01:39:45.816
You have returned the code.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22173-0
01:39:45.976 --> 01:39:47.466
The next step is to analyze it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22180-0
01:39:47.476 --> 01:39:48.206
How do you analyze it?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22198-0
01:39:48.976 --> 01:39:52.457
People use the counting
primitive method and this is

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22198-1
01:39:52.457 --> 01:39:54.886
going to assume the RAM model
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22211-0
01:39:54.896 --> 01:39:59.056
This pseudo code is going to run
on the RAM machine, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22220-0
01:40:00.686 --> 01:40:02.106
Let's apply the counting
primitive.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22231-0
01:40:02.796 --> 01:40:05.886
So in the first line, how many
primitive operations are there?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22240-0
01:40:06.176 --> 01:40:07.966
There are two right there.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22244-0
01:40:07.976 --> 01:40:09.386
Is this indexing there?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22260-0
01:40:09.396 --> 01:40:11.766
Is this assignment so that is
what I have given as a comment.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22269-0
01:40:12.116 --> 01:40:14.606
Indexing is also happening,
meaning a zero.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22288-0
01:40:14.616 --> 01:40:17.536
I go to that memory and take
that element that is indexing

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22288-1
01:40:17.536 --> 01:40:19.466
and then assignment is also
happening.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22290-0
01:40:20.806 --> 01:40:21.256
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22321-0
01:40:21.306 --> 01:40:24.308
So in a lot of uh, you know, use
cases, people instead of writing

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22321-1
01:40:24.308 --> 01:40:26.991
that, you know this type of
arrow people put equal to also

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22321-2
01:40:26.991 --> 01:40:27.536
it is known.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22349-0
01:40:27.546 --> 01:40:30.175
Yeah, nobody's going to, you
know, tell that it is wrong and

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22349-1
01:40:30.175 --> 01:40:32.716
so on, because there's just to
communicate between humans.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22356-0
01:40:32.726 --> 01:40:34.616
Yeah, it is still fine, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22373-0
01:40:34.766 --> 01:40:39.518
So I have assigned it I equal to
1 only one operation assignment

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22373-1
01:40:39.518 --> 01:40:39.956
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22382-0
01:40:39.966 --> 01:40:42.186
And these lines are going to
execute only once, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22390-0
01:40:43.546 --> 01:40:44.546
What about this one?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22407-0
01:40:44.896 --> 01:40:48.375
I list Danian how many
comparisons are going to happen

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22407-1
01:40:48.375 --> 01:40:49.956
in while loop while here?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22419-0
01:40:49.966 --> 01:40:51.516
Yeah, there also that is what I
was telling.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22424-0
01:40:51.526 --> 01:40:52.386
Don't worry about that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22446-0
01:40:52.396 --> 01:40:55.596
Plus 1 -, 1, because in a couple
of slides you will realize that

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22446-1
01:40:55.596 --> 01:40:56.876
none of that is important.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22456-0
01:40:57.206 --> 01:40:58.686
We are going to anyway delete
all of that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22469-0
01:40:59.546 --> 01:41:01.796
Yeah, even if you want, you can
put that. No problem.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22471-0
01:41:01.846 --> 01:41:01.946
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22489-0
01:41:03.576 --> 01:41:07.336
So I less than N how many times
this line is going to execute?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22516-0
01:41:08.426 --> 01:41:12.001
I suppose my eyes 5 right
initially for is equal to 180

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22516-1
01:41:12.001 --> 01:41:13.916
execute for two it'll execute.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22529-0
01:41:13.926 --> 01:41:15.856
For three, it execute for four
at execute for.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22536-0
01:41:15.866 --> 01:41:19.096
If I execute I will become six,
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22553-0
01:41:20.266 --> 01:41:23.456
But here if you see is less than
yen, right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22570-0
01:41:23.466 --> 01:41:29.079
If N was five, how many times
will it execute for 1234 for

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22570-1
01:41:29.079 --> 01:41:30.506
this statement?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22583-0
01:41:30.516 --> 01:41:32.636
What will it become by less than
five?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22591-0
01:41:33.386 --> 01:41:35.736
That line still executed right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22606-0
01:41:36.126 --> 01:41:39.308
That line still executed, but it
became false and then we came

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22606-1
01:41:39.308 --> 01:41:40.116
out of the loop.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22617-0
01:41:40.206 --> 01:41:42.656
So how many times did it execute
it?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22625-0
01:41:42.666 --> 01:41:44.586
Execute the end times or N + 1
times.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22627-0
01:41:46.816 --> 01:41:46.996
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22643-0
01:41:49.226 --> 01:41:51.666
Yes, you can use either this
arrow or you can put equal to.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22649-0
01:41:51.676 --> 01:41:52.856
Also, it is not a problem.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22656-0
01:41:52.906 --> 01:41:53.916
Yeah, both are accepted.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22685-0
01:41:54.046 --> 01:41:58.232
So and times only, it executes
if this operation was I less

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22685-1
01:41:58.232 --> 01:42:02.348
than or equal to yen right then
it will be N + 1 number of

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22685-2
01:42:02.348 --> 01:42:02.766
times.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22696-0
01:42:03.776 --> 01:42:05.426
Yeah, always trace it, no
problem.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22711-0
01:42:05.496 --> 01:42:08.075
But in a couple of slides,
you'll realize all this is not

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22711-1
01:42:08.075 --> 01:42:08.386
needed.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22720-0
01:42:08.396 --> 01:42:09.566
Yeah, so it's fine.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22729-0
01:42:10.256 --> 01:42:12.566
If this is, then what is the
body of the loop?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22765-0
01:42:12.716 --> 01:42:16.187
It will be and minus One North
minus one times it will execute,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22765-1
01:42:16.187 --> 01:42:19.223
but how many operations are
there in this line there is

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22765-2
01:42:19.223 --> 01:42:20.036
array indexing.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22768-0
01:42:20.466 --> 01:42:21.636
There is addition.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22788-0
01:42:21.906 --> 01:42:25.727
There is assignment, so three
operations are there and minus

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22788-1
01:42:25.727 --> 01:42:26.916
one times indexing.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22797-0
01:42:26.926 --> 01:42:28.696
Is there addition is there
assignment?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22840-0
01:42:28.706 --> 01:42:31.960
Is there similarly here there
are two operations addition is

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22840-1
01:42:31.960 --> 01:42:35.213
there assignment is there so two
operations and then finally

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22840-2
01:42:35.213 --> 01:42:38.360
there is this only one time
you're returning and that line

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22840-3
01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:39.426
is outside the loop.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22850-0
01:42:39.476 --> 01:42:40.996
So only once it is going to
execute.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22869-0
01:42:42.706 --> 01:42:47.177
So now can I submit the second
column and plus one the other is

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22869-1
01:42:47.177 --> 01:42:47.596
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22876-0
01:42:47.666 --> 01:42:48.906
Yeah, Chandramouli bang on.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22899-0
01:42:49.626 --> 01:42:52.994
I'll just, you know, add this
complete second column and I

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22899-1
01:42:52.994 --> 01:42:55.676
will get an answer so far is
this story clear?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22922-0
01:42:57.366 --> 01:43:01.683
Whatever I program I give you,
you will first write a pseudo

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22922-1
01:43:01.683 --> 01:43:04.726
code and then every line you
will inspect.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22945-0
01:43:05.036 --> 01:43:08.221
You will try to see how many
primitive operations it is

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22945-1
01:43:08.221 --> 01:43:11.746
having, and then you'll also be
a little careful about loops.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22965-0
01:43:11.756 --> 01:43:15.377
How many times it executes
finally that whole column you

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22965-1
01:43:15.377 --> 01:43:17.536
will submit it and keep it,
yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22971-0
01:43:19.396 --> 01:43:20.186
So far so good.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22973-0
01:43:20.476 --> 01:43:21.166
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22983-0
01:43:21.336 --> 01:43:23.106
Can you please repeat the North
minus one logic?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/22991-0
01:43:23.116 --> 01:43:24.366
Yeah, so simple statements.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23016-0
01:43:24.376 --> 01:43:29.398
And then if the actual loop line
executes the end times, the body

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23016-1
01:43:29.398 --> 01:43:33.506
of it right will execute N minus
one number of times.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23045-0
01:43:34.116 --> 01:43:38.432
If the actual loop line executes
N + 1 number of times, the body

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23045-1
01:43:38.432 --> 01:43:42.416
of it will execute the end
times, right one less than that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23047-0
01:43:42.426 --> 01:43:42.866
That is it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23058-0
01:43:44.006 --> 01:43:45.976
There's a while statement by
itself is not primitive.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23061-0
01:43:45.986 --> 01:43:46.556
No, it is not.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23068-0
01:43:46.566 --> 01:43:47.796
It is a keyword, yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23088-0
01:43:47.806 --> 01:43:50.509
So the compiler knows that
there's a loop, so it is not a

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23088-1
01:43:50.509 --> 01:43:51.906
primitive operation in itself.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23098-0
01:43:53.686 --> 01:43:56.536
Cool, but don't don't worry too
much about it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23107-0
01:43:56.546 --> 01:43:57.966
You will remember this in a
while.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23117-0
01:43:58.236 --> 01:43:59.366
So so far it is good.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23127-0
01:43:59.456 --> 01:44:02.786
You try to get something like
this at the end, yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23142-0
01:44:04.866 --> 01:44:08.279
Now let's proceed ahead and
let's talk about something

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23142-1
01:44:08.279 --> 01:44:09.706
called as running time.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23152-0
01:44:10.486 --> 01:44:11.976
Yeah, but iteration depends on.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23164-0
01:44:11.986 --> 01:44:14.816
I correct it all dependent on I
only yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23180-0
01:44:16.096 --> 01:44:18.466
Why we are competing it as n -,
1 did not understand.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23186-0
01:44:18.476 --> 01:44:20.106
Yeah, condition is not
satisfying, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23219-0
01:44:20.296 --> 01:44:23.621
So for you, I will try to, you
know, take some values, take a

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23219-1
01:44:23.621 --> 01:44:26.945
value of I take a value of yen
and try to trace that program.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23219-2
01:44:26.945 --> 01:44:27.266
Right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23233-0
01:44:27.276 --> 01:44:30.736
Say suppose I want to print and
my end value is 3, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23248-0
01:44:30.746 --> 01:44:33.756
I have a condition I less than
yen.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23273-0
01:44:34.086 --> 01:44:37.496
So initially I is equal to 1,
one less than three is true, so

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23273-1
01:44:37.496 --> 01:44:40.246
it will execute the body, it'll
execute the body.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23288-0
01:44:41.346 --> 01:44:44.896
Are you becomes 22 less than
three is true.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23296-0
01:44:45.016 --> 01:44:45.966
It'll execute the body.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23307-0
01:44:46.766 --> 01:44:49.916
It becomes three book 3 less
than three.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23320-0
01:44:49.996 --> 01:44:53.806
This line executed right, but it
gave me an answer as false.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23326-0
01:44:54.046 --> 01:44:56.736
So this body is not executed
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23333-0
01:44:56.966 --> 01:44:58.406
So that condition line.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23340-0
01:44:58.416 --> 01:44:59.736
How many times did it execute?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23353-0
01:45:00.026 --> 01:45:04.656
So if you see here once, twice,
thrice, it executed that line.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23380-0
01:45:04.886 --> 01:45:08.587
So it executed number of times,
so three times that line

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23380-1
01:45:08.587 --> 01:45:12.353
executed whereas whatever is
there in the body of it this

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23380-2
01:45:12.353 --> 01:45:13.456
time it executed.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23392-0
01:45:13.466 --> 01:45:15.728
Here it executed but here it
failed because this condition

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23392-1
01:45:15.728 --> 01:45:15.996
failed.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23405-0
01:45:16.006 --> 01:45:18.836
I didn't execute the body, so
only two times it executed.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23414-0
01:45:18.906 --> 01:45:20.246
So 2 is what N minus one.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23423-0
01:45:21.066 --> 01:45:22.136
That is what I was telling.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23452-0
01:45:22.446 --> 01:45:26.390
If I less than North is the
condition then this condition

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23452-1
01:45:26.390 --> 01:45:30.469
line will execute N times and
it's body will execute n -, 1

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23452-2
01:45:30.469 --> 01:45:31.556
number of times.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23455-0
01:45:33.006 --> 01:45:33.616
Was that clear?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23461-0
01:45:33.626 --> 01:45:35.516
Alita Hall of you, yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23479-0
01:45:40.056 --> 01:45:41.956
If it is less than or equal to,
then it will change.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23495-0
01:45:41.966 --> 01:45:45.015
The third one will also execute
the next time I would have

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23495-1
01:45:45.015 --> 01:45:45.996
become four, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23527-0
01:45:46.006 --> 01:45:49.112
That line would have got
executed 4 less than three will

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23527-1
01:45:49.112 --> 01:45:52.544
still execute this line and then
it would have given false, so

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23527-2
01:45:52.544 --> 01:45:53.906
body will not execute so.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23547-0
01:45:53.916 --> 01:45:57.610
But this line still executed, so
n + 1 number of times that

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23547-1
01:45:57.610 --> 01:46:00.996
condition executed, whereas the
body executed N times.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23559-0
01:46:03.356 --> 01:46:06.466
Yeah, but yeah, don't worry too
much about it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23601-0
01:46:06.476 --> 01:46:09.594
That is what I'm again and again
trying to tell you will learn in

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23601-1
01:46:09.594 --> 01:46:12.429
a couple of slides that it is
not, you know, important that

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23601-2
01:46:12.429 --> 01:46:14.696
one line 1 + 1 -, 1, all that
will get removed.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23607-0
01:46:14.946 --> 01:46:16.016
Yeah, don't worry about that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23627-0
01:46:16.486 --> 01:46:19.932
But so far so good and the right
way to do that is to actually

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23627-1
01:46:19.932 --> 01:46:20.916
trace the program.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23644-0
01:46:21.006 --> 01:46:24.176
Take some value of N and try to
count it like how it did.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23658-0
01:46:24.186 --> 01:46:27.386
Now, yeah, try to count it and
see how many times it executes.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23666-0
01:46:29.116 --> 01:46:30.056
Yeah, so far, so good.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23668-0
01:46:30.066 --> 01:46:30.466
All of you?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23670-0
01:46:32.306 --> 01:46:32.616
Yes.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23672-0
01:46:32.626 --> 01:46:32.996
No, maybe.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23688-0
01:46:35.756 --> 01:46:37.986
I plus PLUS would be return as I
equal to I + 1.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23693-0
01:46:38.196 --> 01:46:38.656
That's right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23708-0
01:46:39.346 --> 01:46:41.996
Yeah, you have to expand it and
right treat it as two lines.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23717-0
01:46:42.326 --> 01:46:43.866
One is my addition, one is
assignment.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23725-0
01:46:45.336 --> 01:46:47.206
OK, let's talk about this
running time.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23733-0
01:46:47.636 --> 01:46:51.156
Yeah, let's take some real time
situation. Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23741-0
01:46:51.236 --> 01:46:52.376
So you're going to a library?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23772-0
01:46:52.666 --> 01:46:56.566
Yeah, you have some book already
in mind and you want that in the

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23772-1
01:46:56.566 --> 01:47:00.406
library you're stepping into the
library the moment you step in.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23782-0
01:47:00.476 --> 01:47:02.396
The first table has the book
that you were thinking.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23790-0
01:47:03.426 --> 01:47:05.006
Did you do any hard work there?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23794-0
01:47:06.466 --> 01:47:06.956
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23812-0
01:47:07.226 --> 01:47:09.639
The moment you return, you saw
the book you directly took it in

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23812-1
01:47:09.639 --> 01:47:10.016
your hand.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23835-0
01:47:10.506 --> 01:47:13.162
To the best case, that was the
best thing that had to happen

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23835-1
01:47:13.162 --> 01:47:14.686
that day, and it happened for
you.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23841-0
01:47:15.736 --> 01:47:16.626
That is 1 case.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23870-0
01:47:17.196 --> 01:47:21.867
The second case is you go to the
library, you start looking for

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23870-1
01:47:21.867 --> 01:47:26.464
the book, you start searching
every rack you search for like 5

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23870-2
01:47:26.464 --> 01:47:27.266
to 6 hours.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23887-0
01:47:27.276 --> 01:47:29.758
The whole library you have
searched then you realize that

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23887-1
01:47:29.758 --> 01:47:31.426
book is not even there in the
library.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23902-0
01:47:33.216 --> 01:47:35.511
Yeah, this is the worst case
that could happen, and that is

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23902-1
01:47:35.511 --> 01:47:36.046
what happened.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23919-0
01:47:36.876 --> 01:47:39.910
Meaning you did all the hard
work, but they did not give you

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23919-1
01:47:39.910 --> 01:47:40.506
any benefit.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23921-0
01:47:40.986 --> 01:47:41.216
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23926-0
01:47:41.226 --> 01:47:41.696
Is that correct?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23932-0
01:47:43.006 --> 01:47:45.196
That is the worst case, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23949-0
01:47:45.746 --> 01:47:48.416
And then there is it average
case where the book is lying

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23949-1
01:47:48.416 --> 01:47:48.876
somewhere.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23964-0
01:47:48.886 --> 01:47:51.701
You do some hardware, then you
try to find that book somewhere

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23964-1
01:47:51.701 --> 01:47:52.326
in the middle.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23968-0
01:47:53.706 --> 01:47:53.866
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23984-0
01:47:55.046 --> 01:47:59.696
Similarly for any problem there
are these three cases.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23999-0
01:48:00.236 --> 01:48:05.100
One is an average case, one is
the best case, one is the first

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/23999-1
01:48:05.100 --> 01:48:06.026
case, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24003-0
01:48:06.556 --> 01:48:07.566
So which is the?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24011-0
01:48:09.416 --> 01:48:11.006
One that we want to analyze.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24019-0
01:48:11.076 --> 01:48:12.056
What is your take on it?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24023-0
01:48:13.776 --> 01:48:13.996
Right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24060-0
01:48:14.006 --> 01:48:17.234
For example, in some inputs this
program is having best case like

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24060-1
01:48:17.234 --> 01:48:19.826
only in you know two
milliseconds it completed worst

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24060-2
01:48:19.826 --> 01:48:22.906
case it is completing and five
millisecond not more than that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24073-0
01:48:23.236 --> 01:48:25.836
In some average cases it is
taking 4 millisecond and so on.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24082-0
01:48:26.606 --> 01:48:27.676
Now some people are telling
words.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24094-0
01:48:27.686 --> 01:48:29.396
Some people are telling were,
you know, have and so on.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24098-0
01:48:29.406 --> 01:48:30.246
So let me know.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24106-0
01:48:30.486 --> 01:48:33.276
Try to give you some pointers
there.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24117-0
01:48:33.766 --> 01:48:36.266
Yeah, Sakshi is going to prepare
for a marathon.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24137-0
01:48:37.206 --> 01:48:40.105
Yeah, she's going to participate
in upcoming, you know, marathon

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24137-1
01:48:40.105 --> 01:48:40.996
race in the company.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24141-0
01:48:41.126 --> 01:48:42.086
She's preparing for it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24163-0
01:48:42.986 --> 01:48:46.867
What she does is when all of us
are practicing in the ground,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24163-1
01:48:46.867 --> 01:48:48.056
she goes to a hill.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24188-0
01:48:49.006 --> 01:48:54.417
She's practicing in an uphill in
the uphill if she is performing

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24188-1
01:48:54.417 --> 01:48:57.746
OK then will she do good in the
ground?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24191-0
01:48:59.376 --> 01:48:59.616
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24197-0
01:48:59.626 --> 01:49:00.516
What is your take on it?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24205-0
01:49:01.996 --> 01:49:02.176
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24232-0
01:49:03.206 --> 01:49:06.612
If she's preparing herself in
the worst case, even in a hill,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24232-1
01:49:06.612 --> 01:49:09.907
if she's practicing in the
normal ground, definitely she'll

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24232-2
01:49:09.907 --> 01:49:10.236
do it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24246-0
01:49:11.916 --> 01:49:15.137
If you are preparing for my
question paper, then everyone's

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24246-1
01:49:15.137 --> 01:49:16.156
else paper is easy.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24260-0
01:49:17.166 --> 01:49:21.270
Meaning, if you prepare for the
worst, then everything else is

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24260-1
01:49:21.270 --> 01:49:21.726
better.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24273-0
01:49:22.456 --> 01:49:25.242
Or maybe even better, I'll give
you, you know, real life

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24273-1
01:49:25.242 --> 01:49:25.926
example, yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24284-0
01:49:27.896 --> 01:49:30.326
In your best day you are sweet.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24291-0
01:49:30.416 --> 01:49:31.036
Do you agree to that?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24300-0
01:49:32.206 --> 01:49:33.456
You're you're having a good day.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24305-0
01:49:33.466 --> 01:49:34.346
All of you are very happy.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24313-0
01:49:35.226 --> 01:49:36.336
Not in your best day.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24319-0
01:49:36.386 --> 01:49:37.576
You are all previously happy.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24337-0
01:49:38.046 --> 01:49:42.207
Yeah, in your worst days, when I
want to know about your true

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24337-1
01:49:42.207 --> 01:49:42.676
nature.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24359-0
01:49:43.576 --> 01:49:47.165
Yeah, maybe your siblings,
parents, spouse, they will know

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24359-1
01:49:47.165 --> 01:49:49.476
about that right in your worst
today.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24365-0
01:49:49.526 --> 01:49:50.186
How are you behaving?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24374-0
01:49:50.986 --> 01:49:52.876
Yeah, in your worst today.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24392-0
01:49:52.886 --> 01:49:55.592
Also, if you are OK, you are
not, you know, out of your

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24392-1
01:49:55.592 --> 01:49:56.896
control, you're doing good.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24395-0
01:49:56.906 --> 01:49:57.426
You're not?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24398-0
01:49:57.486 --> 01:49:58.056
No.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24406-0
01:49:58.226 --> 01:50:00.026
Then I will treat it as good.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24415-0
01:50:00.856 --> 01:50:02.546
Same with the case of
algorithms.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24424-0
01:50:02.916 --> 01:50:04.486
I don't want to know his best.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24440-0
01:50:04.496 --> 01:50:09.026
Today I want to know his worst
today in the worst possible

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24440-1
01:50:09.026 --> 01:50:09.486
input.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24482-0
01:50:10.446 --> 01:50:14.755
When I give input N which is as
equivalent to almost Infinity,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24482-1
01:50:14.755 --> 01:50:18.653
right when I'm giving a very,
very large input, when I'm

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24482-2
01:50:18.653 --> 01:50:21.456
giving all worst things possible
to him.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24528-0
01:50:21.746 --> 01:50:26.001
In that case, how is he behaving
in that only I will compare the

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24528-1
01:50:26.001 --> 01:50:29.601
algorithms, meaning I will
compare two people on their

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24528-2
01:50:29.601 --> 01:50:33.725
worst days, not on their best
today in best day anyway, all of

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24528-3
01:50:33.725 --> 01:50:35.426
them are going to be good.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24531-0
01:50:36.216 --> 01:50:36.506
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24537-0
01:50:36.516 --> 01:50:37.546
Is it making sense, guys?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24556-0
01:50:37.556 --> 01:50:43.038
Yeah, I mean just cooking this
up or is it seeming, you know,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24556-1
01:50:43.038 --> 01:50:44.806
making sense, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24573-0
01:50:45.306 --> 01:50:48.286
And algorithm may run faster on
certain datasets than on others.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24580-0
01:50:48.636 --> 01:50:50.866
Average case is often difficult
to determine.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24588-0
01:50:50.876 --> 01:50:52.206
You may tell average case is
good.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24596-0
01:50:52.216 --> 01:50:53.526
Why not go with average?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24611-0
01:50:54.076 --> 01:50:58.319
Because average is difficult to
calculate, average depends on a

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24611-1
01:50:58.319 --> 01:50:59.446
lot of use cases.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24626-0
01:50:59.456 --> 01:51:02.106
It involves some probabilistic
modeling and so on.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24632-0
01:51:02.356 --> 01:51:03.406
So we will not go.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24649-0
01:51:03.776 --> 01:51:08.845
So our best bet is actually to
go with worst case in the worst

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24649-1
01:51:08.845 --> 01:51:09.166
day.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24675-0
01:51:09.176 --> 01:51:12.837
How are these guys performing
right and performing well in

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24675-1
01:51:12.837 --> 01:51:16.622
worst case simply means they
will perform good in the normal

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24675-2
01:51:16.622 --> 01:51:17.676
input also right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24681-0
01:51:18.656 --> 01:51:20.146
So let's take some examples.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24690-0
01:51:20.156 --> 01:51:21.746
And uh, it will be even more
clear.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24702-0
01:51:21.896 --> 01:51:25.459
Yeah, there is the small
algorithm that is doing

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24702-1
01:51:25.459 --> 01:51:26.186
something.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24713-0
01:51:26.456 --> 01:51:28.626
It is going to take two
variables A&amp;B.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24723-0
01:51:28.696 --> 01:51:30.786
It is going to add it. Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24735-0
01:51:32.056 --> 01:51:34.386
What is the time taken for this?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24740-0
01:51:35.506 --> 01:51:35.956
The same.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24749-0
01:51:35.966 --> 01:51:37.256
You know you have written a
pseudo code.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24755-0
01:51:37.266 --> 01:51:38.976
Now you'll do your primitive
operation.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24763-0
01:51:39.286 --> 01:51:40.086
What are you going to do?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24768-0
01:51:41.106 --> 01:51:42.156
Very careful guys.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24773-0
01:51:42.246 --> 01:51:43.386
This line, what does it have?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24788-0
01:51:45.666 --> 01:51:49.056
Yeah, A+B is addition and then
returning.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24790-0
01:51:49.066 --> 01:51:49.656
That's alright.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24805-0
01:51:49.666 --> 01:51:51.716
How come three Gopi only two are
here now.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24814-0
01:51:52.876 --> 01:51:54.586
Audition is 1 primitive
operation.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24843-0
01:51:54.666 --> 01:51:57.795
Returning is another primitive
operation brackets, header and

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24843-1
01:51:57.795 --> 01:52:01.024
all is not counted, so only two
right no method calling and all

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24843-2
01:52:01.024 --> 01:52:02.386
is not cool method calling.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24849-0
01:52:02.396 --> 01:52:03.246
I have not called here.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24851-0
01:52:03.256 --> 01:52:03.466
No.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24857-0
01:52:03.516 --> 01:52:04.486
Where have we called that?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24867-0
01:52:04.876 --> 01:52:06.546
This is just a function
definition.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24879-0
01:52:06.736 --> 01:52:09.436
I have not called it anywhere
with some number like this.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24883-0
01:52:10.286 --> 01:52:10.916
I have not done that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24892-0
01:52:13.556 --> 01:52:15.366
Correct only about this.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24915-0
01:52:15.376 --> 01:52:20.015
We are talking and it is 2 and
this is called a constant time

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24915-1
01:52:20.015 --> 01:52:23.306
taking algorithm which is our
favorite way.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24921-0
01:52:23.996 --> 01:52:25.486
Why is this our favorite?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24929-0
01:52:26.756 --> 01:52:28.706
Yeah, a lot of students don't
understand this.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24940-0
01:52:28.716 --> 01:52:30.956
Try to make sense out of this is
very important.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24969-0
01:52:31.986 --> 01:52:36.636
This is a constant time taking
algorithm, meaning regardless of

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24969-1
01:52:36.636 --> 01:52:41.067
my A, this is regardless of my
B, this will always take only

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24969-2
01:52:41.067 --> 01:52:42.156
two time units.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24985-0
01:52:43.176 --> 01:52:48.844
Do you agree my A's value 10 B's
value 100 Homer to the time

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24985-1
01:52:48.844 --> 01:52:49.866
complexity?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24996-0
01:52:51.596 --> 01:52:53.276
How many units of time will it
take?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/24999-0
01:52:53.286 --> 01:52:54.346
That unit is fine.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25006-0
01:52:54.356 --> 01:52:55.766
It is microsecond millisecond.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25023-0
01:52:55.776 --> 01:52:56.526
We are not bothered.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25030-0
01:52:56.536 --> 01:53:02.942
Time units 2 units now my A
oops, my is a very big number

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25030-1
01:53:02.942 --> 01:53:04.046
like this.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25039-0
01:53:05.106 --> 01:53:08.056
And my bee is also a big number
like this.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25045-0
01:53:08.126 --> 01:53:09.596
Still, what is the complexity?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25065-0
01:53:11.506 --> 01:53:17.627
Yeah, still it is 2 because this
partition algorithm is constant

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25065-1
01:53:17.627 --> 01:53:18.756
time taking.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25071-0
01:53:19.126 --> 01:53:20.636
Adding this one, returning this
one.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25077-0
01:53:20.646 --> 01:53:21.016
That's all.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25111-0
01:53:21.966 --> 01:53:26.336
Such algorithms are very good
because irrespective of your

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25111-1
01:53:26.336 --> 01:53:30.483
input, you're always going to
take the same time units,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25111-2
01:53:30.483 --> 01:53:34.704
whereas if you have some other,
something like a list of

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25111-3
01:53:34.704 --> 01:53:35.296
numbers.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25136-0
01:53:35.466 --> 01:53:39.324
If you want to Add all the
numbers in a list, yeah, then

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25136-1
01:53:39.324 --> 01:53:43.316
that is going to take a function
of some constant meaning.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25166-0
01:53:43.566 --> 01:53:47.721
Say if you have N is equal to
500 elements and N is equal to

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25166-1
01:53:47.721 --> 01:53:51.400
5000 elements or 50,000
elements, then it is going to

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25166-2
01:53:51.400 --> 01:53:51.876
change.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25193-0
01:53:51.886 --> 01:53:55.530
It is not a constant right,
because here I'm adding 5000

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25193-1
01:53:55.530 --> 01:53:59.301
elements whereas here I'm adding
50,000 elements, so it is

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25193-2
01:53:59.301 --> 01:53:59.876
changing.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25203-0
01:54:00.306 --> 01:54:02.056
So what is the complexity in
this case?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25215-0
01:54:02.226 --> 01:54:06.106
It is proportional to these
input size right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25222-0
01:54:06.116 --> 01:54:07.216
Some of size right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25247-0
01:54:07.426 --> 01:54:10.801
The first one, what we saw was
constant, the previous slide sum

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25247-1
01:54:10.801 --> 01:54:14.016
of the list is going to be some
constant times North, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25255-0
01:54:14.086 --> 01:54:16.616
That N is the size of the input.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25286-0
01:54:17.146 --> 01:54:20.518
Similarly, if you have a matrix,
if you want to sum 2 matrices,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25286-1
01:54:20.518 --> 01:54:23.521
then it is going to go even
beyond which is called North

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25286-2
01:54:23.521 --> 01:54:24.416
Square and so on.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25296-0
01:54:24.466 --> 01:54:25.826
Yeah, you will learn about it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25303-0
01:54:25.836 --> 01:54:27.216
You know later as well.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25305-0
01:54:27.226 --> 01:54:27.346
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25319-0
01:54:28.666 --> 01:54:31.648
So initially for that sum of two
variables, it is always a

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25319-1
01:54:31.648 --> 01:54:32.456
constant, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25325-0
01:54:32.466 --> 01:54:33.796
Let me just erase this.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25328-0
01:54:37.216 --> 01:54:37.476
Oops.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25332-0
01:54:42.126 --> 01:54:42.736
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25355-0
01:54:43.306 --> 01:54:47.330
So whatever input I take you in,
my complexity is remaining the

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25355-1
01:54:47.330 --> 01:54:48.336
same no problem.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25384-0
01:54:48.526 --> 01:54:51.912
But whereas for a list, if I
want to submit a list as my N is

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25384-1
01:54:51.912 --> 01:54:55.406
growing, this is slowly growing,
it is going to take more time.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25388-0
01:54:55.416 --> 01:54:57.916
Here this is time right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25411-0
01:54:58.086 --> 01:55:00.622
Similarly for North squared it
is going even beyond just for

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25411-1
01:55:00.622 --> 01:55:02.576
two matrices I'm going to take
this much time.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25419-0
01:55:02.866 --> 01:55:04.076
We want to add five matrices.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25426-0
01:55:04.086 --> 01:55:05.426
It'll go somewhere here, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25431-0
01:55:05.686 --> 01:55:08.486
It's even larger, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25439-0
01:55:08.496 --> 01:55:09.876
So which one is good for us?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25462-0
01:55:10.866 --> 01:55:15.278
Which time complexity is very
good for us out of, say,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25462-1
01:55:15.278 --> 01:55:18.566
constant yen N square in cube
and so on.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25475-0
01:55:18.936 --> 01:55:21.946
Constant is very good because
regardless of the input it'll

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25475-1
01:55:21.946 --> 01:55:22.096
go.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25489-0
01:55:22.106 --> 01:55:25.946
It'll be working in the same and
now there are two rules.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25501-0
01:55:26.296 --> 01:55:28.106
Yeah, we'll just finish these
rules and pass for today.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25521-0
01:55:28.116 --> 01:55:32.381
Yeah, these rules tells we
analyze time complexity on a

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25521-1
01:55:32.381 --> 01:55:34.056
very large input size.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25529-0
01:55:34.266 --> 01:55:35.136
What did we discuss?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25541-0
01:55:35.146 --> 01:55:38.108
Whenever we are analyzing
algorithms, which case are we

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25541-1
01:55:38.108 --> 01:55:39.006
going to analyze?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25556-0
01:55:40.016 --> 01:55:42.086
Is it best case or average case
or worst case?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25566-0
01:55:43.856 --> 01:55:45.846
Yeah, which case are we going to
1st case?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25603-0
01:55:46.116 --> 01:55:50.656
So we are already telling that
we are going to use worst case

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25603-1
01:55:50.656 --> 01:55:55.343
and imagine your input size to
be very large N large in meaning

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25603-2
01:55:55.343 --> 01:55:57.246
it is as good as Infinity.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25607-0
01:55:57.296 --> 01:55:58.346
Such a large N.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25649-0
01:55:58.896 --> 01:56:03.234
OK, so if you see this term, how
you would have got this line,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25649-1
01:56:03.234 --> 01:56:07.708
can someone take a guess the of
N is equal to N Q3 N square some

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25649-2
01:56:07.708 --> 01:56:10.806
line you have written how you
got this line?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25658-0
01:56:13.076 --> 01:56:14.706
You had got a similar line
today.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25665-0
01:56:14.836 --> 01:56:16.596
Yeah, 610 plus you remember
that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25679-0
01:56:19.746 --> 01:56:22.136
So you have returned some
programs sudo code.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25682-0
01:56:22.146 --> 01:56:23.336
You have countered it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25725-0
01:56:23.406 --> 01:56:26.626
You have submitted it and
finally you have got that answer

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25725-1
01:56:26.626 --> 01:56:30.009
and then this use case you have
got such an answer and got it

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25725-2
01:56:30.009 --> 01:56:33.284
right all of you taking all of
you you analyzed you wrote a

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25725-3
01:56:33.284 --> 01:56:33.556
code.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25749-0
01:56:33.566 --> 01:56:37.150
You analyzed it using counter
primitive in the RAM model you

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25749-1
01:56:37.150 --> 01:56:39.676
submitted it, you got an answer
like this.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25759-0
01:56:39.946 --> 01:56:42.896
In that answer, you're going to
do 2 things.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25777-0
01:56:43.446 --> 01:56:47.086
One is when this end is going to
be very, very large.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25784-0
01:56:47.706 --> 01:56:50.236
This end cube term will be very
dominant.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25803-0
01:56:50.306 --> 01:56:53.939
It will be a very big number in
that is this tool even going to

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25803-1
01:56:53.939 --> 01:56:54.336
matter?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25812-0
01:56:54.726 --> 01:56:56.766
Is this four and all this going
to matter?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25838-0
01:56:57.866 --> 01:57:01.792
So what you will do is you will
drop the lower order terms, you

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25838-1
01:57:01.792 --> 01:57:03.386
will drop all these terms.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25841-0
01:57:03.396 --> 01:57:05.766
You'll ignore it, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25849-0
01:57:06.026 --> 01:57:07.246
And then there is a second rule.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25862-0
01:57:07.256 --> 01:57:11.016
Which days drop the constant
multiplier meaning?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25893-0
01:57:11.026 --> 01:57:14.925
For example, if you see this
first line, 17 N power four when

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25893-1
01:57:14.925 --> 01:57:18.762
north is very very very large,
these 3 N cubed is 8 four and

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25893-2
01:57:18.762 --> 01:57:19.956
all doesn't matter.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25914-0
01:57:19.966 --> 01:57:22.897
This will be small values, but
this will be a very big value,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25914-1
01:57:22.897 --> 01:57:23.936
so ignore these terms.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25931-0
01:57:24.286 --> 01:57:28.556
What you get is 17 empower 4 in
that 17 empower 4.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25942-0
01:57:28.566 --> 01:57:32.052
The second rule says this N
power four is the dominating

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25942-1
01:57:32.052 --> 01:57:32.296
guy.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25950-0
01:57:32.426 --> 01:57:33.356
What does the 17?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25959-0
01:57:33.366 --> 01:57:35.396
It's a constant, so cancel him
also.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25968-0
01:57:35.666 --> 01:57:38.386
So what remains is your time
complexity.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25979-0
01:57:39.906 --> 01:57:41.416
Yeah, let's do that for a couple
of problems.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25987-0
01:57:42.426 --> 01:57:44.996
Four N + 5 who is the dominant
term?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/25993-0
01:57:47.116 --> 01:57:48.576
Yeah, 4 N right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26057-0
01:57:48.776 --> 01:57:52.899
So if I use smaller so eliminate
him, 4 N remains right out of

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26057-1
01:57:52.899 --> 01:57:56.890
this point by end log N minus 2
N plus 7 N log N is the, you

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26057-2
01:57:56.890 --> 01:58:01.143
know dominant term, so it cancel
these out of two power N cubed,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26057-3
01:58:01.143 --> 01:58:05.069
three power N 2 power N is
dominant, cancel the lower order

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26057-4
01:58:05.069 --> 01:58:05.396
term.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26066-0
01:58:06.166 --> 01:58:08.366
Similarly, eliminate the
constant coefficient.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26080-0
01:58:08.376 --> 01:58:10.953
Meaning, if you have four and
four is a constant, so eliminate

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26080-1
01:58:10.953 --> 01:58:11.116
him.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26089-0
01:58:11.126 --> 01:58:14.326
Also, N remains in point when
login.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26098-0
01:58:14.336 --> 01:58:16.566
Eliminate the .5 N log N
remains.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26130-0
01:58:17.026 --> 01:58:19.819
That is why I was telling you,
when you get answers like 6 N

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26130-1
01:58:19.819 --> 01:58:22.795
plus one or six N minus two and
so on, it doesn't matter because

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26130-2
01:58:22.795 --> 01:58:24.076
anyway you will delete this.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26133-0
01:58:24.086 --> 01:58:24.776
Delete this.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26158-0
01:58:24.786 --> 01:58:27.156
This will be N here also delete
this delete.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26169-0
01:58:27.166 --> 01:58:31.647
This will be so that small plus
1 -, 1, it doesn't matter in the

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26169-1
01:58:31.647 --> 01:58:34.886
big picture, when you have a
very large right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26198-0
01:58:35.146 --> 01:58:39.127
So what you get finally after
this, meaning you wrote the

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26198-1
01:58:39.127 --> 01:58:43.244
pseudo code you analyzed it, you
counted the primitives you

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26198-2
01:58:43.244 --> 01:58:44.136
submitted it.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26217-0
01:58:44.246 --> 01:58:47.687
You applied these two rules,
which is called eliminating the

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26217-1
01:58:47.687 --> 01:58:50.056
lower order and eliminating the
constant.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26224-0
01:58:50.506 --> 01:58:52.166
And finally you will get some
answer.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26226-0
01:58:52.886 --> 01:58:53.116
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26233-0
01:58:53.126 --> 01:58:54.156
Will you get to some answer?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26237-0
01:58:55.136 --> 01:58:55.406
Yes.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26239-0
01:58:55.416 --> 01:58:55.626
No.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26248-0
01:58:55.996 --> 01:58:58.186
Do you mean the constant would
make huge difference though.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26277-0
01:58:58.196 --> 01:59:01.513
No it will not, because I'm
imagining this end to be almost

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26277-1
01:59:01.513 --> 01:59:04.386
equal to Infinity when this is
such a big Infinity.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26286-0
01:59:04.556 --> 01:59:07.026
Then why is that constant going
to matter, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26303-0
01:59:07.036 --> 01:59:10.473
Doesn't matter in two power N it
depends on the value of N,

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26303-1
01:59:10.473 --> 01:59:10.816
right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26321-0
01:59:11.026 --> 01:59:14.429
That is why always we are
imagining in is as large as

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26321-1
01:59:14.429 --> 01:59:14.996
Infinity.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26325-0
01:59:15.446 --> 01:59:15.756
We are.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26333-0
01:59:15.766 --> 01:59:18.386
We are not talking about small
lengths, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26342-0
01:59:18.566 --> 01:59:20.666
So finally you will get one
answer.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26345-0
01:59:20.936 --> 01:59:21.076
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26376-0
01:59:21.936 --> 01:59:25.601
And from that answer, we will
start our class next class, we

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26376-1
01:59:25.601 --> 01:59:29.085
will look at what is that
answer, how is it going to help

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26376-2
01:59:29.085 --> 01:59:30.286
us and so on, right.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26397-0
01:59:30.436 --> 01:59:34.181
That answer that we get is
called as order of growth and

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26397-1
01:59:34.181 --> 01:59:36.086
whatever program you analyze.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26409-0
01:59:36.096 --> 01:59:39.176
Finally, you are going to get an
answer like this, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26414-0
01:59:39.186 --> 01:59:40.206
We will talk about this.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26439-0
01:59:40.276 --> 01:59:43.649
We will talk about this order of
growth and finally that answer

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26439-1
01:59:43.649 --> 01:59:46.546
you will put it inside something
called as a notation.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26473-0
01:59:46.636 --> 01:59:49.436
You look at that also in the
next class, it kind of making a

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26473-1
01:59:49.436 --> 01:59:52.053
common ground to compare with
large values exactly right

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26473-2
01:59:52.053 --> 01:59:54.026
because we are going to have a
worst case.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26485-0
01:59:57.516 --> 01:59:58.906
Yeah, it is the same thing,
Vinay.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26488-0
01:59:58.916 --> 01:59:59.226
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26506-0
01:59:59.236 --> 02:00:01.831
So Professor Raghavan would have
covered these topics in his

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26506-1
02:00:01.831 --> 02:00:02.086
class.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26511-0
02:00:02.096 --> 02:00:04.956
Now how 17 the small number?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26529-0
02:00:04.966 --> 02:00:09.425
Uh, in ¥17 power four put a
number for it is not N power

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26529-1
02:00:09.425 --> 02:00:09.816
four.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26531-0
02:00:09.886 --> 02:00:10.376
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26535-0
02:00:10.446 --> 02:00:11.236
Who decided that?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26537-0
02:00:11.246 --> 02:00:11.466
Four.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26542-0
02:00:12.586 --> 02:00:12.986
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26551-0
02:00:13.026 --> 02:00:16.536
We are always imagining a very
large N, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26579-0
02:00:16.546 --> 02:00:20.122
So in that case the small
constants doesn't matter out of

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26579-1
02:00:20.122 --> 02:00:22.896
17 and out of you know, your yen
power four.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26600-0
02:00:23.366 --> 02:00:27.058
If you imagine this yen to be a
very, very large number, that

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26600-1
02:00:27.058 --> 02:00:29.916
answer is way, way greater than
this 17, right?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26605-0
02:00:30.026 --> 02:00:30.906
So it is not needed.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26615-0
02:00:33.556 --> 02:00:36.306
Simple rule, always eliminate
the constant coefficient.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26621-0
02:00:36.486 --> 02:00:38.276
Yeah, simple stuff.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26629-0
02:00:39.296 --> 02:00:40.326
Yeah, I will just.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26656-0
02:00:40.456 --> 02:00:43.083
It is all this and if you just
you know you can ignore this

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26656-1
02:00:43.083 --> 02:00:45.446
slide, we will come back to
these three slides later.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26660-0
02:00:45.716 --> 02:00:46.656
But there is some questions.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26663-0
02:00:47.626 --> 02:00:48.736
This slide is important.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26667-0
02:00:48.986 --> 02:00:49.336
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26688-0
02:00:49.386 --> 02:00:52.517
The first three questions you
will be able to answer write a

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26688-1
02:00:52.517 --> 02:00:55.186
pseudo code for the below and
count the primitives.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26694-0
02:00:55.196 --> 02:00:56.126
Have you already learned this?

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26696-0
02:00:57.436 --> 02:00:57.686
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26751-0
02:00:57.696 --> 02:01:00.664
Do you know how to write a
pseudo code and how to count the

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26751-1
02:01:00.664 --> 02:01:03.682
primitive and submit it and
eliminate those two constant and

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26751-2
02:01:03.682 --> 02:01:06.550
you know constant coefficient
and load order term for all

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26751-3
02:01:06.550 --> 02:01:09.766
these type of programs you will
do it and you will put it in our

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26751-4
02:01:09.766 --> 02:01:10.606
discussion forum.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26755-0
02:01:11.696 --> 02:01:12.326
Yeah.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26782-0
02:01:12.556 --> 02:01:15.506
The other topic of order of
growth and the symbols and all

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26782-1
02:01:15.506 --> 02:01:18.356
that we will start in the next
class and try to do that.

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26795-0
02:01:19.936 --> 02:01:23.840
Yeah, I'll quickly stop the
recording and we will meet the

9240be1a-3c85-4ede-9a05-cbeed290a60e/26795-1
02:01:23.840 --> 02:01:24.766
next Saturday.
