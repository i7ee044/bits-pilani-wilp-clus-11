33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/164-0
00:00:19.782 --> 00:00:20.402
Hi, good morning.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/182-0
00:00:41.812 --> 00:00:42.572
So how are things?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/191-0
00:00:43.742 --> 00:00:44.692
How was your first class?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/199-0
00:00:44.702 --> 00:00:46.142
Last week you had a whole day
class.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/210-0
00:00:50.782 --> 00:00:51.092
Lovely.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/214-0
00:00:51.102 --> 00:00:51.962
You'll get used to it.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/222-0
00:01:04.392 --> 00:01:04.972
OK, OK.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/232-0
00:01:16.252 --> 00:01:16.522
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/235-0
00:01:16.532 --> 00:01:17.042
Yeah, it is.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/242-0
00:01:17.052 --> 00:01:18.002
Back to college days.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/248-0
00:01:18.192 --> 00:01:19.522
It's a full time program, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/256-0
00:01:19.532 --> 00:01:21.272
I mean, it's a degree and then.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/274-0
00:01:31.622 --> 00:01:34.062
Yeah, you had some questions I
hope says I had some questions.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/294-0
00:01:35.582 --> 00:01:38.526
Yeah, you can also put it in
that discussion in canvas if

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/294-1
00:01:38.526 --> 00:01:39.592
it's something quick.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/299-0
00:01:39.602 --> 00:01:40.612
I can also take it up now.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/312-0
00:01:52.162 --> 00:01:53.052
Yes, yes, we'll do that.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/318-0
00:01:53.062 --> 00:01:53.732
Karthikeyan yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/339-0
00:01:53.742 --> 00:01:56.678
So all my classes will have a
quick recap of what we did and

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/339-1
00:01:56.678 --> 00:01:58.892
then we will get started with
the new topics.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/349-0
00:02:06.192 --> 00:02:07.962
Yep, primitive is really simple
now.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/353-0
00:02:07.972 --> 00:02:08.162
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/362-0
00:02:08.172 --> 00:02:11.282
So it's all about the heart of
each statement.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/364-0
00:02:11.372 --> 00:02:11.962
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/374-0
00:02:12.032 --> 00:02:14.882
So something like adding,
multiplying, assigning.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/377-0
00:02:14.972 --> 00:02:15.682
You know, things like that.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/410-0
00:02:20.842 --> 00:02:23.869
But there's an exhaustive list
also in your textbook given, but

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/410-1
00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:26.659
as in, when you practice, you'll
get to know right in each

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/410-2
00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:27.132
statement.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/417-0
00:02:27.602 --> 00:02:29.272
Yeah, sorting is not considered
primitive.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/421-0
00:02:29.282 --> 00:02:29.412
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/443-0
00:02:29.422 --> 00:02:31.958
Because if you see about
sorting, there are a lot of

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/443-1
00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.542
things happening inside sorting
right stack is not a.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/450-0
00:02:34.552 --> 00:02:37.212
Again, you know primitive
operation.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/455-0
00:02:38.592 --> 00:02:39.742
So inside stack, what happens?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/468-0
00:02:39.752 --> 00:02:41.382
There are a lot of things that
we can do, right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/479-0
00:02:41.392 --> 00:02:42.772
Of course we have that in our
course.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/501-0
00:02:42.782 --> 00:02:47.158
We will look at that in detail,
but primitive is that is why the

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/501-1
00:02:47.158 --> 00:02:49.852
other way of primitive is basic,
right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/521-0
00:02:49.862 --> 00:02:52.706
It it is the most basic
operation, like very small

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/521-1
00:02:52.706 --> 00:02:54.212
operations like assignment.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/541-0
00:02:54.422 --> 00:02:58.591
You know, taking a value
additions all basic operations,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/541-1
00:02:58.591 --> 00:03:00.712
arithmetic operations, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/548-0
00:03:00.722 --> 00:03:02.772
All such things are primitive.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/566-0
00:03:04.442 --> 00:03:07.872
I know we talk about sorting,
searching stacks, operations on

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/566-1
00:03:07.872 --> 00:03:08.702
them and so on.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/570-0
00:03:08.712 --> 00:03:10.172
That is not actually primitive.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/577-0
00:03:14.572 --> 00:03:14.782
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/582-0
00:03:14.792 --> 00:03:15.302
Does that help?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/629-0
00:03:22.262 --> 00:03:25.715
Yeah, you need to refer all, so
that is what I told in the first

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/629-1
00:03:25.715 --> 00:03:28.903
class that go the extra mile
just being here and, you know,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/629-2
00:03:28.903 --> 00:03:31.932
having your, you know, slides or
book will not help you.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/672-0
00:03:32.322 --> 00:03:35.244
So please go ahead and that is
your first step attending the

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/672-1
00:03:35.244 --> 00:03:38.262
class and also looking at your
you know textbook is your first

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/672-2
00:03:38.262 --> 00:03:41.328
step but after that you can go
to the you know reference books,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/672-3
00:03:41.328 --> 00:03:42.382
other books and so on.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/676-0
00:03:43.202 --> 00:03:43.362
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/691-0
00:03:44.572 --> 00:03:46.707
We will come to that Prakash
when the time comes, we will

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/691-1
00:03:46.707 --> 00:03:47.222
look at those.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/712-0
00:03:47.232 --> 00:03:50.218
So we will have to again expand
that code and every line of it,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/712-1
00:03:50.218 --> 00:03:51.432
we will do the same thing.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/718-0
00:03:51.852 --> 00:03:52.502
Yeah, we will do that.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/724-0
00:03:52.512 --> 00:03:53.482
We'll have a quick walk.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/728-0
00:03:53.492 --> 00:03:54.542
Yeah, cool.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/738-0
00:03:54.552 --> 00:03:55.842
I think it's good time for us to
start.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/744-0
00:03:55.852 --> 00:03:56.682
It's 8:35.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/756-0
00:03:56.692 --> 00:03:58.842
We have waited for 5 minutes, so
let's quickly do that.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/772-0
00:03:59.092 --> 00:04:01.616
So for all these type of
questions please put it in our

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/772-1
00:04:01.616 --> 00:04:02.382
discussion forum.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/786-0
00:04:02.392 --> 00:04:05.042
Yeah, that is the whole point of
that canvas discussion.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/848-0
00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:08.773
So in the class we'll just look
what these topics and on the way

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/848-1
00:04:08.773 --> 00:04:11.668
we'll have some questions, but
all the, you know, other

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/848-2
00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:15.029
questions that you have, you can
put it in our canvas discussion

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/848-3
00:04:15.029 --> 00:04:18.339
and the TEAMS or me, one of us
will you know, reply to that and

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/848-4
00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:20.252
that is also persisted there,
right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/882-0
00:04:20.262 --> 00:04:23.298
So these calls, you know, it'll
get vanished, and these chats

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/882-1
00:04:23.298 --> 00:04:26.334
will, you know, at the end of
your semester, they'll be like,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/882-2
00:04:26.334 --> 00:04:27.852
you know, 50,000 plus messages.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/896-0
00:04:28.102 --> 00:04:30.562
Yeah, you'll not even know what
was our tool replied and so on.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/921-0
00:04:31.702 --> 00:04:35.016
But in canvas it's all threaded,
so you'll be able to go back and

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/921-1
00:04:35.016 --> 00:04:36.272
revise before your exams.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/925-0
00:04:36.582 --> 00:04:36.832
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/932-0
00:04:36.842 --> 00:04:38.522
So please post questions there
as well.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/945-0
00:04:39.472 --> 00:04:41.192
They also just let me know once
the screen is visible.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/949-0
00:04:45.082 --> 00:04:45.352
Yes.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/952-0
00:04:45.362 --> 00:04:45.762
No, maybe.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/955-0
00:04:49.452 --> 00:04:49.662
Cool.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/975-0
00:04:49.672 --> 00:04:52.613
So welcome to the second contact
session for data structures and

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/975-1
00:04:52.613 --> 00:04:53.382
algorithm design.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/988-0
00:04:53.742 --> 00:04:56.675
And today we will continue our
discussion on analyzing

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/988-1
00:04:56.675 --> 00:04:57.262
algorithms.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/990-0
00:04:57.532 --> 00:04:57.732
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1011-0
00:04:59.182 --> 00:05:01.953
So the agenda for today, we'll
have a quick recap of what we

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1011-1
00:05:01.953 --> 00:05:02.952
did in the last class.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1029-0
00:05:03.322 --> 00:05:06.220
We will then have a quick look
of some general rules and myths

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1029-1
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.692
around, you know, this analysis.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1031-0
00:05:08.022 --> 00:05:08.592
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1056-0
00:05:08.712 --> 00:05:12.223
And we'll also have a look at
how do you analyze algorithms

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1056-1
00:05:12.223 --> 00:05:14.272
which are non recursive in
nature.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1072-0
00:05:14.642 --> 00:05:17.832
We also see what is recursion
and you know things like that.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1084-0
00:05:18.042 --> 00:05:20.652
And if it is a recursive
algorithm, how do we analyze it?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1107-0
00:05:20.842 --> 00:05:23.865
And then there's something
called as a master's theorem,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1107-1
00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:26.252
and we will have some examples
of them pull.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1117-0
00:05:27.332 --> 00:05:29.372
So let's go ahead and have a
quick recap.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1119-0
00:05:30.752 --> 00:05:31.112
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1130-0
00:05:31.122 --> 00:05:32.602
So in the last class we got
started with.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1136-0
00:05:32.612 --> 00:05:33.612
What was this course about?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1151-0
00:05:33.622 --> 00:05:36.222
We'll, you know, spoke about the
textbooks course handout.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1156-0
00:05:36.312 --> 00:05:37.202
What is the program?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1164-0
00:05:37.212 --> 00:05:38.182
What is an algorithm?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1168-0
00:05:38.192 --> 00:05:38.602
And so on.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1189-0
00:05:38.912 --> 00:05:42.697
And then we also had a short
outlook of what we are going to

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1189-1
00:05:42.697 --> 00:05:44.372
do in this semester, right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1196-0
00:05:45.432 --> 00:05:47.802
So all the first few LECTURES,
right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1209-0
00:05:47.892 --> 00:05:49.882
So the 1st 10 second class are
just motivation.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1225-0
00:05:49.892 --> 00:05:52.886
We just learned about what is
algorithms, what do we analyze

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1225-1
00:05:52.886 --> 00:05:53.622
them and so on.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1263-0
00:05:53.872 --> 00:05:56.773
And today as well, we will do
the same thing, but from the

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1263-1
00:05:56.773 --> 00:05:59.428
next class onwards from the
third class till your mid

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1263-2
00:05:59.428 --> 00:06:02.132
semester exams, we will look at
data structures right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1304-0
00:06:02.142 --> 00:06:05.574
There are plenty of data
structures in this field, but we

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1304-1
00:06:05.574 --> 00:06:09.480
will just look at some important
ones like you know, array linked

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1304-2
00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.267
list, stacks, queues, trees, AVL
trees, binary search trees and

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1304-3
00:06:13.267 --> 00:06:13.622
so on.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1306-0
00:06:14.002 --> 00:06:14.442
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1325-0
00:06:14.492 --> 00:06:17.721
And then we'll go for exams and
then we will then start

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1325-1
00:06:17.721 --> 00:06:18.932
algorithm techniques.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1327-0
00:06:18.992 --> 00:06:19.192
Right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1362-0
00:06:19.202 --> 00:06:22.699
We will learn about a lot of
algorithm techniques and in the

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1362-1
00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:26.310
last two classes we will have a
look at those type of problems

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1362-2
00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.062
that are still not solvable
efficiently, right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1371-0
00:06:29.072 --> 00:06:30.932
There are a lot of still
challenging problems.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1396-0
00:06:30.972 --> 00:06:34.195
We are not able to solve them
efficiently even with all they

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1396-1
00:06:34.195 --> 00:06:37.102
know AI way when advanced you
know hardware and so on.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1406-0
00:06:37.372 --> 00:06:39.402
Still, we are not able to solve
them efficiently.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1421-0
00:06:39.612 --> 00:06:42.512
We will look at those in the
last few classes, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1445-0
00:06:42.912 --> 00:06:46.142
So before that, we also looked
at all these, you know,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1445-1
00:06:46.142 --> 00:06:49.372
motivations for why do we do
algorithm analysis right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1490-0
00:06:49.662 --> 00:06:53.008
So for example, if there are two
people who are solving a problem

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1490-1
00:06:53.008 --> 00:06:56.049
right have given given a problem
and Prakriti solves it and

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1490-2
00:06:56.049 --> 00:06:59.293
Surendran doesn't solve it, then
there is no point of even, you

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1490-3
00:06:59.293 --> 00:07:01.372
know discussing an analysis or
anything.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1503-0
00:07:01.382 --> 00:07:03.832
We can directly tell that one of
them has solved it.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1516-0
00:07:03.882 --> 00:07:05.882
The other one has not solved it,
so this is the window.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1528-0
00:07:07.062 --> 00:07:10.448
But the whole problem starts
when all of them are solving it

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1528-1
00:07:10.448 --> 00:07:10.892
correct?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1551-0
00:07:10.982 --> 00:07:14.166
So for example, if there is
sorting, there are 1020

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1551-1
00:07:14.166 --> 00:07:17.412
algorithms which are doing
sorting correctly, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1558-0
00:07:17.422 --> 00:07:18.472
All of them are correct.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1566-0
00:07:18.822 --> 00:07:20.532
Then the question comes who's
better?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1570-0
00:07:21.002 --> 00:07:22.872
Who's performing well, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1585-0
00:07:22.882 --> 00:07:26.066
So that is where the whole field
of algorithm analysis comes into

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1585-1
00:07:26.066 --> 00:07:26.452
picture.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1587-0
00:07:27.512 --> 00:07:27.732
OK.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1597-0
00:07:27.742 --> 00:07:28.842
Is it making sense for all of
you?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1607-0
00:07:29.592 --> 00:07:32.162
Yeah, that is the simplest form,
right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1622-0
00:07:32.172 --> 00:07:35.161
I mean, all of these things are
working, so how do I know

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1622-1
00:07:35.161 --> 00:07:36.192
something is better?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1631-0
00:07:36.462 --> 00:07:38.162
So I need to analyze them right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1655-0
00:07:38.172 --> 00:07:41.200
So that is why algorithm
analysis is done and I'll go for

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1655-1
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.132
the best one when I implement
right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1668-0
00:07:44.432 --> 00:07:46.312
And then we also looked at what
is that better?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1689-0
00:07:46.322 --> 00:07:48.834
Yeah, better means that it is
going to take less amount of

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1689-1
00:07:48.834 --> 00:07:50.112
time and less amount of space.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1743-0
00:07:51.292 --> 00:07:53.951
And we also convinced ourselves
that, you know, this

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1743-1
00:07:53.951 --> 00:07:56.910
experimental studies are not
very effective because if two

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1743-2
00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:59.870
people are going to know, do
this experimental study, they

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1743-3
00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:02.780
need to use the exact same
hardware, exact same software,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1743-4
00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.589
they need to first of all
implement that algorithm as a

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1743-5
00:08:05.589 --> 00:08:06.342
program. Right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1748-0
00:08:06.352 --> 00:08:07.322
Again, there is a problem.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1758-0
00:08:07.332 --> 00:08:09.312
Someone could write it in
assembly language.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1766-0
00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:11.242
Someone can write it in a high
level language.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1777-0
00:08:11.532 --> 00:08:13.702
They all are different in their
speeds, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1796-0
00:08:14.012 --> 00:08:17.031
Assembly language can quickly
talk to the hardware, but high

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1796-1
00:08:17.031 --> 00:08:18.862
level language cannot do that
right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1813-0
00:08:18.872 --> 00:08:22.080
So there are many you know, you
cannot compare an apple with an

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1813-1
00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:22.782
orange, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1844-0
00:08:22.792 --> 00:08:26.156
So we should not do these
experimental studies unless we

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1844-1
00:08:26.156 --> 00:08:29.815
have the exact same, you know,
infrastructure ready for us to

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1844-2
00:08:29.815 --> 00:08:29.992
do.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1853-0
00:08:30.522 --> 00:08:33.072
So we told that we will use this
RAM model.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1866-0
00:08:33.142 --> 00:08:37.092
So this RAM model is nothing but
an imaginary machine, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1883-0
00:08:37.282 --> 00:08:39.646
So it's an imaginary machine
where there is a single

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1883-1
00:08:39.646 --> 00:08:40.092
processor.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1906-0
00:08:40.102 --> 00:08:43.688
Each simple operation or a
primitive operation takes 1 unit

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1906-1
00:08:43.688 --> 00:08:46.616
of time and loops and
subroutines are not simple

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1906-2
00:08:46.616 --> 00:08:47.632
operations right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1920-0
00:08:48.002 --> 00:08:51.032
Because they have code inside
them again, and each line is.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1927-0
00:08:51.182 --> 00:08:52.682
They might have primitive
operations.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1940-0
00:08:54.022 --> 00:08:57.073
We looked at all this and then
we had looked at the pseudo

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1940-1
00:08:57.073 --> 00:08:57.332
code.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1942-0
00:08:57.522 --> 00:08:58.032
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1947-0
00:08:58.122 --> 00:08:58.892
So what about others?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1956-0
00:08:58.952 --> 00:08:59.912
Are you able to hear me?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1964-0
00:08:59.962 --> 00:09:01.352
I see Santosh telling.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1982-0
00:09:01.802 --> 00:09:04.656
So whenever you see says
messages, you can just tell them

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1982-1
00:09:04.656 --> 00:09:06.132
to, you know, quit and rejoin.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/1991-0
00:09:06.522 --> 00:09:07.512
Yeah, they should be able to
hear.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2001-0
00:09:08.992 --> 00:09:12.242
But yeah, so then we spoke about
pseudo codes, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2011-0
00:09:12.252 --> 00:09:13.942
So why do we need this pseudo
code?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2013-0
00:09:14.132 --> 00:09:14.402
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2035-0
00:09:14.412 --> 00:09:19.173
So the first problem was that we
need to communicate between

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2035-1
00:09:19.173 --> 00:09:21.202
fellow programmers, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2049-0
00:09:21.212 --> 00:09:24.486
For example, I know Python, you
might know just Java, you might

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2049-1
00:09:24.486 --> 00:09:24.742
know.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2054-0
00:09:24.752 --> 00:09:25.402
See programming.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2060-0
00:09:25.412 --> 00:09:26.282
I might not know that.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2068-0
00:09:26.512 --> 00:09:29.162
So how do we communicate
solutions then, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2077-0
00:09:29.592 --> 00:09:31.722
One way to do that is plain
English, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2121-0
00:09:31.732 --> 00:09:35.100
I can just write it in a
paragraph and you can just show

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2121-1
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.350
me that this is how I have
solved, but that is again a

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2121-2
00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:41.718
problem because learn English
language will not actually

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2121-3
00:09:41.718 --> 00:09:44.082
capture certain nuances of
programming.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2132-0
00:09:45.262 --> 00:09:48.792
Yeah. For example, assignment,
for example looping right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2158-0
00:09:48.802 --> 00:09:51.909
So such things we will not be
able to capture well in an

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2158-1
00:09:51.909 --> 00:09:54.852
algorithm or just by writing in
plain English, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2164-0
00:09:54.862 --> 00:09:55.732
You can still do that.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2168-0
00:09:55.742 --> 00:09:57.252
That is not wrong. Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2184-0
00:09:57.262 --> 00:09:59.692
So you can write it as step one,
Step 2, step three, Step 4.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2201-0
00:10:00.022 --> 00:10:03.452
You know things like that, but
that will be plain English and

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2201-1
00:10:03.452 --> 00:10:05.222
that might cause some ambiguity.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2222-0
00:10:05.472 --> 00:10:08.482
So we wanted a middle ground and
that is what is a suedo code.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2255-0
00:10:08.992 --> 00:10:13.275
So in simple pseudo code is more
structured than English, but it

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2255-1
00:10:13.275 --> 00:10:17.559
is less detailed than a program,
but definitely remember that if

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2255-2
00:10:17.559 --> 00:10:20.722
you just type the pseudo code it
will not work.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2268-0
00:10:20.782 --> 00:10:23.492
Yeah, it's because this is not
any language at all, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2273-0
00:10:23.502 --> 00:10:25.162
This is language agnostic.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2295-0
00:10:25.412 --> 00:10:29.056
This is used just to communicate
between programmers and we will

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2295-1
00:10:29.056 --> 00:10:31.242
also be able to analyze the sudo
code.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2297-0
00:10:31.652 --> 00:10:32.282
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2313-0
00:10:32.352 --> 00:10:34.570
So we will be able to directly
identify the primitive

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2313-1
00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:35.022
operations.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2326-0
00:10:35.032 --> 00:10:37.952
We will be able to, you know,
analyze them before even

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2326-1
00:10:37.952 --> 00:10:38.802
implementing it.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2343-0
00:10:39.072 --> 00:10:42.095
So once you have written a seudo
code, you have actually solved

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2343-1
00:10:42.095 --> 00:10:42.662
the problem.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2349-0
00:10:42.772 --> 00:10:43.832
You know the solution now?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2363-0
00:10:45.032 --> 00:10:48.060
Then you can translate it into
any language of your choice,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2363-1
00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:48.262
say.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2372-0
00:10:48.692 --> 00:10:51.262
Plus plus Java, Python,
whatever. Right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2379-0
00:10:51.512 --> 00:10:52.542
Yeah, I'm doing a recap.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2388-0
00:10:52.552 --> 00:10:54.872
Yeah, we learned about all that.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2416-0
00:10:55.202 --> 00:10:58.179
And then we also looked at this
primitive operations will also

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2416-1
00:10:58.179 --> 00:11:01.109
look at that today as well, but
counting primitives is a very

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2416-2
00:11:01.109 --> 00:11:01.912
simple technique.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2446-0
00:11:02.182 --> 00:11:05.965
What you do is you just write
your code that is pseudo code

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2446-1
00:11:05.965 --> 00:11:09.369
and then every line you start
inspecting what are the

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2446-2
00:11:09.369 --> 00:11:11.072
primitive operations in it.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2454-0
00:11:11.472 --> 00:11:13.932
Yeah, assignment is a primitive
operation.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2465-0
00:11:14.222 --> 00:11:15.992
I reindexing is a primitive
operation.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2473-0
00:11:16.182 --> 00:11:17.912
Comparison is a primitive
operation.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2480-0
00:11:18.122 --> 00:11:19.712
Addition is a primitive
operation.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2488-0
00:11:19.922 --> 00:11:22.072
Return is a primitive operation,
right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2500-0
00:11:22.302 --> 00:11:24.982
And there are some lines which
are inside a loop, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2515-0
00:11:24.992 --> 00:11:27.642
So I'll have to see how many
times that line will execute.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2543-0
00:11:28.012 --> 00:11:31.292
So this line has three primitive
operation, array indexing,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2543-1
00:11:31.292 --> 00:11:34.627
addition, assignment and this
line itself executes more than

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2543-2
00:11:34.627 --> 00:11:35.502
one time, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2556-0
00:11:35.512 --> 00:11:37.782
Because it is in a loop, so I'll
calculate those.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2600-0
00:11:37.792 --> 00:11:41.827
I'll submit all that and I will
get something like this and then

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2600-1
00:11:41.827 --> 00:11:45.676
we learned about a couple of
rules right there were these two

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2600-2
00:11:45.676 --> 00:11:49.712
rules that I will drop the lower
order term and I will also drop

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2600-3
00:11:49.712 --> 00:11:51.202
the constant multiplier.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2624-0
00:11:52.142 --> 00:11:56.373
The reason for doing that was we
convinced ourselves that always

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2624-1
00:11:56.373 --> 00:11:58.912
we will do worst case analysis,
right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2643-0
00:11:59.042 --> 00:12:02.779
We can analyze algorithms on
many ways, yeah, but we want to

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2643-1
00:12:02.779 --> 00:12:04.372
know their worst behavior.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2651-0
00:12:04.582 --> 00:12:06.352
And the worst days, how are they
behaving?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2679-0
00:12:06.762 --> 00:12:10.507
Meaning when the end is very
large for all our program, there

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2679-1
00:12:10.507 --> 00:12:14.312
is some input right when that
input is very very large, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2691-0
00:12:14.322 --> 00:12:17.372
It is almost tending to Infinity
at that stage.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2705-0
00:12:17.662 --> 00:12:21.124
These lower order terms hardly
matter, and these constants also

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2705-1
00:12:21.124 --> 00:12:21.882
hardly matter.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2716-0
00:12:22.092 --> 00:12:24.892
It is that N which will be
dominating right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2740-0
00:12:24.902 --> 00:12:28.826
So we can drop all that and we
will get some final answer,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2740-1
00:12:28.826 --> 00:12:32.352
right and that is called the
Order of growth, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2757-0
00:12:32.362 --> 00:12:35.535
So this is what we had looked at
in the last Class 3 steps,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2757-1
00:12:35.535 --> 00:12:35.852
right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2774-0
00:12:35.862 --> 00:12:38.462
Whenever a problem is given,
firstly you'll think about it.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2805-0
00:12:38.472 --> 00:12:41.727
You'll write it pseudo code once
we have written it pseudo code

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2805-1
00:12:41.727 --> 00:12:44.676
you will see the primitive
operation in each line and you

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2805-2
00:12:44.676 --> 00:12:45.592
will note it down.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2831-0
00:12:46.392 --> 00:12:49.611
You will submit it once you
submit it, you will get an

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2831-1
00:12:49.611 --> 00:12:52.362
equation right six n + 510 N
plus 20 whatever.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2850-0
00:12:52.832 --> 00:12:56.154
And then that you will ignore
your lower order constant and

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2850-1
00:12:56.154 --> 00:12:58.702
you'll also ignore your constant
multipliers.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2873-0
00:12:58.832 --> 00:13:02.927
You will complete that and
finally you will get that answer

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2873-1
00:13:02.927 --> 00:13:05.862
and that will always be inside
this right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2907-0
00:13:05.872 --> 00:13:09.570
It'll be either one either log
N, log N square N cube, or in

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2907-1
00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:13.330
between there could be a lot of
things like N power 4 N power

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2907-2
00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:14.482
five and power 100.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2928-0
00:13:14.582 --> 00:13:18.736
All that can be there or it can
be of the form to power north or

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2928-1
00:13:18.736 --> 00:13:20.142
north factorial right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2940-0
00:13:20.392 --> 00:13:22.902
Since uh Infinity power four is
Infinity, uh.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2947-0
00:13:22.912 --> 00:13:25.162
Can't we consider N power four
is just N?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2953-0
00:13:25.252 --> 00:13:26.382
No, we cannot do that.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2955-0
00:13:26.712 --> 00:13:27.202
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2970-0
00:13:27.252 --> 00:13:30.912
So we are not considering end to
the power Infinity end itself.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2986-0
00:13:30.922 --> 00:13:34.017
We are considering as Infinity
right and we are not considering

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2986-1
00:13:34.017 --> 00:13:34.742
an as Infinity.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/2994-0
00:13:35.112 --> 00:13:37.442
We are assuming it is that
bigger number.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3003-0
00:13:38.312 --> 00:13:39.642
Yeah, I was just giving an
analogy.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3010-0
00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:42.062
There it is, almost moving
towards Infinity.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3029-0
00:13:42.132 --> 00:13:46.250
It is not Infinity and we are
again not talking about yen

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3029-1
00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:47.812
power Infinity, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3045-0
00:13:49.672 --> 00:13:52.319
And of course, for any input,
nobody's going to give Infinity

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3045-1
00:13:52.319 --> 00:13:53.002
as input, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3062-0
00:13:53.012 --> 00:13:55.926
We will not be able to give
Infinity because Infinity is not

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3062-1
00:13:55.926 --> 00:13:56.882
quantifiable, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3073-0
00:13:57.132 --> 00:13:58.042
This very large number.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3102-0
00:13:59.612 --> 00:14:03.078
So this is what is order of
growth that is, we expect our

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3102-1
00:14:03.078 --> 00:14:06.844
algorithms to work faster for
all the values of N, but that is

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3102-2
00:14:06.844 --> 00:14:07.382
not true.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3105-0
00:14:07.732 --> 00:14:08.042
Great.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3135-0
00:14:08.052 --> 00:14:12.751
If you see here, this N is
nothing but 12481632 were just

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3135-1
00:14:12.751 --> 00:14:14.452
doubling it after 32.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3140-0
00:14:14.462 --> 00:14:16.402
You'll have 64128 and so on.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3148-0
00:14:16.632 --> 00:14:17.662
This is your normal yen.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3153-0
00:14:17.752 --> 00:14:18.702
You're just doubling it.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3164-0
00:14:19.092 --> 00:14:20.892
OK, but what about this login?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3230-0
00:14:21.912 --> 00:14:24.936
When you substitute these N
value in log N, what are you

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3230-1
00:14:24.936 --> 00:14:27.960
getting the values you're
getting some values 012 and so

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3230-2
00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:31.144
on and then column is again the
same column N log N you are

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3230-3
00:14:31.144 --> 00:14:34.646
calculating login value and then
multiplying that with yen so you

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3230-4
00:14:34.646 --> 00:14:36.662
are getting this as the values
right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3234-0
00:14:36.672 --> 00:14:38.002
They're all almost comparable.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3245-0
00:14:38.012 --> 00:14:39.772
They're almost the same, even
with 16.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3257-0
00:14:39.782 --> 00:14:43.122
They're all like, you know, over
1664 and so on.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3280-0
00:14:43.372 --> 00:14:46.133
But suddenly when you have N
square here you see that till

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3280-1
00:14:46.133 --> 00:14:48.052
here they were almost in the
same range.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3310-0
00:14:48.062 --> 00:14:51.334
But here, suddenly this has
become a 3 digit number and for

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3310-1
00:14:51.334 --> 00:14:54.552
the N cube for here it all
started together, they were all

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3310-2
00:14:54.552 --> 00:14:55.752
a single digit number.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3315-0
00:14:55.762 --> 00:14:56.712
They were all comparable.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3326-0
00:14:56.722 --> 00:14:59.232
They're OK, but here it became a
2 digit.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3332-0
00:14:59.242 --> 00:15:00.612
Here it has bombarded already.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3335-0
00:15:00.662 --> 00:15:01.192
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3364-0
00:15:01.242 --> 00:15:05.976
So for log in it is just three
whereas N cube is 512 and for 16

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3364-1
00:15:05.976 --> 00:15:07.382
it has become 4000.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3379-0
00:15:08.522 --> 00:15:12.063
Whereas if you see two power yen
initially they were all OK,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3379-1
00:15:12.063 --> 00:15:12.412
right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3423-0
00:15:12.702 --> 00:15:17.400
Two power one was 2/2 power, two
was 4/2 power, four was 16,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3423-1
00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:21.868
whereas 2 power 8 suddenly
became two 58256 and two power

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3423-2
00:15:21.868 --> 00:15:24.872
16 is already 65,000 and two
power 32.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3430-0
00:15:24.882 --> 00:15:25.892
You see the number here, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3433-0
00:15:26.672 --> 00:15:27.092
So big.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3440-0
00:15:28.762 --> 00:15:29.932
So what do you really mean?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3465-0
00:15:30.002 --> 00:15:35.147
Yeah, when this N value
increases, is it better to have

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3465-1
00:15:35.147 --> 00:15:37.812
our final complexities log N?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3469-0
00:15:37.822 --> 00:15:38.652
Something like this?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3480-0
00:15:38.662 --> 00:15:41.112
Or is it better to have N Q2,
power N etcetera?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3482-0
00:15:45.422 --> 00:15:45.562
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3485-0
00:15:47.402 --> 00:15:47.862
Real quick.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3520-0
00:15:50.972 --> 00:15:54.853
So I do all this so from this
table, what are we understanding

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3520-1
00:15:54.853 --> 00:15:58.673
like log N, log N are these guys
good or are N cube 2 power N

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3520-2
00:15:58.673 --> 00:15:59.782
these things good?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3529-0
00:16:00.372 --> 00:16:02.152
Yeah, the left hand sides are
good.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3549-0
00:16:02.162 --> 00:16:06.404
Yeah, because even when North is
increasing, their values are not

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3549-1
00:16:06.404 --> 00:16:07.882
drastically increasing.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3563-0
00:16:08.752 --> 00:16:12.082
Where is this N cube 2, power N
factorial, etcetera.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3576-0
00:16:12.532 --> 00:16:17.015
When north is increasing, their
values are rapidly increasing,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3576-1
00:16:17.015 --> 00:16:17.442
right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3599-0
00:16:17.762 --> 00:16:21.474
So that is what we put it in
this chart or this equation,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3599-1
00:16:21.474 --> 00:16:22.882
that one is very good.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3621-0
00:16:22.892 --> 00:16:25.983
Yeah, irrespective of whatever
input you give, I'll have a

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3621-1
00:16:25.983 --> 00:16:28.602
constant complexity, just one,
one constant time.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3637-0
00:16:30.042 --> 00:16:34.121
Then login is better then end is
OK N log N is better N square,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3637-1
00:16:34.121 --> 00:16:34.312
NQ.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3656-0
00:16:34.322 --> 00:16:37.651
These are all OK, so one log N
etcetera are very good in

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3656-1
00:16:37.651 --> 00:16:39.112
between whatever we have.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3676-0
00:16:39.122 --> 00:16:42.302
It is moderate and in the
extreme end there's two power N

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3676-1
00:16:42.302 --> 00:16:43.892
factor etcetera are very bad.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3680-0
00:16:44.482 --> 00:16:44.712
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3700-0
00:16:44.722 --> 00:16:48.197
Because if you give a larger
input, it is going to take, you

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3700-1
00:16:48.197 --> 00:16:51.102
know large amount of, you know
computation, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3705-0
00:16:51.112 --> 00:16:53.232
That is a problem, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3717-0
00:16:53.552 --> 00:16:56.432
And finally you have to put this
in some notation, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3732-0
00:16:56.622 --> 00:16:59.352
So that is what is called as an
asymptotic notation.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3752-0
00:16:59.782 --> 00:17:02.766
Yeah, they are just, you know,
languages that allow us to

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3752-1
00:17:02.766 --> 00:17:05.082
analyze an algorithm and depict
them, right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3759-0
00:17:05.092 --> 00:17:06.042
So there are three guys.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3765-0
00:17:06.052 --> 00:17:07.192
One is called bingo.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3776-0
00:17:07.282 --> 00:17:09.222
One is Big Omega and one is big
Theta.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3779-0
00:17:10.062 --> 00:17:10.632
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3783-0
00:17:10.742 --> 00:17:11.432
Could you give example?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3794-0
00:17:11.442 --> 00:17:12.932
Yeah, that is what we will look
at today, Rajesh.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3798-0
00:17:12.942 --> 00:17:13.002
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3817-0
00:17:14.272 --> 00:17:17.033
So Bigo, bigo, mega, Big Theta
corresponds to two three

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3817-1
00:17:17.033 --> 00:17:19.252
different things that we already
learned so.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3832-0
00:17:21.312 --> 00:17:24.602
Big own notation is used to
represent the worst case, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3864-0
00:17:24.612 --> 00:17:27.885
We are always interested in the
worst case in simple it is the

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3864-1
00:17:27.885 --> 00:17:31.263
measure of the longest amount of
time it could possibly take for

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3864-2
00:17:31.263 --> 00:17:32.562
an algorithm to complete.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3872-0
00:17:33.092 --> 00:17:34.542
Right, you are putting an upper
bound.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3892-0
00:17:34.552 --> 00:17:37.809
You are telling that whatever
you give us input, this

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3892-1
00:17:37.809 --> 00:17:40.342
algorithm will not take beyond
this time.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3894-0
00:17:41.102 --> 00:17:41.262
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3902-0
00:17:42.272 --> 00:17:43.322
What are you gonna upper bound?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3905-0
00:17:43.372 --> 00:17:43.822
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3913-0
00:17:43.872 --> 00:17:45.352
So can you get above 100 marks?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3923-0
00:17:46.862 --> 00:17:49.862
Yeah, putting a threshold on
your exam marks.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3928-0
00:17:50.762 --> 00:17:51.482
What is that?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3936-0
00:17:51.942 --> 00:17:53.532
That is nothing but big O,
right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3944-0
00:17:53.542 --> 00:17:54.712
Maximum you can get 100.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3949-0
00:17:54.862 --> 00:17:56.672
You cannot go beyond that,
right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3981-0
00:17:56.682 --> 00:17:59.394
Similarly, for every algorithm,
you are putting an upper

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3981-1
00:17:59.394 --> 00:18:02.296
threshold or upper bound and
you're telling that this is the

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3981-2
00:18:02.296 --> 00:18:04.532
longest amount of time it could
possibly take.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/3990-0
00:18:04.722 --> 00:18:07.262
It cannot take above that right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4030-0
00:18:07.472 --> 00:18:11.357
So if F of North is actually our
time taken by our algorithm,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4030-1
00:18:11.357 --> 00:18:15.180
you're telling that you are
putting an upper bound called CG

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4030-2
00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:18.752
of north, and telling our
algorithms time taken will not

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4030-3
00:18:18.752 --> 00:18:19.692
go beyond this.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4040-0
00:18:20.062 --> 00:18:23.512
This is the worst case
complexity Big Omega.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4047-0
00:18:23.562 --> 00:18:25.432
It is the best case, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4059-0
00:18:25.742 --> 00:18:27.992
Can any algorithm run in zero
time units?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4063-0
00:18:29.382 --> 00:18:30.102
They are real quick.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4076-0
00:18:32.142 --> 00:18:33.632
I'd also seen a couple of
questions.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4092-0
00:18:33.642 --> 00:18:37.362
We will, you know, look at that
once we are done with this deck.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4101-0
00:18:37.372 --> 00:18:38.432
Yeah, we cannot have it right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4111-0
00:18:38.442 --> 00:18:40.142
So zero time you would never
possible.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4119-0
00:18:40.352 --> 00:18:43.309
There is some amount of
computation definitely needed,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4119-1
00:18:43.309 --> 00:18:43.632
right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4172-0
00:18:43.772 --> 00:18:47.301
So that time putting it as a
lower bound and I'm telling that

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4172-1
00:18:47.301 --> 00:18:50.945
it is the measure of the least
amount of time date, so at least

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4172-2
00:18:50.945 --> 00:18:54.532
some amount of time algorithm
will take and that is this least

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4172-3
00:18:54.532 --> 00:18:56.752
amount be less than this least
amount.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4176-0
00:18:56.762 --> 00:18:57.352
It cannot run.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4194-0
00:18:57.642 --> 00:19:01.692
At least this much time it will
take and then finally average

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4194-1
00:19:01.692 --> 00:19:03.522
complexity is the big Theta.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4197-0
00:19:03.752 --> 00:19:04.132
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4237-0
00:19:04.142 --> 00:19:07.395
So you are putting, you know, an
upper bound and lower bound for

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4237-1
00:19:07.395 --> 00:19:10.599
your, you know, time taken and
you're telling that it will rain

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4237-2
00:19:10.599 --> 00:19:13.502
somewhere in this, you know,
upper bound and lower bound.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4254-0
00:19:14.012 --> 00:19:17.742
So which is that particular
notation that we are going to

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4254-1
00:19:17.742 --> 00:19:19.222
use across this course?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4266-0
00:19:20.562 --> 00:19:23.442
Are we going to use best case or
worst case or average case?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4291-0
00:19:25.542 --> 00:19:28.603
Because always we told we are
going to take a very large yen

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4291-1
00:19:28.603 --> 00:19:30.812
and we are going to do worst
case analysis.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4309-0
00:19:31.082 --> 00:19:34.869
So when we are doing worst case
analysis, we want this big O

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4309-1
00:19:34.869 --> 00:19:35.862
notation, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4424-0
00:19:37.512 --> 00:19:41.260
So then finally, what we will do
is we will put it inside this

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4424-1
00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:45.068
big O notation, meaning it is a
big O bracket and then whatever

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4424-2
00:19:45.068 --> 00:19:48.698
answer you had got after all
that analysis, right, so now we

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4424-3
00:19:48.698 --> 00:19:52.446
will just complete that story of
again recapping, I give you a

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4424-4
00:19:52.446 --> 00:19:56.016
problem, right, for example this
this question like minimum

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4424-5
00:19:56.016 --> 00:19:59.527
element in an array, yeah, you
first write the pseudo code

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4424-6
00:19:59.527 --> 00:20:03.156
after writing the pseudo code
line by line, you go ahead and

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4424-7
00:20:03.156 --> 00:20:06.726
try to calculate the primitive
operation and then Pranav or

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4424-8
00:20:06.726 --> 00:20:08.452
someone had asked in between.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4440-0
00:20:09.042 --> 00:20:12.624
Anyway, you are going to ignore
constant and you know all those

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4440-1
00:20:12.624 --> 00:20:14.192
smaller elements at the end.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4450-0
00:20:14.342 --> 00:20:16.672
Then why should I focus on every
line, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4461-0
00:20:16.682 --> 00:20:18.452
Why should I carefully do and
then?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4463-0
00:20:18.462 --> 00:20:19.252
Anyway, ignore it.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4490-0
00:20:19.742 --> 00:20:23.517
Yeah, that is because in every
line when you inspect, there

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4490-1
00:20:23.517 --> 00:20:26.412
could also be some yen involved
there, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4509-0
00:20:26.792 --> 00:20:30.015
Your final rule says you will
only ignore the constant

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4509-1
00:20:30.015 --> 00:20:32.242
multiplier and that lower order
term.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4523-0
00:20:32.982 --> 00:20:36.032
But what if there are some other
higher order terms in each line?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4533-0
00:20:36.442 --> 00:20:37.952
Yeah, there are some loops and
so on.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4543-0
00:20:38.282 --> 00:20:40.192
That is why we are carefully
observing them.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4553-0
00:20:40.362 --> 00:20:42.232
We'll look at some examples
across the crows.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4559-0
00:20:42.242 --> 00:20:43.252
You will get that point.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4562-0
00:20:43.262 --> 00:20:43.382
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4574-0
00:20:44.702 --> 00:20:46.352
What if there are other yens in
them?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4576-0
00:20:46.402 --> 00:20:47.312
Inside each line.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4600-0
00:20:47.822 --> 00:20:51.409
Yeah, that is why we have to
locate each line, write the

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4600-1
00:20:51.409 --> 00:20:53.612
primitive operations, submit
them.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4620-0
00:20:54.102 --> 00:20:57.347
After summarizing it, you know
try to cancel or, you know,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4620-1
00:20:57.347 --> 00:21:00.262
summarize and get a small
equation and what is that?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4628-0
00:21:00.472 --> 00:21:02.802
Whatever we are getting, what is
that called?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4634-0
00:21:04.672 --> 00:21:05.442
Real quick anyone?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4637-0
00:21:11.422 --> 00:21:11.672
Yes.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4654-0
00:21:11.682 --> 00:21:15.612
No, that 6 N plus one or five N
+ 10.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4682-0
00:21:15.622 --> 00:21:18.128
Whatever you're getting at the
end, you are writing the

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4682-1
00:21:18.128 --> 00:21:20.948
primitive operations, submitting
it, cancelling them, and what

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4682-2
00:21:20.948 --> 00:21:23.052
you are getting is called the
order of growth.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4712-0
00:21:23.382 --> 00:21:27.214
Yeah, you are getting the order
of growth and that order of

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4712-1
00:21:27.214 --> 00:21:31.175
growth, you will put it inside
the asymptotic notation, which

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4712-2
00:21:31.175 --> 00:21:32.772
is big O notation, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4721-0
00:21:33.322 --> 00:21:34.752
So I request you to solve these.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4754-0
00:21:34.762 --> 00:21:37.722
So I saw a lot of people who had
already solved this, but try to,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4754-1
00:21:37.722 --> 00:21:40.367
you know, solve this true or
false also and we will have a

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4754-2
00:21:40.367 --> 00:21:41.982
discussion around it in our
canvas.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4756-0
00:21:43.752 --> 00:21:44.002
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4761-0
00:21:44.012 --> 00:21:44.862
Is this looking good?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4763-0
00:21:45.012 --> 00:21:45.322
Yes.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4766-0
00:21:45.332 --> 00:21:45.692
No, maybe.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4780-0
00:21:48.492 --> 00:21:51.242
That is all we have discussed so
far, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4783-0
00:21:52.132 --> 00:21:53.832
All of you simple stuff.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4799-0
00:21:56.732 --> 00:21:58.882
All that being said, we will
continue this right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4806-0
00:21:58.892 --> 00:22:01.182
Some asymptotic notation
analogies for you.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4811-0
00:22:01.232 --> 00:22:01.492
Right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4818-0
00:22:02.272 --> 00:22:04.702
The delivery will be within your
lifetime.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4820-0
00:22:04.792 --> 00:22:05.122
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4822-0
00:22:05.132 --> 00:22:05.672
What?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4829-0
00:22:06.172 --> 00:22:07.262
What does this denoting?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4843-0
00:22:07.272 --> 00:22:09.952
Is it big O notation or big
Omega or big Theta?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4855-0
00:22:11.432 --> 00:22:14.572
Or in other words, is it average
case, best case or worst case?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4860-0
00:22:16.762 --> 00:22:17.012
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4870-0
00:22:17.022 --> 00:22:18.482
Give importance to this word
within.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4880-0
00:22:19.282 --> 00:22:21.112
Yeah, this is big O notation,
right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4886-0
00:22:21.122 --> 00:22:22.632
You are putting an upper
threshold.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4903-0
00:22:22.882 --> 00:22:25.580
You're telling within your life
time this will definitely

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4903-1
00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:26.232
happen, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4922-0
00:22:27.512 --> 00:22:32.360
This big O notation or upper
bound or worst case I can pay

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4922-1
00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:33.922
you at least $1.00.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4925-0
00:22:34.292 --> 00:22:34.562
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4928-0
00:22:34.572 --> 00:22:35.322
What is this?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4939-0
00:22:35.492 --> 00:22:37.972
Is it worst case or best case or
average case?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4953-0
00:22:39.952 --> 00:22:42.722
Yeah, at least $1.00 LP less
than $1.00.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4956-0
00:22:42.732 --> 00:22:43.062
I'll not.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4962-0
00:22:43.072 --> 00:22:44.422
Yeah, at least $1.00 definitely.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4972-0
00:22:44.432 --> 00:22:45.732
I'll give I can give you more
also.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/4987-0
00:22:46.432 --> 00:22:50.202
Yeah, this is big Omega or it is
best case or lower bound.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5018-0
00:22:50.272 --> 00:22:54.216
Best case, at least $1.00 LB the
high today will be 25 degrees

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5018-1
00:22:54.216 --> 00:22:57.722
and the low will be 19, so we
are putting a range here.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5030-0
00:22:58.172 --> 00:23:01.468
The moment we are putting range,
we are giving big Theta or

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5030-1
00:23:01.468 --> 00:23:02.182
average case.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5033-0
00:23:04.052 --> 00:23:04.322
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5056-0
00:23:04.332 --> 00:23:08.206
Is this clear guys for all of
you simple analogies, we will

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5056-1
00:23:08.206 --> 00:23:10.402
always stick to this upper
bound.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5068-0
00:23:10.852 --> 00:23:13.012
So now there is this question
that comes into my mind.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5116-0
00:23:14.182 --> 00:23:17.744
So what does the very large you
know order of growth that we saw

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5116-1
00:23:17.744 --> 00:23:21.087
in that chart that we saw and
and log N square and Q and all

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5116-2
00:23:21.087 --> 00:23:24.155
that in that what was the very
last thing that we saw N

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5116-3
00:23:24.155 --> 00:23:25.142
factorial correct.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5149-0
00:23:25.222 --> 00:23:29.074
And then before that, you also
had your two power N so that is

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5149-1
00:23:29.074 --> 00:23:33.049
a very large number, correct go
for any complexity question that

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5149-2
00:23:33.049 --> 00:23:34.272
I asked in the exam.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5158-0
00:23:35.232 --> 00:23:39.352
If you just go about writing
that upper bound, yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5165-0
00:23:39.362 --> 00:23:41.062
Are you technically correct by
doing that?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5176-0
00:23:44.122 --> 00:23:47.262
Yeah, no big goal is the worst
case, Rajesh. Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5199-0
00:23:50.232 --> 00:23:53.016
So whatever algorithm I ask, you
are not analyzing, you're not

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5199-1
00:23:53.016 --> 00:23:54.342
using the primitive operation.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5201-0
00:23:54.352 --> 00:23:54.722
Nothing.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5216-0
00:23:54.872 --> 00:23:59.662
You just tell that my complexity
is big off 2 power N factorial.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5224-0
00:23:59.772 --> 00:24:01.242
Yeah, such a big number, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5246-0
00:24:02.092 --> 00:24:06.572
Let me just write it here for
you to put a test big off 2

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5246-1
00:24:06.572 --> 00:24:07.962
power N factorial.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5254-0
00:24:09.582 --> 00:24:11.812
That is a very, very large
number, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5273-0
00:24:12.032 --> 00:24:14.640
And that'll definitely, you
know, contain this within or it

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5273-1
00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:15.422
is the worst case.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5290-0
00:24:15.582 --> 00:24:18.688
So any algorithm for that
matter, it's complexity will be

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5290-1
00:24:18.688 --> 00:24:19.492
less than that.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5305-0
00:24:20.352 --> 00:24:24.202
And by pure definition of bigot,
you're putting an upper limit.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5332-0
00:24:24.492 --> 00:24:28.021
You're putting an upper limit
that my algorithm will take less

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5332-1
00:24:28.021 --> 00:24:31.382
than this time, so technically
by Viggo definition and your

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5332-2
00:24:31.382 --> 00:24:31.942
smartness.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5334-0
00:24:31.952 --> 00:24:32.412
Is this correct?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5338-0
00:24:35.482 --> 00:24:35.662
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5345-0
00:24:36.692 --> 00:24:37.962
Wait, JAGDISH, why we cannot
give?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5353-0
00:24:38.932 --> 00:24:40.632
Because there's a very large
number, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5375-0
00:24:42.602 --> 00:24:45.632
So the whole point of Vigo
notation is that we are putting

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5375-1
00:24:45.632 --> 00:24:46.402
an upper limit.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5401-0
00:24:46.702 --> 00:24:50.360
We are telling that whatever you
do, whatever input you give,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5401-1
00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:53.782
this is the maximum possible
time my algorithm will take.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5443-0
00:24:54.042 --> 00:24:57.292
So if you choose a very, very
large you know function like

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5443-1
00:24:57.292 --> 00:25:00.653
this two power N factorial or
you know north Power N power N

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5443-2
00:25:00.653 --> 00:25:03.793
something like this then
technically your algorithm will

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5443-3
00:25:03.793 --> 00:25:05.832
take less than this time
complexity.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5451-0
00:25:06.252 --> 00:25:09.092
So by definition, is this
correct N factorial?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5458-0
00:25:09.102 --> 00:25:10.582
Yeah, it is a factorial rumic.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5466-0
00:25:12.642 --> 00:25:14.232
Yeah, but we will never compare.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5474-0
00:25:14.242 --> 00:25:15.322
Yeah, for both the algorithms.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5487-0
00:25:15.332 --> 00:25:19.442
If I just put that both of them
are taking this much time, yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5492-0
00:25:21.392 --> 00:25:21.682
Cool.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5499-0
00:25:21.692 --> 00:25:24.342
So technically, by definition
this is correct.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5510-0
00:25:24.412 --> 00:25:26.874
Yeah, but it doesn't have, you
know, any practical

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5510-1
00:25:26.874 --> 00:25:27.502
significance.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5514-0
00:25:27.552 --> 00:25:28.442
JAGDISH was right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5545-0
00:25:28.712 --> 00:25:32.129
So if you just put this very,
very large things as you know

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5545-1
00:25:32.129 --> 00:25:35.033
your complexity, then you are
not getting any real

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5545-2
00:25:35.033 --> 00:25:36.172
significance, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5555-0
00:25:36.482 --> 00:25:38.172
But nobody can tell that this is
wrong.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5597-0
00:25:38.182 --> 00:25:41.185
If you write a statement that my
algorithm is taking less than we

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5597-1
00:25:41.185 --> 00:25:44.097
go off 2 power N factorial, it
is actually correct because this

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5597-2
00:25:44.097 --> 00:25:46.737
is a very large function and
your program might take less

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5597-3
00:25:46.737 --> 00:25:47.192
than this.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5605-0
00:25:48.312 --> 00:25:50.242
But who are you fooling by doing
this?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5609-0
00:25:50.292 --> 00:25:50.882
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5632-0
00:25:50.972 --> 00:25:54.714
So that is why there is a line
in theoretical computer science

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5632-1
00:25:54.714 --> 00:25:57.922
that algorithm analysis must be
as tight as possible.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5656-0
00:25:58.392 --> 00:26:05.036
Yeah, if if there is a function
like this right N power of 4 +

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5656-1
00:26:05.036 --> 00:26:07.462
N, cube plus ¥10 + 200.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5667-0
00:26:08.422 --> 00:26:10.532
So for this, what is the big O
complexity?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5671-0
00:26:10.542 --> 00:26:11.242
Can someone tell me?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5678-0
00:26:13.722 --> 00:26:14.652
They are real quick.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5696-0
00:26:14.742 --> 00:26:17.242
I'm spending a lot of time in
this because I want you to

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5696-1
00:26:17.242 --> 00:26:18.602
understand this real, you know.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5702-0
00:26:21.122 --> 00:26:21.992
There is a constant.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5706-0
00:26:22.002 --> 00:26:22.452
Leave it.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5714-0
00:26:22.622 --> 00:26:23.692
This is a lower order term.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5717-0
00:26:23.702 --> 00:26:24.112
Leave it.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5723-0
00:26:24.182 --> 00:26:25.172
This is a lower order term.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5738-0
00:26:25.182 --> 00:26:28.032
Leave it N power four is the you
know, thing.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5753-0
00:26:28.242 --> 00:26:32.160
Order of growth to put this,
this is the answer perfect all

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5753-1
00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:33.532
of you are right now.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5764-0
00:26:34.102 --> 00:26:36.372
What if I put in power 100?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5772-0
00:26:37.612 --> 00:26:38.422
Is this also correct?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5824-0
00:26:40.312 --> 00:26:43.623
The Empower 4 is greater than
North Power N Power 100 is

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5824-1
00:26:43.623 --> 00:26:47.282
greater than N power four, so
north Power 100 is also correct,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5824-2
00:26:47.282 --> 00:26:50.709
but it is not as tight as
possible, meaning this algorithm

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5824-3
00:26:50.709 --> 00:26:54.484
might maximum take N power four
only then why are you putting it

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5824-4
00:26:54.484 --> 00:26:55.762
as N power 100, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5859-0
00:26:56.552 --> 00:26:59.224
So now you get the knowledge
right for any question that I

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5859-1
00:26:59.224 --> 00:27:02.122
ask you in complexity, you can
put a very very large number and

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5859-2
00:27:02.122 --> 00:27:03.752
tell this is what the
complexities.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5882-0
00:27:04.642 --> 00:27:08.956
But it is not tight as possible
and that is not the right way to

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5882-1
00:27:08.956 --> 00:27:12.142
analyze algorithms, but just by
the definition.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5905-0
00:27:12.152 --> 00:27:15.741
If someone goes if someone gives
big of North Power 10, you

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5905-1
00:27:15.741 --> 00:27:18.672
cannot deny the fact it is still
correct, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5910-0
00:27:19.162 --> 00:27:19.602
Just no.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5916-0
00:27:19.612 --> 00:27:20.662
Did all of you get this point?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5918-0
00:27:21.922 --> 00:27:22.212
Yes.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5946-0
00:27:22.222 --> 00:27:25.073
No, and a lot of these entrances
right in gate exams and all

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5946-1
00:27:25.073 --> 00:27:27.644
that, you know, people get
confused with these type of

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5946-2
00:27:27.644 --> 00:27:28.112
questions.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5961-0
00:27:28.162 --> 00:27:31.470
Yeah, you should not get
confused while doing algorithm

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5961-1
00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:32.002
analysis.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/5971-0
00:27:32.192 --> 00:27:35.042
We should be as tight as
possible, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6012-0
00:27:35.102 --> 00:27:38.613
But this is not stopping that if
someone abbrev gives you that

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6012-1
00:27:38.613 --> 00:27:41.845
equation and gives that big of
North power under it, then

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6012-2
00:27:41.845 --> 00:27:44.632
npower 100 of course has N power
four also right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6017-0
00:27:44.642 --> 00:27:45.302
So this is also correct.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6021-0
00:27:47.312 --> 00:27:47.652
Cool.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6032-0
00:27:47.662 --> 00:27:50.402
That being said, we will try to
break some myths here.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6034-0
00:27:50.452 --> 00:27:50.962
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6061-0
00:27:51.072 --> 00:27:53.924
So there is a simple loop here
which starts from one, goes all

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6061-1
00:27:53.924 --> 00:27:56.142
the way till less than or equal
to north I plus.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6073-0
00:27:56.152 --> 00:27:58.933
Plus it has a body which is
going to take some constant

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6073-1
00:27:58.933 --> 00:27:59.182
time.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6083-0
00:27:59.592 --> 00:28:01.372
So what will be the worst case
of this?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6088-0
00:28:03.632 --> 00:28:03.862
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6098-0
00:28:03.872 --> 00:28:05.822
What will be big off in this
case?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6110-0
00:28:05.832 --> 00:28:07.282
It will be in right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6131-0
00:28:07.292 --> 00:28:10.534
It executes the end times, so
it'll be some constant into N

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6131-1
00:28:10.534 --> 00:28:12.642
constant is, you know cancelled
right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6145-0
00:28:12.652 --> 00:28:15.152
So what you get is north for
some math levels.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6154-0
00:28:15.162 --> 00:28:18.002
You can also evaluate a loop
like this, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6170-0
00:28:18.012 --> 00:28:21.455
You can start from the you know
lower limit and this is your

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6170-1
00:28:21.455 --> 00:28:22.132
upper limit.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6202-0
00:28:22.642 --> 00:28:26.151
This is the body of the loop
which is 1 and evaluating this

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6202-1
00:28:26.151 --> 00:28:29.602
summation operation is nothing
but upper limit minus lower

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6202-2
00:28:29.602 --> 00:28:30.772
limit plus the body.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6210-0
00:28:31.262 --> 00:28:33.032
This got cancelled and N is your
answer.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6218-0
00:28:33.382 --> 00:28:35.052
So there is a single loop like
this.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6239-0
00:28:35.062 --> 00:28:39.095
What is the complexity yen if
you have two like 2 loops like

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6239-1
00:28:39.095 --> 00:28:41.012
this, what is the complexity?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6243-0
00:28:41.542 --> 00:28:42.422
Just look at this code.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6264-0
00:28:44.742 --> 00:28:47.877
There is a loop I there is a
loop J within that and then

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6264-1
00:28:47.877 --> 00:28:49.472
there is something called as.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6270-0
00:28:51.712 --> 00:28:53.292
Constant time, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6295-0
00:28:56.482 --> 00:28:59.850
Yeah, the the point here is that
so that you again come back and

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6295-1
00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:01.042
watch the videos, yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6313-0
00:29:03.302 --> 00:29:06.269
Pull this is going to take 10
times and this is going to take

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6313-1
00:29:06.269 --> 00:29:06.652
N times.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6341-0
00:29:06.752 --> 00:29:10.088
This is going to take a
constant, so that is nothing but

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6341-1
00:29:10.088 --> 00:29:12.312
C into and into N which is CN
square.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6355-0
00:29:12.472 --> 00:29:15.194
You can ignore the constant, so
North Square is your order of

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6355-1
00:29:15.194 --> 00:29:15.502
growth.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6363-0
00:29:15.592 --> 00:29:16.362
Put it in Pico.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6368-0
00:29:17.282 --> 00:29:17.952
That is your answer.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6376-0
00:29:19.112 --> 00:29:20.202
Well, all of you got it right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6379-0
00:29:20.212 --> 00:29:20.722
Very good.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6389-0
00:29:21.512 --> 00:29:23.142
So if there are three loops,
what is the answer?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6406-0
00:29:25.552 --> 00:29:28.763
If there are three loops, nested
loops, one within another within

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6406-1
00:29:28.763 --> 00:29:29.152
another.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6413-0
00:29:30.322 --> 00:29:32.002
OK, we'll come back to this.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6417-0
00:29:32.012 --> 00:29:32.552
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6420-0
00:29:32.642 --> 00:29:33.512
If there are five loops.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6422-0
00:29:35.832 --> 00:29:35.992
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6431-0
00:29:38.062 --> 00:29:39.012
Prem, Zimbra and others.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6435-0
00:29:39.022 --> 00:29:40.222
If there are five loops, OK.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6448-0
00:29:42.232 --> 00:29:44.419
Cool, you're getting the
answers, but we will come to

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6448-1
00:29:44.419 --> 00:29:44.622
this.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6452-0
00:29:44.632 --> 00:29:44.802
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6461-0
00:29:44.812 --> 00:29:46.382
We will come to this point in a
moment.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6471-0
00:29:47.482 --> 00:29:49.472
Well, let's also look at if L
statements.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6491-0
00:29:49.562 --> 00:29:52.429
Yeah, if there are, if L
statements, then how do you

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6491-1
00:29:52.429 --> 00:29:54.972
calculate the worst case
complexity in simple?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6507-0
00:29:54.982 --> 00:29:58.062
What you will do is you will
treat both of the parts as

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6507-1
00:29:58.062 --> 00:29:58.832
separate code.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6523-0
00:29:58.982 --> 00:30:01.451
You will try to, you know, get
the complexity of the if

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6523-1
00:30:01.451 --> 00:30:01.892
condition.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6539-0
00:30:02.162 --> 00:30:05.209
You will get it for the else
condition and then you will take

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6539-1
00:30:05.209 --> 00:30:06.192
whichever is larger.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6549-0
00:30:08.012 --> 00:30:09.582
Yeah, JAGDISH, you wanted me to
go back.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6552-0
00:30:09.592 --> 00:30:10.452
Yeah, real quick.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6557-0
00:30:13.802 --> 00:30:14.072
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6560-0
00:30:14.082 --> 00:30:14.972
You had anything or?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6566-0
00:30:17.462 --> 00:30:18.002
Simple stuff.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6570-0
00:30:18.012 --> 00:30:18.602
There is a loop.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6587-0
00:30:18.612 --> 00:30:21.412
There's a loop inside that there
is a constant statement pool.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6595-0
00:30:22.602 --> 00:30:24.312
So far I felt what is the
concept?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6601-0
00:30:24.322 --> 00:30:25.232
You have some if code.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6617-0
00:30:25.242 --> 00:30:28.212
You have some else code if this
if is true this will execute.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6621-0
00:30:28.262 --> 00:30:29.472
Otherwise this will execute.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6640-0
00:30:29.742 --> 00:30:33.729
So what we do is we analyze both
of them and take whichever is

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6640-1
00:30:33.729 --> 00:30:34.172
larger.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6677-0
00:30:34.972 --> 00:30:38.738
So in this case this 8th part is
just a constant, just one return

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6677-1
00:30:38.738 --> 00:30:42.390
statement is there, whereas in
else part you have some for loop

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6677-2
00:30:42.390 --> 00:30:44.102
right which runs for end time.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6684-0
00:30:44.212 --> 00:30:46.322
Then there is some constants
here, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6695-0
00:30:46.532 --> 00:30:48.602
So this part is a constant C1.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6706-0
00:30:49.092 --> 00:30:52.122
This part is having a constant
plus constant plus again.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6710-0
00:30:52.852 --> 00:30:54.262
So all this is eliminated.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6723-0
00:30:54.452 --> 00:30:56.982
So this part is when this part
is a constant.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6744-0
00:30:57.052 --> 00:31:00.882
So what can a comment about the
complete complexity out of a

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6744-1
00:31:00.882 --> 00:31:03.142
constant and then who's larger
yen?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6758-0
00:31:03.512 --> 00:31:05.122
So I will have it as we go off
yet.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6770-0
00:31:05.892 --> 00:31:09.581
So it feels meaning analyze both
the part and take the largest 1

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6770-1
00:31:09.581 --> 00:31:09.922
right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6782-0
00:31:11.852 --> 00:31:13.902
And now coming to logarithmic
complexity.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6797-0
00:31:13.912 --> 00:31:16.211
Yeah, Rajesh and others were
having, you know, asking them

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6797-1
00:31:16.211 --> 00:31:16.562
examples.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6829-0
00:31:16.952 --> 00:31:20.175
We will actually look at this in
the whole course here and there,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6829-1
00:31:20.175 --> 00:31:23.154
but just just to give you some,
you know, motivation towards

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6829-2
00:31:23.154 --> 00:31:24.082
what is this login?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6831-0
00:31:24.232 --> 00:31:24.482
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6839-0
00:31:24.492 --> 00:31:26.762
How does suddenly login come up
right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6842-0
00:31:27.642 --> 00:31:27.852
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6878-0
00:31:27.862 --> 00:31:31.342
So it'll be this slide you mean,
so don't go to the intricacies

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6878-1
00:31:31.342 --> 00:31:34.876
of these things you can do later
also, but the whole point is if

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6878-2
00:31:34.876 --> 00:31:36.072
there is if else code.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6880-0
00:31:36.562 --> 00:31:37.052
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6915-0
00:31:37.562 --> 00:31:41.057
If also you have to analyze
separately whatever if code is

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6915-1
00:31:41.057 --> 00:31:44.611
there else also you have to
analyze and then you'll have to

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6915-2
00:31:44.611 --> 00:31:47.692
compare which of them is a
larger complexity right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6923-0
00:31:47.702 --> 00:31:48.932
That will become your final
answer.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6927-0
00:31:50.462 --> 00:31:51.092
Yeah, makes sense.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6964-0
00:31:51.102 --> 00:31:54.100
Are we in this case it was just
a constant, but here in this

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6964-1
00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:57.049
there was a loop, so this was
becoming a yen and then there

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6964-2
00:31:57.049 --> 00:31:59.212
were some constants here
constant constant.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6982-0
00:31:59.602 --> 00:32:03.852
So this total became C + C + N
and this was just a constant.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6988-0
00:32:04.182 --> 00:32:05.422
So totally it became, yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/6990-0
00:32:07.092 --> 00:32:07.322
No.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7003-0
00:32:07.332 --> 00:32:10.582
What is this login right log
complexity in the chart?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7012-0
00:32:10.592 --> 00:32:12.722
Also there was log N, log N and
all that.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7018-0
00:32:12.772 --> 00:32:13.752
So what is this login?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7061-0
00:32:15.172 --> 00:32:19.493
So an algorithm is big O of log
N that is worst case complexity

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7061-1
00:32:19.493 --> 00:32:23.679
is log N if it takes constant
time to cut the problem size by

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7061-2
00:32:23.679 --> 00:32:26.312
a fraction, and usually it is by
half.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7069-0
00:32:27.432 --> 00:32:29.562
As an example, let us consider
the following program.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7075-0
00:32:30.982 --> 00:32:31.632
Look at this loop.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7100-0
00:32:32.312 --> 00:32:36.421
It starts from one, it goes all
the way till yen, but I'm not

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7100-1
00:32:36.421 --> 00:32:37.482
going each step.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7118-0
00:32:37.572 --> 00:32:42.064
Instead of going each step like
this like you know from one to

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7118-1
00:32:42.064 --> 00:32:43.062
3/4 and so on.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7138-0
00:32:43.412 --> 00:32:47.284
What I'm doing is I have I equal
to I into two meaning how is it

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7138-1
00:32:47.284 --> 00:32:47.642
going?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7148-0
00:32:47.652 --> 00:32:50.102
How are the steps now this one?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7185-0
00:32:52.022 --> 00:32:58.194
From one I go to two, then
directly I go to four, then I go

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7185-1
00:32:58.194 --> 00:33:03.852
to 8, then I go to 1632 right
64128 two 56512 and one.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7194-0
00:33:03.942 --> 00:33:04.802
So I'm doubling it.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7201-0
00:33:06.612 --> 00:33:07.902
So which of them is faster?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7223-0
00:33:07.912 --> 00:33:11.610
Do you feel there is a step
where a kid goes step by step,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7223-1
00:33:11.610 --> 00:33:13.302
step by step till the roof?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7235-0
00:33:13.462 --> 00:33:16.575
There's another grid who's just
jumping and doubling every

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7235-1
00:33:16.575 --> 00:33:16.892
steps.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7241-0
00:33:17.132 --> 00:33:18.872
Who will reach the roof first?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7244-0
00:33:20.902 --> 00:33:21.282
Public.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7251-0
00:33:21.712 --> 00:33:22.872
That's exactly log in for you.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7270-0
00:33:23.762 --> 00:33:27.127
Yeah, you cannot get simpler
than this, but simply means in

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7270-1
00:33:27.127 --> 00:33:27.912
another angle.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7287-0
00:33:28.502 --> 00:33:32.329
Whenever you cut down the
problem size, you're solving the

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7287-1
00:33:32.329 --> 00:33:33.302
problem faster.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7291-0
00:33:34.342 --> 00:33:34.652
Correct.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7299-0
00:33:34.662 --> 00:33:36.692
Meaning you are still reaching
the destination here.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7318-0
00:33:36.702 --> 00:33:42.016
Here also, you're reaching the
destination and this doubling is

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7318-1
00:33:42.016 --> 00:33:44.922
not affecting your solution
right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7331-0
00:33:45.012 --> 00:33:46.682
Is equal to I + 2 will not be.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7337-0
00:33:46.692 --> 00:33:48.462
Again, you know logarithmic
right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7354-0
00:33:48.532 --> 00:33:51.789
You are still going to, you
know, just skip some steps, but

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7354-1
00:33:51.789 --> 00:33:53.092
you are not logarithmic.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7368-0
00:33:53.232 --> 00:33:56.535
Logarithmic, meaning you have to
cut down the problem size by

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7368-1
00:33:56.535 --> 00:33:56.802
half.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7387-0
00:33:58.172 --> 00:34:03.102
If you do I + 2, you're just
going to 4681012 and so on.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7416-0
00:34:03.112 --> 00:34:07.276
You're not doubling, but here in
this case from 16 you will go

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7416-1
00:34:07.276 --> 00:34:09.722
directly to 30, two 64128 and so
on.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7432-0
00:34:10.152 --> 00:34:14.662
So you are skipping down or
cutting down the problem, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7459-0
00:34:14.772 --> 00:34:18.256
Whenever you cut down the
problem size by doing all these

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7459-1
00:34:18.256 --> 00:34:22.040
types of you know tricks, then
it simply means that you are in

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7459-2
00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:23.422
logarithmic complexity.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7462-0
00:34:25.262 --> 00:34:25.642
Yes, no.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7470-0
00:34:25.652 --> 00:34:26.832
Is it making sense for all of
you?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7479-0
00:34:30.792 --> 00:34:32.702
Double the time cube of two
works.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7486-0
00:34:32.712 --> 00:34:32.862
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7489-0
00:34:32.872 --> 00:34:33.692
Then it also works.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7495-0
00:34:33.702 --> 00:34:33.962
Yeah, you.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7503-0
00:34:33.972 --> 00:34:35.322
I can have into three and so on.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7527-0
00:34:35.332 --> 00:34:38.360
Also in that case you are
cutting down the problem by

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7527-1
00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:40.042
price and not just half right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7543-0
00:34:40.052 --> 00:34:43.742
But usually in computing we cut
it down by half or two.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7548-0
00:34:45.602 --> 00:34:46.782
So when will this loop end?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7571-0
00:34:46.792 --> 00:34:50.518
So there is also some small
theory on how you got this log

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7571-1
00:34:50.518 --> 00:34:51.592
north right here.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7580-0
00:34:51.602 --> 00:34:53.622
You saw that it was my into two.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7589-0
00:34:54.492 --> 00:34:56.822
And how does that translate to
log in, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7655-0
00:34:56.832 --> 00:35:00.000
So that part I've just explained
here, this is not of too much

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7655-1
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.918
relevance, but for some math
lovers you can actually, you

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7655-2
00:35:02.918 --> 00:35:05.885
know, look at this later,
meaning you can substitute the I

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7655-3
00:35:05.885 --> 00:35:09.154
values and you can see when will
this loop end and at that stage

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7655-4
00:35:09.154 --> 00:35:12.122
if you just take log both sides
you will get it as log in.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7664-0
00:35:13.192 --> 00:35:14.582
Yeah, it it means log base 2.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7668-0
00:35:14.652 --> 00:35:17.302
Correct E Please repeat once.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7675-0
00:35:17.312 --> 00:35:18.712
Uh, the previous slide, you
mean?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7682-0
00:35:20.192 --> 00:35:21.242
Yeah, I would again urge.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7694-0
00:35:21.832 --> 00:35:23.952
Please spare 200% while in the
class.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7708-0
00:35:23.962 --> 00:35:27.342
Yeah, otherwise will be just
stuck to 1 slide right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7721-0
00:35:27.352 --> 00:35:29.250
And of course you can always,
you know, go back to the

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7721-1
00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:29.802
recordings also.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7744-0
00:35:30.352 --> 00:35:34.115
So if else was a very simple
concept, whatever is in the if

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7744-1
00:35:34.115 --> 00:35:36.122
body, right, analyze that right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7753-0
00:35:36.452 --> 00:35:37.562
Let me just make it simpler.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7759-0
00:35:37.572 --> 00:35:38.632
Just forget this for a minute.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7786-0
00:35:40.782 --> 00:35:45.393
That is, if part there is L part
and at least this separately,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7786-1
00:35:45.393 --> 00:35:49.052
unless this separately, take
whichever is larger.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7789-0
00:35:50.242 --> 00:35:53.072
That is your complexity well.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7794-0
00:35:55.572 --> 00:35:56.262
Not this one.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7799-0
00:35:56.272 --> 00:35:57.332
Which one then group?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7801-0
00:35:58.652 --> 00:35:58.862
Cool.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7820-0
00:35:58.872 --> 00:36:01.294
Let's you know you can watch the
recording and post it in the

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7820-1
00:36:01.294 --> 00:36:02.622
discussion if there is
something.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7832-0
00:36:02.892 --> 00:36:06.690
Yeah, but now all of you got
what is logarithmic complexity,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7832-1
00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:07.002
yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7835-0
00:36:10.072 --> 00:36:10.402
Yes.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7852-0
00:36:10.412 --> 00:36:14.982
No, it is as simple as whenever
you cut down the problem size.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7859-0
00:36:16.062 --> 00:36:17.152
Yeah, that that proof is fine.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7863-0
00:36:17.162 --> 00:36:17.652
Yeah. Summit.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7871-0
00:36:17.662 --> 00:36:19.332
Don't worry too much about it.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7892-0
00:36:19.542 --> 00:36:22.236
Whenever you are cutting down
the problem size, it means you

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7892-1
00:36:22.236 --> 00:36:24.622
are falling in this bucket of
logarithmic complexity.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7903-0
00:36:26.102 --> 00:36:28.592
Yeah, yeah, that is also valid
notation, correct?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7916-0
00:36:28.662 --> 00:36:31.472
In that case, Rakesh, it is not
taking log N complexity.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7928-0
00:36:31.802 --> 00:36:35.952
It is taking yen times the log N
complexity that is also correct.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7944-0
00:36:35.962 --> 00:36:38.442
There are a lot of algorithms
who take log N log N.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7953-0
00:36:39.912 --> 00:36:41.912
Yeah, we will look at it when
the time comes.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7957-0
00:36:41.922 --> 00:36:42.092
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7969-0
00:36:42.102 --> 00:36:44.441
When we analyze some algorithms,
you might come across this as

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7969-1
00:36:44.441 --> 00:36:45.072
the final answer.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7972-0
00:36:47.062 --> 00:36:47.672
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7979-0
00:36:48.122 --> 00:36:49.312
OK, it's time for you now.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/7990-0
00:36:49.322 --> 00:36:51.332
Yeah, there are a couple of
codes now, right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8003-0
00:36:51.702 --> 00:36:55.352
So you will let me know what is
the time complexity of this.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8021-0
00:37:03.572 --> 00:37:07.280
Yeah, there is a loop within a
loop within a loop and then some

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8021-1
00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:07.802
constant.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8033-0
00:37:07.992 --> 00:37:11.612
Yeah, Ncube, a lot of people N
cube, OK.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8049-0
00:37:15.312 --> 00:37:17.931
I'm still hoping for that one
person who will give the correct

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8049-1
00:37:17.931 --> 00:37:18.222
answer.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8058-0
00:37:18.272 --> 00:37:20.942
Yeah, we'll be Krishna is right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8071-0
00:37:21.372 --> 00:37:25.562
And let's see why here I have K
is equal to K into two.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8093-0
00:37:25.852 --> 00:37:32.338
So is this log this thought this
is a constant. This one is log N

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8093-1
00:37:32.338 --> 00:37:34.402
and here you have an.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8098-0
00:37:34.412 --> 00:37:34.902
Here you have a.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8100-0
00:37:34.912 --> 00:37:36.392
Yeah, right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8118-0
00:37:36.922 --> 00:37:41.219
So the complexities yen, square
log north and constant constant

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8118-1
00:37:41.219 --> 00:37:42.562
even ignored, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8132-0
00:37:42.572 --> 00:37:47.124
It was not N cube because you
should give importance to this

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8132-1
00:37:47.124 --> 00:37:47.572
right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8156-0
00:37:47.732 --> 00:37:52.350
It was not K plus plus it was K
is equal to K into two, meaning

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8156-1
00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:55.092
this whole loop is just log in
right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8158-0
00:37:56.552 --> 00:37:56.832
Yes.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8166-0
00:37:56.842 --> 00:37:57.772
No, all of you got this.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8173-0
00:37:57.782 --> 00:37:59.402
You know the derivations are not
important.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8175-0
00:37:59.412 --> 00:37:59.682
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8213-0
00:37:59.692 --> 00:38:02.861
So you just, you know, try to
keep putting your eye values and

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8213-1
00:38:02.861 --> 00:38:05.930
at a point when you know you
take log, it will become log in

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8213-2
00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:07.942
the other side will just get
cancelled.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8218-0
00:38:08.472 --> 00:38:09.542
Yeah, don't worry about that.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8225-0
00:38:09.552 --> 00:38:10.982
Yeah, that's not important.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8252-0
00:38:12.562 --> 00:38:15.774
Just remember that whenever
you're cutting down a problem

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8252-1
00:38:15.774 --> 00:38:19.152
size like this, you are falling
in the bucket of log N cool.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8257-0
00:38:20.672 --> 00:38:21.242
Is this clear?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8261-0
00:38:21.252 --> 00:38:21.822
All of you.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8265-0
00:38:21.912 --> 00:38:23.472
It was not N cube, yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8273-0
00:38:26.812 --> 00:38:28.362
What about this part of code?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8284-0
00:38:28.452 --> 00:38:31.912
Yeah, yeah, that is still N
money content.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8311-0
00:38:31.922 --> 00:38:35.335
The the third part where you're
doing I + + J plus plus that is

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8311-1
00:38:35.335 --> 00:38:37.202
what matters, not the middle
part.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8315-0
00:38:37.402 --> 00:38:38.662
Middle part is just comparison.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8324-0
00:38:40.962 --> 00:38:41.922
Yeah, it will not reduce.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8342-0
00:38:41.932 --> 00:38:45.112
Yeah, that is still treated as
yen when in itself is Infinity.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8351-0
00:38:45.122 --> 00:38:48.542
Infinity by half is also
Infinity, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8353-0
00:38:48.792 --> 00:38:49.382
N square.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8360-0
00:38:49.442 --> 00:38:50.662
Yeah, a lot of you.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8362-0
00:38:50.672 --> 00:38:51.142
N square.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8368-0
00:38:51.152 --> 00:38:51.842
Yeah, very good.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8372-0
00:38:51.852 --> 00:38:53.982
All of you are wrong, yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8380-0
00:38:56.262 --> 00:38:58.202
Carefully observe this code,
yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8421-0
00:39:00.922 --> 00:39:04.865
There is a constant time that is
just return statement and then

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8421-1
00:39:04.865 --> 00:39:08.808
you add this outer loop which is
going to execute and times and

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8421-2
00:39:08.808 --> 00:39:12.136
then there is this inner loop
which is having a break

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8421-3
00:39:12.136 --> 00:39:12.752
statement.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8424-0
00:39:13.182 --> 00:39:13.492
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8436-0
00:39:13.502 --> 00:39:16.552
Do you clearly see this when Jay
is equal to 1?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8442-0
00:39:16.562 --> 00:39:17.412
It will come inside.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8449-0
00:39:17.422 --> 00:39:18.772
It will print a star.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8463-0
00:39:18.882 --> 00:39:22.076
It will break break, meaning it
will come out of this loop

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8463-1
00:39:22.076 --> 00:39:22.672
completely.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8504-0
00:39:22.882 --> 00:39:26.888
It will go back to my is equal
to two go for two it will again

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8504-1
00:39:26.888 --> 00:39:31.021
go in J will become one again I
again reinitialize is equal to 1

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8504-2
00:39:31.021 --> 00:39:33.692
it will print a star it will
again break.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8519-0
00:39:35.002 --> 00:39:38.692
So this for loop is not even
acting as a loop, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8557-0
00:39:38.702 --> 00:39:41.392
Every time J will be one
immediately it'll come and print

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8557-1
00:39:41.392 --> 00:39:44.128
and you are not going to J equal
to two J, equal to three,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8557-2
00:39:44.128 --> 00:39:47.050
etcetera, because immediately
after this break line I'm coming

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8557-3
00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:47.792
out of the loop.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8569-0
00:39:48.362 --> 00:39:50.732
So this loop is not even acting
as a loop.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8588-0
00:39:51.452 --> 00:39:55.940
It is as good as not having this
loop at all and just having this

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8588-1
00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:56.892
print correct.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8594-0
00:39:57.302 --> 00:39:58.532
So what is the complexity then?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8625-0
00:40:01.182 --> 00:40:05.706
It is just big off yen, but most
of you had told N Square right

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8625-1
00:40:05.706 --> 00:40:08.392
and now I lost you the same
question.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8628-0
00:40:08.542 --> 00:40:09.772
I have 3 loops.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8634-0
00:40:10.042 --> 00:40:10.952
What is the complexity?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8637-0
00:40:13.232 --> 00:40:13.382
I'll.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8639-0
00:40:13.392 --> 00:40:13.722
I'll back.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8657-0
00:40:13.732 --> 00:40:17.362
I'd asked you and a lot of you
told NQ when I had asked about 5

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8657-1
00:40:17.362 --> 00:40:17.702
loops.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8664-0
00:40:17.712 --> 00:40:18.882
You all told N Power five.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8668-0
00:40:19.692 --> 00:40:20.342
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8678-0
00:40:20.532 --> 00:40:23.442
When someone asks you about, you
know there are three loops.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8688-0
00:40:23.452 --> 00:40:24.822
What is the complexity and so
on?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8698-0
00:40:25.032 --> 00:40:27.802
You should immediately deny it
and ask them.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8702-0
00:40:27.872 --> 00:40:28.942
You show me the code?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8705-0
00:40:29.512 --> 00:40:30.662
Yeah, exactly.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8712-0
00:40:30.672 --> 00:40:31.762
Yeah, Bharathi.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8721-0
00:40:31.772 --> 00:40:32.762
Same with all of you are right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8724-0
00:40:33.482 --> 00:40:33.852
Right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8730-0
00:40:34.102 --> 00:40:35.112
Depends on the code.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8759-0
00:40:35.462 --> 00:40:38.676
A lot of authors still have this
mistake, they just generalized

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8759-1
00:40:38.676 --> 00:40:41.740
things, telling that you know if
there are two loops it is N

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8759-2
00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:42.092
square.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8780-0
00:40:42.102 --> 00:40:45.587
If it is 5 loop, it is North
power five and so on, which is

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8780-1
00:40:45.587 --> 00:40:47.272
absolutely, you know, insane.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8789-0
00:40:47.542 --> 00:40:50.652
It all depends upon the body of
them.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8813-0
00:40:50.742 --> 00:40:54.580
If they have some breaks like
this, or if I, you know, have a

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8813-1
00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:57.862
Live loop inside them, right,
what about that right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8821-0
00:40:57.872 --> 00:40:58.972
Nobody talks about that, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8843-0
00:40:58.982 --> 00:41:01.246
If there's a for loop, and if
there's a while loop inside that

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8843-1
00:41:01.246 --> 00:41:02.612
for loop, that is also a loop,
right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8867-0
00:41:03.342 --> 00:41:05.795
So I should not generalize
things, telling that if these

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8867-1
00:41:05.795 --> 00:41:07.732
many loops are there, this is
it, and so on.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8881-0
00:41:07.962 --> 00:41:11.196
And if I have continue, break
and all that, it can alter the

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8881-1
00:41:11.196 --> 00:41:11.832
flow, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8903-0
00:41:12.062 --> 00:41:15.350
So the whole crux of this
exercise, what we did is you

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8903-1
00:41:15.350 --> 00:41:17.802
should not come to such way
conclusions.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8925-0
00:41:18.692 --> 00:41:22.385
You should inspect code line by
line and then take an informed

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8925-1
00:41:22.385 --> 00:41:24.672
decision as to what is the
complexity.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8935-0
00:41:26.002 --> 00:41:28.842
Was it clear guys for all of
you? Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8940-0
00:41:31.042 --> 00:41:31.322
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8945-0
00:41:31.332 --> 00:41:32.272
2nd Loop also runs.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8966-0
00:41:32.282 --> 00:41:34.820
If this break was not there,
then it would have run then it

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8966-1
00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:35.962
it should have run for end.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8979-0
00:41:35.972 --> 00:41:38.255
This would have run for end and
total complexity of drive in

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8979-1
00:41:38.255 --> 00:41:38.742
North Square.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8989-0
00:41:41.902 --> 00:41:43.532
So some quick definitions for
you.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/8994-0
00:41:43.882 --> 00:41:45.012
Linear complexity.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9019-0
00:41:45.022 --> 00:41:48.541
It is nothing but the ones that
are having the final answer as

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9019-1
00:41:48.541 --> 00:41:50.832
yen, quadratic meaning and
square right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9052-0
00:41:50.842 --> 00:41:55.034
The time taken is proportional
to the square of the input,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9052-1
00:41:55.034 --> 00:41:58.870
meaning N square that is North
Square right should be

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9052-2
00:41:58.870 --> 00:42:02.352
complexity N cube and this is
nothing but log N.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9055-0
00:42:04.222 --> 00:42:04.592
Right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9070-0
00:42:05.122 --> 00:42:07.472
So yes, you know the same word
equivalents to it.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9090-0
00:42:07.482 --> 00:42:10.321
So that you don't get confused,
someone can just tell that I've

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9090-1
00:42:10.321 --> 00:42:12.672
analyzed it and my final answer
is cubic complexity.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9099-0
00:42:13.062 --> 00:42:15.872
So what they mean is actually
enqueue, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9113-0
00:42:18.932 --> 00:42:23.232
Cool, but now let's also talk
about the type of algorithms,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9113-1
00:42:23.232 --> 00:42:23.662
right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9121-0
00:42:25.682 --> 00:42:27.052
There are two types, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9128-0
00:42:27.302 --> 00:42:29.372
One is iterative and one is
recursion.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9131-0
00:42:31.432 --> 00:42:31.592
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9138-0
00:42:33.362 --> 00:42:34.512
Do you have any idea about this?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9158-0
00:42:37.712 --> 00:42:40.268
Why do you write as we go of
North Square rather than only N

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9158-1
00:42:40.268 --> 00:42:40.562
square?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9166-0
00:42:40.572 --> 00:42:42.502
Because we are representing time
complexity.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9184-0
00:42:42.832 --> 00:42:46.571
Yeah, when you just write N
square like this, this is not

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9184-1
00:42:46.571 --> 00:42:49.472
representing the worst case
behavior, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9209-0
00:42:49.482 --> 00:42:54.602
Only when I put it as we go, it
means that in the worst case N

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9209-1
00:42:54.602 --> 00:42:57.122
squared is my complexity right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9216-0
00:42:58.392 --> 00:42:59.662
Is this clear, Amit?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9242-0
00:43:01.082 --> 00:43:04.339
If I just put an answer as this
to FN is equal to North Square,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9242-1
00:43:04.339 --> 00:43:06.782
this means the order of growth
is North Square.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9265-0
00:43:08.032 --> 00:43:11.268
I'm not indicating that worst
case, so only when I put it

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9265-1
00:43:11.268 --> 00:43:12.942
inside big or Omega and so on.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9283-0
00:43:13.252 --> 00:43:16.143
I know in what case this N
square is the complexity, so

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9283-1
00:43:16.143 --> 00:43:18.002
that is why I'm putting that big
O.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9287-0
00:43:21.082 --> 00:43:21.352
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9296-0
00:43:21.362 --> 00:43:22.342
Is it clear for all of you?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9325-0
00:43:23.722 --> 00:43:26.460
Yeah, across the code will be
seeing some examples that if

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9325-1
00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:29.291
yeah, so first two classes we
are just, you know, uh, taking

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9325-2
00:43:29.291 --> 00:43:30.452
some motivation for this.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9328-0
00:43:32.962 --> 00:43:33.452
Cool.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9341-0
00:43:33.792 --> 00:43:37.332
So in a Broadway we can write
algorithms in two ways.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9350-0
00:43:37.842 --> 00:43:39.952
One is iteration, one is
recursion.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9358-0
00:43:40.482 --> 00:43:42.922
Iteration means you are using
loops, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9398-0
00:43:42.932 --> 00:43:47.115
You're using some loops like for
loop while loop and so on,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9398-1
00:43:47.115 --> 00:43:51.158
whereas recursion is another
technique where an algorithm

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9398-2
00:43:51.158 --> 00:43:55.481
calls itself or a function calls
itself again and again until

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9398-3
00:43:55.481 --> 00:43:57.642
certain criteria is met, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9404-0
00:43:57.652 --> 00:43:58.622
That is also another technique.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9409-0
00:44:00.462 --> 00:44:01.072
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9434-0
00:44:01.302 --> 00:44:04.820
The process in which a function
calls itself directly or

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9434-1
00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:08.709
indirectly is called recursion,
and the corresponding function

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9434-2
00:44:08.709 --> 00:44:11.302
is called as a recursive
function, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9467-0
00:44:11.782 --> 00:44:16.144
So define a procedure P that is
allowed to make calls to itself,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9467-1
00:44:16.144 --> 00:44:19.970
provided those calls of P are
solving the subproblems of

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9467-2
00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:21.312
smaller size, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9483-0
00:44:22.582 --> 00:44:24.807
So what are the conditions for
recursive procedure or a

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9483-1
00:44:24.807 --> 00:44:25.602
recursive algorithm?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9498-0
00:44:26.422 --> 00:44:29.710
It should always define a base
case and what is the base case

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9498-1
00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:29.922
now?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9521-0
00:44:30.662 --> 00:44:34.680
A base case is a small sized
problem which can be solved by

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9521-1
00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:38.162
the algorithm directly without
using any recursion.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9528-0
00:44:39.012 --> 00:44:40.402
Yeah, we will see some examples.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9538-0
00:44:40.412 --> 00:44:42.982
Yeah, it will be even more
clear, right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9542-0
00:44:43.152 --> 00:44:44.182
There are a couple of questions.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9549-0
00:44:44.192 --> 00:44:45.152
Let me just look at that.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9551-0
00:44:45.162 --> 00:44:45.502
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9584-0
00:44:45.552 --> 00:44:48.317
So till money content was just
responses because I had a

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9584-1
00:44:48.317 --> 00:44:51.276
question N square log N can
can't we neglect log in and take

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9584-2
00:44:51.276 --> 00:44:53.022
consideration of North Square
only?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9590-0
00:44:53.412 --> 00:44:54.122
No, no, no.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9599-0
00:44:54.132 --> 00:44:55.632
We should we should not be doing
that.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9612-0
00:44:55.892 --> 00:45:03.932
But technically speaking, yeah,
out of this N square log in.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9641-0
00:45:04.462 --> 00:45:07.059
I mean, if you feel that, you
know, I can just ignore that and

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9641-1
00:45:07.059 --> 00:45:09.573
square and just have log in or
ignore that log in and have N

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9641-2
00:45:09.573 --> 00:45:09.862
square.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9651-0
00:45:12.192 --> 00:45:12.332
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9690-0
00:45:13.982 --> 00:45:19.048
If you had N square plus log N,
you can ignore this and make it

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9690-1
00:45:19.048 --> 00:45:24.115
as N square, whereas here it is
multiply right you're telling N

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9690-2
00:45:24.115 --> 00:45:28.152
square times log N is your final
complexity right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9702-0
00:45:28.162 --> 00:45:30.532
If you ignore this, then you are
completely messing it up.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9706-0
00:45:30.912 --> 00:45:31.392
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9738-0
00:45:31.482 --> 00:45:35.454
If you had only addition then
you can you know that whole rule

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9738-1
00:45:35.454 --> 00:45:39.047
was about ignoring the lower
order term when it is lower

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9738-2
00:45:39.047 --> 00:45:40.182
order term, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9749-0
00:45:40.192 --> 00:45:42.102
So in this this full thing is
one term.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9767-0
00:45:42.352 --> 00:45:44.663
Yeah, you are actually
dissecting this and trying to,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9767-1
00:45:44.663 --> 00:45:46.332
you know, ignore this, which is
wrong.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9779-0
00:45:47.412 --> 00:45:48.332
Yeah, because you got this.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9795-0
00:45:49.502 --> 00:45:52.202
It was N square plus log N you
could have very well done that.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9813-0
00:45:52.212 --> 00:45:55.075
You can cancel the log and N
square will be the answer,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9813-1
00:45:55.075 --> 00:45:56.712
whereas this is one term itself.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9819-0
00:45:56.722 --> 00:45:57.692
Yeah, you should not do that.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9822-0
00:46:00.062 --> 00:46:00.392
Cool.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9831-0
00:46:00.642 --> 00:46:02.462
So let's take some examples of
this recursion.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9835-0
00:46:03.372 --> 00:46:03.702
Let's go.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9850-0
00:46:03.712 --> 00:46:06.270
Recursive algorithm will look
like this if the problem is

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9850-1
00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:07.682
small enough, solve it directly.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9871-0
00:46:07.972 --> 00:46:11.927
Otherwise, break into one or
more smaller subproblems, solve

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9871-1
00:46:11.927 --> 00:46:14.002
each problem recursively, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9884-0
00:46:14.012 --> 00:46:15.932
Meaning again and again try to
do the same thing.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9893-0
00:46:17.722 --> 00:46:19.512
The requirements of a recursive
solution.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9913-0
00:46:19.852 --> 00:46:23.895
There should be at least one
small case that can be solved

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9913-1
00:46:23.895 --> 00:46:26.842
directly and a way of breaking
them right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9925-0
00:46:26.972 --> 00:46:29.142
One or more smaller sub problems
of the same kind.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9936-0
00:46:29.232 --> 00:46:30.592
We'll take an example at EB
Clear.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9948-0
00:46:31.512 --> 00:46:33.742
We want to find out the length
of a string.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9967-0
00:46:34.312 --> 00:46:37.535
I want to know in a name or you
know how many characters are

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9967-1
00:46:37.535 --> 00:46:38.222
there, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9985-0
00:46:38.232 --> 00:46:41.672
For example, the same name you
know, because if I take what is

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/9985-1
00:46:41.672 --> 00:46:43.092
the length of this string?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10009-0
00:46:44.972 --> 00:46:48.435
Yeah, there if I can do it using
a loop also I can start a loop

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10009-1
00:46:48.435 --> 00:46:49.842
from the zeroth character.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10021-0
00:46:49.852 --> 00:46:53.322
I can go to first, second and
all I can do all that.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10068-0
00:46:53.552 --> 00:46:57.653
Finally, when I'm done with this
string, I will know that this

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10068-1
00:46:57.653 --> 00:47:01.755
was 01234 array indexes start
from zero, so my total length is

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10068-2
00:47:01.755 --> 00:47:05.922
5, so I can calculate the length
of the string using loop also.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10083-0
00:47:06.892 --> 00:47:09.772
But if I want to do it using
recursion, how do I do that?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10100-0
00:47:11.582 --> 00:47:14.960
I know a base case that when
there are no strings, it is an

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10100-1
00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:15.692
empty string.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10104-0
00:47:15.702 --> 00:47:16.542
What is its size?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10113-0
00:47:18.422 --> 00:47:19.832
Yeah, I have an empty string.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10123-0
00:47:20.122 --> 00:47:21.952
I don't have any string at all.
No character.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10131-0
00:47:22.002 --> 00:47:22.802
Then what is its length?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10133-0
00:47:22.812 --> 00:47:23.232
Zero.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10144-0
00:47:23.442 --> 00:47:25.672
I know that it is a no brainer.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10164-0
00:47:25.682 --> 00:47:28.455
I don't need to do any
calculation or you know any

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10164-1
00:47:28.455 --> 00:47:30.412
further breaking it down and so
on.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10173-0
00:47:30.512 --> 00:47:31.712
So that becomes my base case.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10188-0
00:47:32.602 --> 00:47:35.893
I'm telling if this string is
empty, no characters, then

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10188-1
00:47:35.893 --> 00:47:36.932
return it as zero.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10214-0
00:47:37.752 --> 00:47:41.121
Otherwise, compute the length of
the string without the first

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10214-1
00:47:41.121 --> 00:47:44.381
character, and since we are
neglecting the first character,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10214-2
00:47:44.381 --> 00:47:45.522
we are doing A1 plus.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10249-0
00:47:45.832 --> 00:47:51.204
So what we're trying to do is
try to do the length of 1 plus

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10249-1
00:47:51.204 --> 00:47:56.752
length of I .K.S costs and then
again we are telling for cost.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10290-0
00:47:56.762 --> 00:48:01.776
Do we test one plus length of
case and then we are telling one

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10290-1
00:48:01.776 --> 00:48:06.233
place ignore the first card
again OnePlus length of a S

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10290-2
00:48:06.233 --> 00:48:10.292
again this is 1 + 1 + 1 plus
length of 1 plus yes.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10306-0
00:48:10.802 --> 00:48:15.912
Then it will become 1 + 1 + 1 +
1 plus length of yes.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10315-0
00:48:15.922 --> 00:48:18.962
For that it is 1 plus nothing
for nothing.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10328-0
00:48:18.972 --> 00:48:20.902
You know that that is the base
case that is 0.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10334-0
00:48:21.052 --> 00:48:22.132
So you Add all this.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10336-0
00:48:22.142 --> 00:48:22.592
That is fine.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10339-0
00:48:24.012 --> 00:48:24.202
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10370-0
00:48:24.212 --> 00:48:28.249
Is it making sense, guys, all of
you, every time when we went for

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10370-1
00:48:28.249 --> 00:48:32.042
recursion we solved the problem
of a slightly smaller length.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10409-0
00:48:32.112 --> 00:48:35.478
Initially, we wanted to know the
length of Vikas, but we trimmed

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10409-1
00:48:35.478 --> 00:48:38.843
it down to I .K.S then to .K.S,
then to S, then to S and finally

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10409-2
00:48:38.843 --> 00:48:42.002
empty, meaning you hit the base
case and you got the answer.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10418-0
00:48:44.002 --> 00:48:45.912
No, this is broadly Divya.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10425-0
00:48:45.922 --> 00:48:47.552
It falls into these two
categories.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10436-0
00:48:47.622 --> 00:48:49.752
Any algorithm that you know have
a look at it.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10448-0
00:48:50.062 --> 00:48:52.472
Mostly they will fall under
these two categories.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10451-0
00:48:52.482 --> 00:48:53.612
Broad categories only.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10469-0
00:48:53.962 --> 00:48:56.591
Either it will use some looping
paradigms or it will use

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10469-1
00:48:56.591 --> 00:48:57.052
recursion.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10488-0
00:48:57.582 --> 00:49:00.147
If you give look at books
software, it will of course use

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10488-1
00:49:00.147 --> 00:49:01.032
both of them, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10501-0
00:49:01.042 --> 00:49:03.487
Some parts will be looping, some
parts will be recursion and so

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10501-1
00:49:03.487 --> 00:49:03.602
on.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10512-0
00:49:04.892 --> 00:49:07.322
Yeah, it's the same example.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10558-0
00:49:07.332 --> 00:49:11.050
I've again given a small, you
know pseudo code type of a thing

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10558-1
00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:14.355
and just like Vikas, I have
traced it out using a small

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10558-2
00:49:14.355 --> 00:49:18.132
string that AC length of AC is
nothing but one plus length of C

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10558-3
00:49:18.132 --> 00:49:19.962
length of C is nothing but one.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10575-0
00:49:20.012 --> 00:49:23.599
Let's you know length of E
length of is nothing but one

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10575-1
00:49:23.599 --> 00:49:24.432
plus nothing.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10584-0
00:49:24.442 --> 00:49:26.622
So this is nothing is 0 right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10595-0
00:49:26.732 --> 00:49:29.012
So it goes back and length of AC
is 3.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10600-0
00:49:30.692 --> 00:49:30.952
Right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10625-0
00:49:32.272 --> 00:49:36.154
So all of you understood what is
recursion you are breaking down

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10625-1
00:49:36.154 --> 00:49:38.662
the problem into smaller sub
size, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10642-0
00:49:39.012 --> 00:49:41.810
And every time you are doing
that, you are reaching closer to

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10642-1
00:49:41.810 --> 00:49:42.442
the base case.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10655-0
00:49:43.012 --> 00:49:45.682
Once you hit the base case, you
know the answer already, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10667-0
00:49:45.792 --> 00:49:48.042
For base case something like
this like 0 and so on.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10677-0
00:49:48.352 --> 00:49:51.512
And then you again, you know, go
back to get the final answer.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10689-0
00:49:53.522 --> 00:49:55.802
Let's take this example of
factorial of a number.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10698-0
00:49:56.732 --> 00:49:57.902
What is factorial of a number?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10705-0
00:49:59.202 --> 00:50:00.182
What is factorial of five?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10730-0
00:50:02.462 --> 00:50:07.362
By factorial is nothing but 5
into 4 into 3 into 2 into one

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10730-1
00:50:07.362 --> 00:50:08.832
right normal math.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10753-0
00:50:09.162 --> 00:50:11.855
If you want to calculate
factorial of any number using a

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10753-1
00:50:11.855 --> 00:50:13.982
program right, how can I write
an algorithm?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10760-0
00:50:14.502 --> 00:50:15.772
I can write it using both.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10772-0
00:50:16.092 --> 00:50:20.292
I can either use iteration or I
can use recursion.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10785-0
00:50:20.722 --> 00:50:24.012
So this first part is using, So
what is it using?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10798-0
00:50:24.782 --> 00:50:26.892
It is using a loop so it is
iteration.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10803-0
00:50:27.702 --> 00:50:28.652
I'm having a variable.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10808-0
00:50:28.702 --> 00:50:30.232
I'm having a loop right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10819-0
00:50:30.242 --> 00:50:33.632
I'm doing result equal to result
in two, I here.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10836-0
00:50:33.642 --> 00:50:36.633
Note that I starts from 1,
otherwise the whole answer will

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10836-1
00:50:36.633 --> 00:50:37.952
always become zero, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10848-0
00:50:38.562 --> 00:50:40.492
It will always be 0, so be
careful.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10854-0
00:50:40.502 --> 00:50:41.292
It starts with one.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10882-0
00:50:41.722 --> 00:50:45.818
It goes all the way till equal
to north, right and you are

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10882-1
00:50:45.818 --> 00:50:48.942
doing I equal to is it equal to
into result?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10907-0
00:50:48.952 --> 00:50:52.175
And finally, they're variable
will have your result, meaning

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10907-1
00:50:52.175 --> 00:50:54.712
it will have one in two one,
then one into two.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10926-0
00:50:54.852 --> 00:50:58.494
Then you know that 2 into 3,
that's six into, you know, five

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10926-1
00:50:58.494 --> 00:50:58.912
and S1.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10936-0
00:51:00.002 --> 00:51:02.252
This is the way to do it using
iteration.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10941-0
00:51:02.382 --> 00:51:04.112
What about recursion?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10949-0
00:51:04.822 --> 00:51:07.012
We're telling when what are the
0 factorial?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10963-0
00:51:09.412 --> 00:51:13.822
Yeah, anyone 0 factorial that is
also one very good.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10972-0
00:51:13.892 --> 00:51:15.442
So this could have been even
better.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10997-0
00:51:15.452 --> 00:51:21.423
I could have returned this code
as when N equal equal to 0 or

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/10997-1
00:51:21.423 --> 00:51:24.312
when N equal equal to 1 right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11010-0
00:51:24.532 --> 00:51:26.552
In that case, I know that the
answer is 1 only.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11031-0
00:51:26.942 --> 00:51:32.505
That is my base case, otherwise
I will do 10 into factorial of n

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11031-1
00:51:32.505 --> 00:51:33.532
-, 1, right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11047-0
00:51:34.862 --> 00:51:38.438
But for five you will do
factorial of five into factorial

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11047-1
00:51:38.438 --> 00:51:38.932
of four.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11058-0
00:51:39.322 --> 00:51:42.082
For four you will do 4 into
factorial of three.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11072-0
00:51:42.522 --> 00:51:44.922
For three you will do three into
factorial of two.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11103-0
00:51:45.732 --> 00:51:49.720
For two, you'll do you know
factorial of two into one, and

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11103-1
00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:53.775
for one again when you want
vector of one you know you have

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11103-2
00:51:53.775 --> 00:51:55.262
reached the base case.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11118-0
00:51:55.272 --> 00:51:58.213
The whole answer will be one, so
you will again, you know,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11118-1
00:51:58.213 --> 00:51:58.712
backtrack.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11144-0
00:51:58.912 --> 00:52:01.715
You will substitute one as I
answer, and so on, and finally

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11144-1
00:52:01.715 --> 00:52:04.052
you'll get the same 120 it it is
the same answer.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11160-0
00:52:04.062 --> 00:52:06.376
It is the same way, but we have
returned it in the two different

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11160-1
00:52:06.376 --> 00:52:06.732
paradigms.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11162-0
00:52:07.872 --> 00:52:08.102
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11171-0
00:52:08.112 --> 00:52:09.332
Is this clear guys for all of
you?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11189-0
00:52:11.282 --> 00:52:13.634
Same problem solving either or
recursion or growth will be

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11189-1
00:52:13.634 --> 00:52:14.392
same, yes, correct.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11194-0
00:52:14.462 --> 00:52:15.572
It should be the same, yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11200-0
00:52:15.582 --> 00:52:17.672
Otherwise there is something
wrong, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11209-0
00:52:17.782 --> 00:52:19.202
So it should be the same order
of growth.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11212-0
00:52:22.002 --> 00:52:22.192
Cool.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11228-0
00:52:23.312 --> 00:52:25.752
So now let's look at how do you
analyze these two?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11246-0
00:52:26.412 --> 00:52:29.185
If this type of algorithm is
given, how do you analyze if

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11246-1
00:52:29.185 --> 00:52:31.242
this type of recursive algorithm
is given?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11251-0
00:52:31.252 --> 00:52:31.802
How do you analyze?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11267-0
00:52:32.732 --> 00:52:34.922
I will look at that and then I
leave you free for the day.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11271-0
00:52:35.592 --> 00:52:35.732
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11285-0
00:52:36.502 --> 00:52:38.858
The first part, which is an
iterative algorithm, do you

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11285-1
00:52:38.858 --> 00:52:40.162
already know how to analyze it?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11296-0
00:52:42.142 --> 00:52:44.722
Analysis of non recursive
algorithms.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11298-0
00:52:44.992 --> 00:52:46.122
Nonrecursive means what?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11313-0
00:52:48.832 --> 00:52:51.212
Nirmal, what do you mean by non
recursive?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11321-0
00:52:52.392 --> 00:52:53.292
I keep having this.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11326-0
00:52:53.302 --> 00:52:54.682
You know, word place.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11331-0
00:52:54.692 --> 00:52:55.452
Yeah. Iteration.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11340-0
00:52:55.462 --> 00:52:58.352
Yeah, nonrecursive means it is
iteration, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11346-0
00:52:58.362 --> 00:52:59.322
There are only two techniques.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11355-0
00:52:59.332 --> 00:53:00.882
One is iteration, one is
recursive.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11362-0
00:53:01.032 --> 00:53:02.912
So nonrecursive means iteration.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11367-0
00:53:04.212 --> 00:53:04.962
So what do you do?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11378-0
00:53:05.032 --> 00:53:06.942
This is the story that you have
already learned.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11395-0
00:53:07.192 --> 00:53:09.751
Yeah, based on the input size,
determine the number of

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11395-1
00:53:09.751 --> 00:53:10.822
parameters to consider.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11399-0
00:53:10.832 --> 00:53:11.562
That is your yen.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11415-0
00:53:12.152 --> 00:53:15.332
Identify the basic or primitive
operation in that algorithm.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11439-0
00:53:16.322 --> 00:53:19.062
Check whether the number of
times the basic operation is

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11439-1
00:53:19.062 --> 00:53:21.851
executed depends only on the
size of input or are they in

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11439-2
00:53:21.851 --> 00:53:22.572
loop? Etcetera.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11446-0
00:53:22.922 --> 00:53:23.642
Try to find that out.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11461-0
00:53:24.602 --> 00:53:28.052
Obtain the total number of times
the basic operation executed.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11476-0
00:53:28.802 --> 00:53:33.782
Simplify using standard formulas
and get the order of growth

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11476-1
00:53:33.782 --> 00:53:34.272
right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11542-0
00:53:34.282 --> 00:53:37.671
This order of growth is nothing
but T of N the time taken for

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11542-1
00:53:37.671 --> 00:53:41.224
North you will get some equation
here and you would have applied

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11542-2
00:53:41.224 --> 00:53:44.504
those you know the standard
formula, meaning you will apply

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11542-3
00:53:44.504 --> 00:53:47.729
normal math formula like for
example if 3N plus N is there

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11542-4
00:53:47.729 --> 00:53:51.118
you can make it as 4 N and then
in this foreign what will you

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11542-5
00:53:51.118 --> 00:53:51.282
do?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11557-0
00:53:51.332 --> 00:53:55.182
Anyone when I'm trying to do
algorithm analysis, does it?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11566-0
00:53:55.232 --> 00:53:56.122
There's this four matter.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11570-0
00:53:57.172 --> 00:53:57.822
You cancel it.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11574-0
00:53:57.832 --> 00:53:58.082
Four.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11582-0
00:53:58.092 --> 00:53:58.662
I'll make it as.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11629-0
00:53:58.672 --> 00:54:02.576
Yet, right so this process I
will do and I will get that is

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11629-1
00:54:02.576 --> 00:54:06.676
my order of growth and then I
will put it inside my asymptotic

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11629-2
00:54:06.676 --> 00:54:10.516
notation that you have already
learned right for iterative

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11629-3
00:54:10.516 --> 00:54:11.232
algorithms.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11651-0
00:54:13.072 --> 00:54:16.601
Can you read real quick look at
this code and firstly tell me is

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11651-1
00:54:16.601 --> 00:54:19.262
this recursive algorithm or
iterative algorithm?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11659-0
00:54:20.842 --> 00:54:22.302
Yeah, that this is the rule,
yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11667-0
00:54:26.282 --> 00:54:26.852
What is the rule?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11671-0
00:54:27.782 --> 00:54:28.972
Count the basic operation.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11694-0
00:54:29.022 --> 00:54:32.368
Look at loops or whatever it is
and try to get the you know

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11694-1
00:54:32.368 --> 00:54:34.432
total number using standard
formula.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11696-0
00:54:34.442 --> 00:54:35.232
Simplify it.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11702-0
00:54:35.602 --> 00:54:36.882
Get the order of growth.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11714-0
00:54:36.942 --> 00:54:39.942
Put it in big O notation for
this one.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11719-0
00:54:40.352 --> 00:54:41.462
Can you first tell me?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11726-0
00:54:41.672 --> 00:54:42.742
OK, it is iterative, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11751-0
00:54:42.752 --> 00:54:45.408
Because there is a loop here and
there is no function that is

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11751-1
00:54:45.408 --> 00:54:47.122
calling itself the same name,
etcetera.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11754-0
00:54:47.132 --> 00:54:48.542
Is not there, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11757-0
00:54:48.892 --> 00:54:49.412
Perfect.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11773-0
00:54:49.592 --> 00:54:53.022
So for this iterative algorithm,
all this is just input output.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11782-0
00:54:53.272 --> 00:54:55.592
You know, comments, the actual
code just starts here.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11791-0
00:54:56.732 --> 00:54:58.862
Can you do exactly what we
learned last class?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11794-0
00:55:02.732 --> 00:55:02.872
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11802-0
00:55:04.292 --> 00:55:05.252
Yes, we go to others.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11820-0
00:55:06.882 --> 00:55:09.668
There is a four loop you look
at, you know each line, you will

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11820-1
00:55:09.668 --> 00:55:10.022
look at.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11829-0
00:55:10.032 --> 00:55:11.672
OK, there is this basic
operation.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11856-0
00:55:11.682 --> 00:55:15.299
There is this basic operation
and it is inside a loop and this

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11856-1
00:55:15.299 --> 00:55:17.252
loop there is no break and
other.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11865-0
00:55:17.262 --> 00:55:20.282
So this loop is going to run for
end times, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11869-0
00:55:23.042 --> 00:55:23.842
Yeah, real quick.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11893-0
00:55:28.492 --> 00:55:31.623
Yes, NANDAN, time complexity
will be the same, but space wise

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11893-1
00:55:31.623 --> 00:55:33.542
there are some, you know
differences.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11902-0
00:55:33.552 --> 00:55:35.562
We will look at it in the next
classes.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11906-0
00:55:35.572 --> 00:55:35.792
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11908-0
00:55:35.802 --> 00:55:36.472
When the time comes.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11914-0
00:55:39.172 --> 00:55:39.882
Yeah, very good.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11924-0
00:55:39.932 --> 00:55:42.102
The complexity of this code is
we go off.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11927-0
00:55:42.172 --> 00:55:42.522
Yen.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11936-0
00:55:42.692 --> 00:55:45.612
Correct, because there is this
constant primitive operation.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11951-0
00:55:45.622 --> 00:55:48.800
There is this constant primitive
operation and then that is

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11951-1
00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:49.912
inside a loop, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11966-0
00:55:49.962 --> 00:55:52.272
A single loop, so it is there is
no break, nothing.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11994-0
00:55:52.282 --> 00:55:55.393
So it is we go off yet in this
problem, the size of the input

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/11994-1
00:55:55.393 --> 00:55:57.952
is yen and this is the parameter
to be considered.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12025-0
00:55:58.502 --> 00:56:01.849
The statement executed is in
loop and the basic operation is

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12025-1
00:56:01.849 --> 00:56:05.470
key is equal to F5, meaning that
comparison which is the constant

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12025-2
00:56:05.470 --> 00:56:06.732
which is inside a loop.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12044-0
00:56:07.242 --> 00:56:09.696
So the basic operation is inside
a single loop and hence the

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12044-1
00:56:09.696 --> 00:56:10.822
complexity is big off, yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12061-0
00:56:13.632 --> 00:56:15.793
Actually you should have done
this like what we did in the

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12061-1
00:56:15.793 --> 00:56:16.452
last class, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12086-0
00:56:16.462 --> 00:56:19.062
So every line you will look at,
you know this is going to take

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12086-1
00:56:19.062 --> 00:56:21.002
from zero to a, you know, and
minus one there.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12090-0
00:56:21.012 --> 00:56:21.722
There is this line.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12099-0
00:56:21.912 --> 00:56:24.662
This return should have been in
the next line, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12109-0
00:56:24.772 --> 00:56:25.882
So you can write it like that.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12122-0
00:56:25.892 --> 00:56:28.645
Simplify it and try to, you
know, cancel and get this

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12122-1
00:56:28.645 --> 00:56:29.002
answer.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12158-0
00:56:29.822 --> 00:56:33.835
So if you are given an iterative
algorithm to write, will you be

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12158-1
00:56:33.835 --> 00:56:37.168
able to write the seudo code,
calculate the primitive

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12158-2
00:56:37.168 --> 00:56:40.502
operations, simplify it and put
it in big O notation?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12162-0
00:56:40.602 --> 00:56:41.422
Will you be able to do this?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12165-0
00:56:44.092 --> 00:56:44.362
Yes.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12176-0
00:56:44.372 --> 00:56:46.762
No, I want all of your responses
real quick.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12179-0
00:56:46.832 --> 00:56:48.482
Yeah, right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12186-0
00:56:48.492 --> 00:56:52.112
The operation observe the
primitive submit.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12199-0
00:56:52.122 --> 00:56:54.752
It simplify it, put it in big O
notation.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12219-0
00:56:55.192 --> 00:56:59.586
One part of the story is over,
but now if a recursive algorithm

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12219-1
00:56:59.586 --> 00:57:01.302
is given, what do you do?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12259-0
00:57:02.342 --> 00:57:06.377
There is a difference if there
is a recursive algorithm given

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12259-1
00:57:06.377 --> 00:57:10.021
the same function is being
called again and again, then

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12259-2
00:57:10.021 --> 00:57:13.991
there is a question on how many
times it executes and things

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12259-3
00:57:13.991 --> 00:57:14.642
like that.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12266-0
00:57:14.732 --> 00:57:16.882
Yeah, yes, yes.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12277-0
00:57:16.892 --> 00:57:18.942
You have to all of you have to
work on these guys.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12280-0
00:57:18.952 --> 00:57:19.172
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12311-0
00:57:19.182 --> 00:57:22.344
So every year I get this
feedback that we are talking

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12311-1
00:57:22.344 --> 00:57:25.799
with all seems good, but then
I'm confused and things like

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12311-2
00:57:25.799 --> 00:57:26.092
that.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12318-0
00:57:26.182 --> 00:57:28.242
That is where all my decks have
problems.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12324-0
00:57:28.442 --> 00:57:29.242
Try to solve them.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12338-0
00:57:29.292 --> 00:57:33.072
Yeah, only when you solve it,
rewatch may recordings again.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12360-0
00:57:33.262 --> 00:57:36.027
It will make more sense and
always feel free to drop an

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12360-1
00:57:36.027 --> 00:57:38.052
email or put discussion forum
questions.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12365-0
00:57:38.322 --> 00:57:38.592
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12371-0
00:57:38.602 --> 00:57:40.152
Only then the real learning will
happen.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12373-0
00:57:40.722 --> 00:57:40.892
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12375-0
00:57:42.452 --> 00:57:42.762
Cool.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12400-0
00:57:42.772 --> 00:57:45.336
So we just learned that for
iterative algorithms it is this,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12400-1
00:57:45.336 --> 00:57:47.312
you know, simple steps you will
be able to do.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12407-0
00:57:48.142 --> 00:57:50.262
But when are there are recursive
algorithms?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12415-0
00:57:50.322 --> 00:57:51.552
It is not very straightforward.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12431-0
00:57:52.382 --> 00:57:54.781
The first few steps are the
same, meaning what you will do

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12431-1
00:57:54.781 --> 00:57:56.042
is you will consider the input.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12438-0
00:57:56.052 --> 00:57:57.602
You will identify the basic
operation.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12462-0
00:57:57.612 --> 00:58:01.231
You will see, you know if the
basic operation is executed on,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12462-1
00:58:01.231 --> 00:58:04.092
you know different inputs or you
know how is it.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12476-0
00:58:04.462 --> 00:58:08.923
But after that step, there is a
new thing that is in iterative

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12476-1
00:58:08.923 --> 00:58:09.702
algorithms.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12491-0
00:58:09.712 --> 00:58:13.152
What you did after this step you
submitted it, you simplified it.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12518-0
00:58:13.202 --> 00:58:16.715
You applied those you know 2
rules constant and lower order

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12518-1
00:58:16.715 --> 00:58:19.292
term and then you put it in big
O notation.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12531-0
00:58:19.342 --> 00:58:23.182
But here you will create a
notation or a relation.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12570-0
00:58:24.032 --> 00:58:27.670
That relation is called as a
recurrence relation with an

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12570-1
00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:31.437
initial condition, and then you
will solve this recurrence

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12570-2
00:58:31.437 --> 00:58:35.586
relation and once you solve the
recurrence relation you will get

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12570-3
00:58:35.586 --> 00:58:37.182
the same order of growth.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12589-0
00:58:37.192 --> 00:58:40.618
Whatever you were always getting
right that equation 2 N plus 56N

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12589-1
00:58:40.618 --> 00:58:41.552
plus 10, whatever.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12608-0
00:58:41.712 --> 00:58:45.401
You know North Square plus you
know N + 2 such type of an order

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12608-1
00:58:45.401 --> 00:58:45.862
of Ruth.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12618-0
00:58:45.872 --> 00:58:49.062
You will get in that you will
apply those two rules.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12627-0
00:58:49.072 --> 00:58:52.022
Apply that lower order and
constant.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12631-0
00:58:52.102 --> 00:58:52.592
Put it in.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12634-0
00:58:52.602 --> 00:58:53.112
Here we go.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12656-0
00:58:53.122 --> 00:58:57.191
Rotation only addition is you
are going to create something

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12656-1
00:58:57.191 --> 00:58:59.362
called as a recurrence relation.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12671-0
00:58:59.712 --> 00:59:02.764
You are going to solve that in
order to get your order of

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12671-1
00:59:02.764 --> 00:59:03.132
growth.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12674-0
00:59:06.562 --> 00:59:06.722
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12682-0
00:59:07.892 --> 00:59:09.302
Yeah, that we will not be doing,
Krishna.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12686-0
00:59:09.312 --> 00:59:09.472
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12698-0
00:59:09.482 --> 00:59:11.902
So that is what I mentioned in
the first class, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12712-0
00:59:12.312 --> 00:59:15.395
We are always going to analyze
algorithms in their worst

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12712-1
00:59:15.395 --> 00:59:15.882
behavior.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12726-0
00:59:15.892 --> 00:59:19.441
In the worst case, so always we
will be using just big O

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12726-1
00:59:19.441 --> 00:59:20.002
notation.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12742-0
00:59:20.072 --> 00:59:23.860
We will not be using Omega or,
you know other notations Theta

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12742-1
00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:24.532
and others.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12745-0
00:59:24.602 --> 00:59:24.742
This.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12748-0
00:59:25.832 --> 00:59:26.062
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12754-0
00:59:26.072 --> 00:59:26.422
Is that clear?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12761-0
00:59:27.392 --> 00:59:28.592
Initial condition is base case.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12763-0
00:59:28.602 --> 00:59:29.132
That is right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12765-0
00:59:29.142 --> 00:59:29.502
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12776-0
00:59:29.552 --> 00:59:31.932
So you should not go about
analyzing all other cases.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12783-0
00:59:31.942 --> 00:59:32.202
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12811-0
00:59:32.212 --> 00:59:35.818
In all our exams, also, if you
find a question like you know,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12811-1
00:59:35.818 --> 00:59:39.540
analyze the time complexity, it
simply means we go, yeah, worst

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12811-2
00:59:39.540 --> 00:59:40.122
case only.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12836-0
00:59:40.132 --> 00:59:42.614
Yeah, even if it is not
explicitly told, it is

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12836-1
00:59:42.614 --> 00:59:45.942
understood that we are always
going to do worst case analysis.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12842-0
00:59:46.952 --> 00:59:48.142
Yeah, Omega analysis.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12846-0
00:59:48.152 --> 00:59:49.182
Also you can do. Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12873-0
00:59:49.192 --> 00:59:52.409
Research people do all that for
some cases, but in this course

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12873-1
00:59:52.409 --> 00:59:55.422
and then in general practice, we
will always do worst case

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12873-2
00:59:55.422 --> 00:59:55.882
analysis.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12875-0
00:59:57.582 --> 00:59:57.832
Cool.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12879-0
00:59:57.842 --> 00:59:57.952
No.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12883-0
00:59:57.962 --> 00:59:59.312
What does this recurrence
relation?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12902-0
00:59:59.402 --> 01:00:03.480
Yeah, so recurrence relation is
when an algorithm contains a

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12902-1
01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:05.152
recursive call to itself.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12906-0
01:00:05.242 --> 01:00:06.172
It's a running time.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12914-0
01:00:06.182 --> 01:00:07.942
Can often be described by a
recurrence.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12939-0
01:00:08.962 --> 01:00:13.772
So a recurrence is an equation
or inequality that describes a

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12939-1
01:00:13.772 --> 01:00:17.652
function in terms of the value
on smaller inputs.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12954-0
01:00:19.542 --> 01:00:22.472
Yeah, we will see some examples,
but it'll be even more clear.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12967-0
01:00:22.662 --> 01:00:26.732
Yeah, this is a typical example
of a recurrence relation.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12970-0
01:00:27.902 --> 01:00:28.292
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12976-0
01:00:28.342 --> 01:00:29.812
Let me first read this out.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12996-0
01:00:29.822 --> 01:00:32.487
Yeah, so don't get panicked the
moment you see equations like

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/12996-1
01:00:32.487 --> 01:00:33.992
this, there is a way to read
this.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13004-0
01:00:34.382 --> 01:00:35.912
Let me just slowly do it for
you.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13015-0
01:00:36.142 --> 01:00:39.052
Observe it and then we will take
it from there, yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13030-0
01:00:42.472 --> 01:00:45.582
This is a recurrence relation of
some recursive algorithm.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13052-0
01:00:46.092 --> 01:00:55.104
Correct the time taken for the
algorithm with N input is 1 when

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13052-1
01:00:55.104 --> 01:00:56.372
your end.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13055-0
01:00:56.382 --> 01:00:56.782
This is 0.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13062-0
01:00:58.282 --> 01:00:58.912
How did I read it?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13082-0
01:01:00.112 --> 01:01:04.807
The algorithms order of growth
or the time taken for yen input

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13082-1
01:01:04.807 --> 01:01:06.372
is one or a constant.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13092-0
01:01:07.262 --> 01:01:11.622
When my input is zero, that is
one line.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13106-0
01:01:11.892 --> 01:01:15.212
Second, the time taken for the
same algorithm for end input.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13139-0
01:01:16.152 --> 01:01:19.995
This one plus the time taken for
that same algorithm with n -, 1

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13139-1
01:01:19.995 --> 01:01:23.661
as the you know, time taken for
North minus when N is greater

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13139-2
01:01:23.661 --> 01:01:24.252
than zero.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13145-0
01:01:25.782 --> 01:01:28.552
Is it making sense there?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13151-0
01:01:28.562 --> 01:01:29.752
Is this recursive algorithm?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13170-0
01:01:30.202 --> 01:01:33.821
When I pause the zero as input
to that, it will take just one

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13170-1
01:01:33.821 --> 01:01:34.522
as the time.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13209-0
01:01:35.232 --> 01:01:39.148
But when I pass a number greater
than N, it goes into this

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13209-1
01:01:39.148 --> 01:01:43.263
recursive case and that time
it's complexity will be one plus

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13209-2
01:01:43.263 --> 01:01:45.652
the time taken for to FN minus
one.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13214-0
01:01:46.612 --> 01:01:47.962
Something like that, correct?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13222-0
01:01:48.452 --> 01:01:49.462
Can you repeat how to read it?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13228-0
01:01:49.472 --> 01:01:50.062
Yeah, I'll do that.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13271-0
01:01:50.072 --> 01:01:56.433
Yeah, the time taken for North
input is 1 when my input size is

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13271-1
01:01:56.433 --> 01:02:02.894
0 and the time taken for yen is
1 plus the time taken for n -, 1

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13271-2
01:02:02.894 --> 01:02:06.472
when my input is greater than
zero.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13275-0
01:02:07.962 --> 01:02:08.502
Is that clear?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13293-0
01:02:08.512 --> 01:02:12.496
Romik, all of you others, but
this is how you write a

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13293-1
01:02:12.496 --> 01:02:13.972
recurrence relation.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13312-0
01:02:14.462 --> 01:02:16.888
Why are we considering base case
as it won't be the case, we will

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13312-1
01:02:16.888 --> 01:02:17.292
come there.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13317-0
01:02:17.302 --> 01:02:18.852
Yeah, you cannot.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13339-0
01:02:18.902 --> 01:02:22.213
So can you put this whole thing
inside Virgo notation and tell

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13339-1
01:02:22.213 --> 01:02:24.052
this is the complexity for
Andrea?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13347-0
01:02:25.352 --> 01:02:26.162
You cannot do that, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13354-0
01:02:26.172 --> 01:02:27.682
Because this is some equation.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13361-0
01:02:27.692 --> 01:02:29.542
Yeah, this is a mathematical
equation.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13379-0
01:02:30.052 --> 01:02:33.462
This is not order of growth
order of growth as we learned.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13385-0
01:02:33.522 --> 01:02:35.402
Should we always there in that
table?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13400-0
01:02:35.652 --> 01:02:37.842
It should either be one or it
should be log in.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13433-0
01:02:37.852 --> 01:02:41.675
It should be N it should be N
log N it should be N square NQN

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13433-1
01:02:41.675 --> 01:02:44.882
power 4 something or it should
be 2 power N factor.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13440-0
01:02:44.972 --> 01:02:45.902
It cannot be random.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13446-0
01:02:45.912 --> 01:02:48.802
Things like this right Y n -, 1.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13459-0
01:02:48.892 --> 01:02:51.622
So because for this algorithm it
is like that, yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13465-0
01:02:51.632 --> 01:02:53.242
For each question, it might
vary.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13467-0
01:02:53.312 --> 01:02:53.832
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13481-0
01:02:53.972 --> 01:02:56.542
So for some recursive algorithm,
this has been derived.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13490-0
01:02:57.332 --> 01:02:58.652
In this case it is north minus
one.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13502-0
01:02:58.662 --> 01:03:00.602
In some other case, it may be in
May 2 or whatever.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13520-0
01:03:00.612 --> 01:03:05.778
Also, yeah, in this case we are
breaking it down by one each

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13520-1
01:03:05.778 --> 01:03:06.202
time.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13529-0
01:03:06.212 --> 01:03:07.282
That is where it is in minus
one.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13533-0
01:03:08.622 --> 01:03:09.112
Yeah, correct.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13540-0
01:03:09.242 --> 01:03:10.472
We are breaking it down correct?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13551-0
01:03:10.542 --> 01:03:13.342
So once you get this, we left to
solve this.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13569-0
01:03:14.662 --> 01:03:19.196
Yeah, we have to solve this and
after solving we will get an

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13569-1
01:03:19.196 --> 01:03:20.162
answer right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13580-0
01:03:20.312 --> 01:03:22.702
And that answer will be the
order of growth.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13590-0
01:03:23.112 --> 01:03:24.962
You will put it inside your big
O notation.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13599-0
01:03:25.072 --> 01:03:27.262
So for solving I need both of
them.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13609-0
01:03:27.772 --> 01:03:29.142
I need the base case also.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13627-0
01:03:29.212 --> 01:03:33.009
I need the recursive case also,
that is why that base case is

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13627-1
01:03:33.009 --> 01:03:34.602
also mentioned here. Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13643-0
01:03:36.302 --> 01:03:39.493
Well, now the question is, how
do you solve this recurrence

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13643-1
01:03:39.493 --> 01:03:39.972
relation?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13652-0
01:03:41.222 --> 01:03:42.912
Right, there are three ways to
do it.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13681-0
01:03:43.732 --> 01:03:47.888
I can either use a recursion
tree method or I can do an

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13681-1
01:03:47.888 --> 01:03:52.118
iterative substitution method,
or I can use the master's

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13681-2
01:03:52.118 --> 01:03:52.712
theorem.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13692-0
01:03:53.262 --> 01:03:56.042
Each of them have their own, you
know, positives and negatives.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13726-0
01:03:56.502 --> 01:03:59.443
We'll take a very quick break
and we'll come back in 5 minutes

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13726-1
01:03:59.443 --> 01:04:02.431
and then we'll learn all these
three techniques and then we are

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13726-2
01:04:02.431 --> 01:04:03.132
done for today.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13743-0
01:04:04.182 --> 01:04:06.671
I'll still be around, so if you
have any other questions or

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13743-1
01:04:06.671 --> 01:04:08.082
something we can chat about
that.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13752-0
01:04:09.942 --> 01:04:10.672
So far so good.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13760-0
01:04:10.682 --> 01:04:12.672
All of you were recursive
algorithms.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13767-0
01:04:12.682 --> 01:04:14.152
You will write the recursive
algorithm.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13783-0
01:04:14.562 --> 01:04:17.109
You cannot just count the
primitive operations, submit it

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13783-1
01:04:17.109 --> 01:04:17.812
and simplify it.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13800-0
01:04:18.042 --> 01:04:21.846
So you will create a recurrence
relation like this box after you

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13800-1
01:04:21.846 --> 01:04:22.432
create it.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13835-0
01:04:22.442 --> 01:04:25.520
You don't know what to do, so
you'll have to apply some of

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13835-1
01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:28.806
these techniques, one of them
and solve it after you solve it,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13835-2
01:04:28.806 --> 01:04:30.632
you will get that order of
growth.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13842-0
01:04:30.762 --> 01:04:31.612
Put it inside your.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13849-0
01:04:31.622 --> 01:04:33.872
Bingo or recursive algorithms.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13861-0
01:04:36.632 --> 01:04:38.042
Will base case always need to be
one?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13869-0
01:04:38.052 --> 01:04:39.322
No, it can be something
different.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13877-0
01:04:39.332 --> 01:04:41.682
Also, this can also be
different.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13895-0
01:04:41.692 --> 01:04:45.179
This can also be different and
here also all the integrity scan

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13895-1
01:04:45.179 --> 01:04:45.452
come.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13905-0
01:04:45.622 --> 01:04:48.030
It can change like equal to
north, greater than five,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13905-1
01:04:48.030 --> 01:04:48.432
whatever.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13915-0
01:04:48.902 --> 01:04:52.177
All these are, you know,
modifiable based on your

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13915-1
01:04:52.177 --> 01:04:52.832
algorithm.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13935-0
01:04:56.852 --> 01:04:59.518
And now you might have this
question why is he even talking

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13935-1
01:04:59.518 --> 01:05:00.762
about all this today, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13943-0
01:05:00.772 --> 01:05:02.182
We have not even started
algorithms.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13951-0
01:05:02.192 --> 01:05:04.002
We have not even looked at data
structure.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13964-0
01:05:04.272 --> 01:05:06.792
Why is it directly talking about
all this math stuff, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13986-0
01:05:07.512 --> 01:05:10.875
Because at the end of this
class, if you see a recurrence

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13986-1
01:05:10.875 --> 01:05:13.252
relation, you will know how to
solve it.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/13992-0
01:05:14.092 --> 01:05:14.472
Do you agree?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14003-0
01:05:15.422 --> 01:05:16.842
Because that is what we are
going to learn now.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14018-0
01:05:18.052 --> 01:05:20.545
You will be able to recognize
what is iteration, what is

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14018-1
01:05:20.545 --> 01:05:20.982
recursion.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14027-0
01:05:21.222 --> 01:05:22.172
All this you will learn today.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14055-0
01:05:22.912 --> 01:05:26.466
So in further classes and later
part of this semester, whenever

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14055-1
01:05:26.466 --> 01:05:29.908
we learn about an algorithm, I
will just create this relation

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14055-2
01:05:29.908 --> 01:05:31.352
and I will leave it there.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14073-0
01:05:31.722 --> 01:05:34.580
Yeah, you will know how to solve
this and how to get this final

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14073-1
01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:35.072
complexity.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14091-0
01:05:35.322 --> 01:05:37.802
In fact, you would have mastered
by then that in the class itself

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14091-1
01:05:37.802 --> 01:05:38.742
you will tell the answer.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14094-0
01:05:40.162 --> 01:05:40.352
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14126-0
01:05:40.362 --> 01:05:43.994
Is it making sense guys for all
of you to the first two classes

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14126-1
01:05:43.994 --> 01:05:47.513
just is more like, you know,
setting the context for the rest

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14126-2
01:05:47.513 --> 01:05:48.762
of the semester, yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14134-0
01:05:52.332 --> 01:05:53.162
Some questions are there.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14145-0
01:05:53.172 --> 01:05:55.516
I completely new to DS stuff
notation, algorithm, data

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14145-1
01:05:55.516 --> 01:05:55.942
structure.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14162-0
01:05:55.952 --> 01:05:59.379
Uh, any suggestions that yeah,
so I will, you know, give you 3

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14162-1
01:05:59.379 --> 01:06:00.522
steps of suggestions.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14169-0
01:06:00.592 --> 01:06:02.152
First step is attend classes.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14193-0
01:06:02.812 --> 01:06:06.058
Go back and watch these
recordings again and again and

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14193-1
01:06:06.058 --> 01:06:09.422
solve the problems in the slide
that is your first step.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14201-0
01:06:09.492 --> 01:06:11.062
All this is the first step.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14219-0
01:06:11.392 --> 01:06:14.812
The second step is go back to
your textbook and read the

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14219-1
01:06:14.812 --> 01:06:15.772
relevant topics.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14228-0
01:06:15.782 --> 01:06:17.742
From there, all of these are
there in the book.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14242-0
01:06:18.032 --> 01:06:22.248
Read them right and the third
step is go the extra mile.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14242-1
01:06:22.248 --> 01:06:22.692
Right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14250-0
01:06:22.782 --> 01:06:24.172
Try to go to the reference book.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14270-0
01:06:24.182 --> 01:06:26.964
Try to solve some you know
additional problems on the

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14270-1
01:06:26.964 --> 01:06:29.282
Internet on you know these
topics and so on.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14280-0
01:06:31.522 --> 01:06:33.092
The next question was by combo.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14294-0
01:06:33.102 --> 01:06:35.462
By definition, what is the
difference between order of

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14294-1
01:06:35.462 --> 01:06:36.792
growth and asymptotic notation?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14310-0
01:06:37.062 --> 01:06:39.511
Why are we saying calculate
order of growth and put it in

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14310-1
01:06:39.511 --> 01:06:39.722
Pico?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14323-0
01:06:39.972 --> 01:06:42.972
Is order of growth not the same
as what we specify in big O

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14323-1
01:06:42.972 --> 01:06:43.422
notation?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14330-0
01:06:43.432 --> 01:06:44.662
Yeah, very beautiful question.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14334-0
01:06:44.672 --> 01:06:46.072
It's a very subtle difference,
yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14355-0
01:06:47.882 --> 01:06:52.971
This is annotation and bingo
means that it is worst case and

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14355-1
01:06:52.971 --> 01:06:53.972
Omega Theta.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14385-0
01:06:54.122 --> 01:06:58.318
These are notations which denote
you know worst case you know

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14385-1
01:06:58.318 --> 01:07:02.312
best case, average case and so
on and what you have there.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14403-0
01:07:02.322 --> 01:07:05.704
In the other hand, and N square,
NQ, whatever you get, this is

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14403-1
01:07:05.704 --> 01:07:06.832
your order of growth.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14413-0
01:07:07.362 --> 01:07:09.072
So you need to club these two.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14448-0
01:07:09.342 --> 01:07:13.121
That is, when you can make
complete sense, you can tell

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14448-1
01:07:13.121 --> 01:07:17.102
that in my worst case, this is
my complexity in my average

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14448-2
01:07:17.102 --> 01:07:19.532
case, this is my complexity,
right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14466-0
01:07:19.602 --> 01:07:22.763
So that is why we are putting
this order of growth inside the

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14466-1
01:07:22.763 --> 01:07:23.222
notation.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14470-0
01:07:25.522 --> 01:07:25.762
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14477-0
01:07:25.772 --> 01:07:27.222
Is it making sense? Kamboj.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14506-0
01:07:27.232 --> 01:07:30.646
Yeah, if you just write the
order of growth, then I don't

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14506-1
01:07:30.646 --> 01:07:34.060
get the point in which case are
you telling this order of

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14506-2
01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:34.472
growth?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14548-0
01:07:34.882 --> 01:07:38.221
Is it in worst case or is it in
best case in which case is this

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14548-1
01:07:38.221 --> 01:07:41.038
the answer and we have always
learned only worst case

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14548-2
01:07:41.038 --> 01:07:44.429
analysis, meaning that dropping
the constant and all such things

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14548-3
01:07:44.429 --> 01:07:44.742
right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14554-0
01:07:44.892 --> 01:07:46.462
So that is worst case analysis.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14577-0
01:07:46.712 --> 01:07:50.559
So you'll have to tell that in
worst case that is in big O in

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14577-1
01:07:50.559 --> 01:07:51.242
worst case.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14633-0
01:07:51.252 --> 01:07:55.787
This is my complexity so that is
why we are putting that inside

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14633-1
01:07:55.787 --> 01:08:00.252
the notation in 400 and we are
dropping constant 400 but N log

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14633-2
01:08:00.252 --> 01:08:04.362
N ohm you know log in will be
less when compared to N why

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14633-3
01:08:04.362 --> 01:08:07.622
can't we drop the login so that
is why right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14672-0
01:08:07.632 --> 01:08:12.122
I mean, if you see here ¥400,
this 400 is a constant term

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14672-1
01:08:12.122 --> 01:08:16.303
whereas in yen log N there is a
N here also he's also

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14672-2
01:08:16.303 --> 01:08:19.632
contributing to this multiply
value right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14686-0
01:08:19.762 --> 01:08:22.522
So if this was some other
constant number then it is fine.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14703-0
01:08:22.532 --> 01:08:25.652
You can ignore but here this the
there is a end here also.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14732-0
01:08:26.162 --> 01:08:30.412
So you should not, but if it was
N plus log in, you can because

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14732-1
01:08:30.412 --> 01:08:33.732
this end is dominating and this
is a plus, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14737-0
01:08:33.742 --> 01:08:34.692
This is a separate answer.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14747-0
01:08:34.702 --> 01:08:37.152
This is a separate answer your
adding them there.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14764-0
01:08:37.162 --> 01:08:39.914
It doesn't make sense, but here
this login is multiplied with

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14764-1
01:08:39.914 --> 01:08:40.402
this. Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14768-0
01:08:40.842 --> 01:08:41.482
So you should not.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14805-0
01:08:43.452 --> 01:08:46.221
So can you explain order of
growth in break loop even when

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14805-1
01:08:46.221 --> 01:08:48.991
we have break statement inner
loop but still it is getting

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14805-2
01:08:48.991 --> 01:08:50.822
executed yen times as outlook
correct.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14822-0
01:08:50.912 --> 01:08:53.676
So when you have a break
statement, only the innermost

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14822-1
01:08:53.676 --> 01:08:54.682
loop will be exited.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14839-0
01:08:54.942 --> 01:08:58.033
The outer loop will still run,
so the outer loop complexity was

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14839-1
01:08:58.033 --> 01:08:59.482
then that is the final answer.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14849-0
01:09:03.192 --> 01:09:04.242
Vendran hats arrived out.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14889-0
01:09:04.252 --> 01:09:08.231
There are few cases where we
need more than one variable

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14889-1
01:09:08.231 --> 01:09:12.629
acting like you're even in even
the even numbers in a range of

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14889-2
01:09:12.629 --> 01:09:15.422
yen and do some action on even
numbers.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14900-0
01:09:15.512 --> 01:09:17.802
No, they're also yen is the
total right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14906-0
01:09:18.092 --> 01:09:19.332
So we need to consider that
only.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14911-0
01:09:21.962 --> 01:09:22.742
Yeah, N + m.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14916-0
01:09:22.752 --> 01:09:23.632
Yeah, that is correct.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14927-0
01:09:23.642 --> 01:09:25.172
Yeah, that is what we have to
do.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14950-0
01:09:25.882 --> 01:09:29.005
That is why there was a line
here that consider all the

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14950-1
01:09:29.005 --> 01:09:31.850
inputs right determine the
number of parameters to

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14950-2
01:09:31.850 --> 01:09:32.352
consider.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14972-0
01:09:32.402 --> 01:09:34.798
OK, if there are multiple
arguments, multiple inputs

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14972-1
01:09:34.798 --> 01:09:37.602
coming to your program, then you
should consider all of them.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14984-0
01:09:40.102 --> 01:09:43.212
Yeah, in quiz there was a
question.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14988-0
01:09:43.222 --> 01:09:43.972
Uh empower four.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14992-0
01:09:43.982 --> 01:09:44.122
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/14999-0
01:09:44.132 --> 01:09:45.212
We will come back to the
question.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15002-0
01:09:45.222 --> 01:09:45.392
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15030-0
01:09:45.402 --> 01:09:48.376
We will come back to the
question I had that is, we also

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15030-1
01:09:48.376 --> 01:09:51.612
discussed about that you know in
power four and so on, right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15042-0
01:09:52.352 --> 01:09:56.842
But Long story short, the answer
is true there correct.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15076-0
01:09:56.932 --> 01:10:00.132
The correct answer should have
been power four, but it has been

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15076-1
01:10:00.132 --> 01:10:02.982
written in power 27, but by
going by the definition, you

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15076-2
01:10:02.982 --> 01:10:04.532
cannot deny that this is wrong.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15097-0
01:10:04.542 --> 01:10:07.783
You can write it as two, but
when you are doing algorithm and

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15097-1
01:10:07.783 --> 01:10:09.142
this you will not do that.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15107-0
01:10:09.202 --> 01:10:11.392
Yeah, you will be doing it as
tight as possible.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15118-0
01:10:14.672 --> 01:10:17.962
He just clear guys, all of you
real quick.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15125-0
01:10:17.972 --> 01:10:19.522
Yeah, it's already passed 940.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15130-0
01:10:19.562 --> 01:10:20.892
Yeah, when we begin.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15145-0
01:10:22.932 --> 01:10:25.012
We have some time in the end we
will again chit chat, yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15155-0
01:10:28.502 --> 01:10:30.252
Well, so let's look at these
three methods.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15157-0
01:10:30.322 --> 01:10:30.892
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15209-0
01:10:31.042 --> 01:10:34.233
So assume that there was a
problem given to you and you

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15209-1
01:10:34.233 --> 01:10:37.994
have even returned the, you know
pseudo code for it, but you have

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15209-2
01:10:37.994 --> 01:10:41.528
returned it using recursion and
then you have translated like

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15209-3
01:10:41.528 --> 01:10:44.890
this and now we want to solve
this to get the final answer

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15209-4
01:10:44.890 --> 01:10:45.232
right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15216-0
01:10:45.322 --> 01:10:47.922
So we will try to look at this,
yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15221-0
01:10:50.272 --> 01:10:51.562
Recursive tree method.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15235-0
01:10:52.292 --> 01:10:55.430
So recursive tree method or
recursion tree method is a very

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15235-1
01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:56.162
visual method.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15274-0
01:10:56.672 --> 01:11:00.409
It converts the recurrence
relation into a tree and it sums

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15274-1
01:11:00.409 --> 01:11:04.271
all the per level cost to get
the total cost of recursion, or

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15274-2
01:11:04.271 --> 01:11:07.012
in other words, to get that
order of group.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15289-0
01:11:09.202 --> 01:11:12.072
But still look at this and
answer a couple of questions.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15297-0
01:11:12.482 --> 01:11:15.112
Is this a recursive algorithm or
is this iterative?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15299-0
01:11:17.492 --> 01:11:17.692
And.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15307-0
01:11:20.472 --> 01:11:21.112
Yeah, real quick.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15311-0
01:11:22.112 --> 01:11:23.552
It is recursive right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15337-0
01:11:24.212 --> 01:11:27.683
Which line is confirming that
which line in this this line one

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15337-1
01:11:27.683 --> 01:11:29.942
line two, line three, line four,
line 5?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15346-0
01:11:30.312 --> 01:11:33.072
Which line confirms that this is
a recursive algorithm?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15354-0
01:11:34.122 --> 01:11:36.152
Do not line one line 4 right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15366-0
01:11:36.402 --> 01:11:38.972
So I have the same name as this
function name.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15383-0
01:11:38.982 --> 01:11:41.623
That is where it is calling
again and again, but it does

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15383-1
01:11:41.623 --> 01:11:42.272
smaller input.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15401-0
01:11:42.742 --> 01:11:45.310
Here I'm calling within, but
here I'm calling with a smaller

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15401-1
01:11:45.310 --> 01:11:45.942
input than yen.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15416-0
01:11:46.652 --> 01:11:49.402
Right, I've reduced that end and
I have done that very good.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15424-0
01:11:49.572 --> 01:11:50.792
Now, what is the base case here?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15440-0
01:11:52.382 --> 01:11:56.223
Yeah, the base case is not very
evidently written here, but it

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15440-1
01:11:56.223 --> 01:11:56.772
is there.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15491-0
01:11:57.002 --> 01:12:00.698
So what is that base case when
in this three it will run when

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15491-1
01:12:00.698 --> 01:12:04.394
it is 2 it will run when is,
when is 0, what will happen when

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15491-2
01:12:04.394 --> 01:12:07.792
N is 00 greater than zero is
false, so you will not run.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15535-0
01:12:08.772 --> 01:12:13.509
So when N is 0, attached is your
base case in greater than 0 is

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15535-1
01:12:13.509 --> 01:12:17.949
not your base case N greater
than 0 means you will do this,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15535-2
01:12:17.949 --> 01:12:21.132
which is what is recursion
recursive case.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15549-0
01:12:21.482 --> 01:12:24.342
When N is exactly equal to zero,
that is your base case.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15560-0
01:12:25.522 --> 01:12:27.812
When you done all of this, did
you get this point?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15565-0
01:12:28.182 --> 01:12:28.492
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15583-0
01:12:28.502 --> 01:12:31.258
In other words, like what Gopi
says, it can be and less than or

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15583-1
01:12:31.258 --> 01:12:31.732
equal to 0.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15601-0
01:12:32.142 --> 01:12:35.646
The opposite of this will become
your base case, chilienne equal

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15601-1
01:12:35.646 --> 01:12:36.832
to 1 not be base case.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15620-0
01:12:36.842 --> 01:12:40.705
No, because it'll run here right
when N is 11, is greater than

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15620-1
01:12:40.705 --> 01:12:41.012
zero.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15626-0
01:12:41.022 --> 01:12:42.012
So I'll go print one.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15630-0
01:12:42.022 --> 01:12:42.622
I'll go here.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15650-0
01:12:42.632 --> 01:12:46.032
I'll execute so whenever you
enter into this block, it means

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15650-1
01:12:46.032 --> 01:12:48.262
you are in the recursive case,
correct?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15656-0
01:12:49.952 --> 01:12:51.242
No, this is not infinite loop.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15664-0
01:12:51.252 --> 01:12:52.352
No, there is no problems here.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15676-0
01:12:53.622 --> 01:12:56.512
Yeah, this is a recursive
algorithm to print some numbers.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15687-0
01:12:56.522 --> 01:12:59.242
So now let's try to visualize
what's happened.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15695-0
01:13:00.162 --> 01:13:01.562
Let me take N value as three.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15728-0
01:13:03.562 --> 01:13:07.093
Who initially print numbers of
trees being called three is

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15728-1
01:13:07.093 --> 01:13:10.923
greater than zero, so I go into
this loop, meaning which case I

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15728-2
01:13:10.923 --> 01:13:11.282
am in.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15743-0
01:13:12.522 --> 01:13:16.029
When I go go into this loop, I
mean base case or am I in

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15743-1
01:13:16.029 --> 01:13:16.952
recursive case?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15751-0
01:13:20.542 --> 01:13:23.482
Yeah, I'm in recursive case,
right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15778-0
01:13:23.552 --> 01:13:26.629
So I go ahead and print that
three and then I go print

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15778-1
01:13:26.629 --> 01:13:29.202
numbers of 3 -, 1 is 2, so I
call that again.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15797-0
01:13:29.272 --> 01:13:33.350
I go back and with the number 2
who is greater than zero, so

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15797-1
01:13:33.350 --> 01:13:35.222
again I'm in recursive case.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15811-0
01:13:35.232 --> 01:13:38.192
I print that number 2 and call
print numbers of one.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15817-0
01:13:39.102 --> 01:13:40.252
I go on top again.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15822-0
01:13:40.262 --> 01:13:41.572
I call it now.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15856-0
01:13:41.582 --> 01:13:45.390
Again, one is greater than zero,
so I print that number one and I

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15856-1
01:13:45.390 --> 01:13:49.025
call this function print numbers
of 1 -, 1 which is 0, and now

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15856-2
01:13:49.025 --> 01:13:50.872
zero greater than zero is false.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15863-0
01:13:50.942 --> 01:13:52.232
So my algorithm ends there.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15872-0
01:13:53.352 --> 01:13:56.002
Great so far north is equal to
three.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15881-0
01:13:57.282 --> 01:13:58.882
How many levels are here?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15891-0
01:13:59.832 --> 01:14:04.432
1234 What is the base case here?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15911-0
01:14:04.442 --> 01:14:08.161
Base case is N equal to 0,
correct this case when zero is

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15911-1
01:14:08.161 --> 01:14:09.572
not greater than zero.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15918-0
01:14:09.582 --> 01:14:10.952
I'll stop my algorithm right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15950-0
01:14:11.262 --> 01:14:14.581
This particular line actually
has that base case hidden

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15950-1
01:14:14.581 --> 01:14:18.197
insight correct, and whenever N
is greater than zero, I will

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15950-2
01:14:18.197 --> 01:14:21.932
execute this recursion and then
exactly becomes equal to zero.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15978-0
01:14:21.942 --> 01:14:27.215
I'll stop so N equal equal to 0
is the base case pull so this

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15978-1
01:14:27.215 --> 01:14:30.192
how many times have I called
this?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/15990-0
01:14:30.202 --> 01:14:31.912
Or you know how many levels are
there?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16015-0
01:14:31.962 --> 01:14:37.741
1234 levels are there in this so
I can write it as this 3 + 1

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16015-1
01:14:37.741 --> 01:14:39.232
that is my four.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16030-0
01:14:39.522 --> 01:14:43.342
So this three is nothing but my
yen and this one is a constant.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16040-0
01:14:43.352 --> 01:14:45.802
I can ignore it so my
complexities be go off here.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16077-0
01:14:48.052 --> 01:14:52.033
Did you get this point of how
to, you know, visualize what is

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16077-1
01:14:52.033 --> 01:14:56.078
going on in this code and trying
to, you know, get this answer

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16077-2
01:14:56.078 --> 01:14:57.812
four time that is end time.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16079-0
01:14:57.822 --> 01:14:58.232
Exactly.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16082-0
01:14:58.242 --> 01:14:58.772
That's right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16088-0
01:14:58.782 --> 01:15:01.352
Yeah, all of you guys.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16098-0
01:15:01.362 --> 01:15:05.342
Yeah, let's take another example
like this factorial.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16119-0
01:15:05.492 --> 01:15:08.725
So in this case again factorial
is being used with a smaller

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16119-1
01:15:08.725 --> 01:15:10.792
input, so it is a recursive
algorithm.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16125-0
01:15:11.802 --> 01:15:12.842
What is the base case here?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16135-0
01:15:14.792 --> 01:15:15.802
You, SURAJ, will answer that.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16138-0
01:15:15.812 --> 01:15:17.232
Yuvraj prakruti others.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16144-0
01:15:18.462 --> 01:15:20.382
Yeah, here it is.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16159-0
01:15:20.392 --> 01:15:23.232
Very explicitly, given N equal
equal to 1, then return 1.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16170-0
01:15:23.552 --> 01:15:26.252
Otherwise, yeah, this return
line is else right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16182-0
01:15:26.262 --> 01:15:29.922
It is aligned here, so N in two
factorial of North minus one.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16191-0
01:15:29.932 --> 01:15:31.512
So this is the recursive line.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16197-0
01:15:31.942 --> 01:15:34.332
This part is your base, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16199-0
01:15:34.342 --> 01:15:34.812
Perfect.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16210-0
01:15:35.042 --> 01:15:36.892
So what happens when I give
factorial of five?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16225-0
01:15:38.012 --> 01:15:40.582
Why is nothing but factorial of
four for four?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16233-0
01:15:40.592 --> 01:15:42.862
It is 4 in two factorial of
three.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16252-0
01:15:42.992 --> 01:15:45.668
I don't know what is factorial
of three answer that is 3 into

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16252-1
01:15:45.668 --> 01:15:46.272
vector of two.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16274-0
01:15:47.092 --> 01:15:51.935
For two it is 2 into factorial
of 1, for one it is, for one it

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16274-1
01:15:51.935 --> 01:15:53.242
is already known.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16280-0
01:15:53.252 --> 01:15:54.232
Here I have hit the base case.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16282-0
01:15:57.052 --> 01:15:57.212
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16301-0
01:15:59.042 --> 01:16:02.432
And now this one is sent back,
so two into one becomes two.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16316-0
01:16:02.562 --> 01:16:05.452
So this two answer is sent back
as this F of two answer.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16347-0
01:16:05.602 --> 01:16:10.355
So 3 into 2 becomes 6, the six
is sent back here, 6 hours are

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16347-1
01:16:10.355 --> 01:16:13.192
2424 is sent back, 24 into 5 is
120.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16353-0
01:16:13.202 --> 01:16:14.272
I got the final answer.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16381-0
01:16:14.502 --> 01:16:17.712
So how many levels are there and
in each of them you are just

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16381-1
01:16:17.712 --> 01:16:20.663
doing a primitive operation
which is multiply which is 1

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16381-2
01:16:20.663 --> 01:16:20.922
unit.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16390-0
01:16:21.232 --> 01:16:23.152
So there is this 12345.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16400-0
01:16:24.132 --> 01:16:25.522
Pawar N is equal to five.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16404-0
01:16:25.792 --> 01:16:26.942
We had five levels.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16409-0
01:16:27.132 --> 01:16:28.052
So what is the complexity?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16413-0
01:16:30.222 --> 01:16:30.452
Off.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16416-0
01:16:30.462 --> 01:16:30.532
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16421-0
01:16:31.622 --> 01:16:32.752
Brendan had a question, Sir.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16440-0
01:16:32.762 --> 01:16:35.853
If N is equal to 1 in previous
example, can we just still

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16440-1
01:16:35.853 --> 01:16:37.292
ignore one as N equal to 1?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16446-0
01:16:37.302 --> 01:16:37.672
No, you can.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16454-0
01:16:37.682 --> 01:16:40.072
You have to still mention that
as your answer.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16473-0
01:16:40.082 --> 01:16:42.702
Yeah, you have to write it as
yen only because yen is one.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16482-0
01:16:43.822 --> 01:16:46.122
Yeah, but what if N was hundred?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16502-0
01:16:46.802 --> 01:16:50.221
Then your assumption goes for a
task that 100 equal to 1 equal

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16502-1
01:16:50.221 --> 01:16:50.872
to C, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16511-0
01:16:51.752 --> 01:16:53.572
So whatever is in that is your
complexity.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16521-0
01:16:55.962 --> 01:16:57.182
Yeah, this case, all of you got
it.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16524-0
01:16:58.442 --> 01:16:59.202
Guess no, maybe.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16530-0
01:17:03.302 --> 01:17:04.252
Your real quick guys.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16544-0
01:17:06.272 --> 01:17:09.402
But for so these are all very
small code snippets, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16559-0
01:17:09.412 --> 01:17:12.072
So these programs are not even
having more than 510 lines.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16570-0
01:17:12.512 --> 01:17:15.472
But what if a big program is
given which is having recursion?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16591-0
01:17:16.332 --> 01:17:19.395
Yeah, we'll will we be able to
draw such grease for every level

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16591-1
01:17:19.395 --> 01:17:21.262
and try to, you know, get the
answers.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16593-0
01:17:26.142 --> 01:17:26.302
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16609-0
01:17:28.612 --> 01:17:31.762
Real quick guys, we will not be
able to scale this approach.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16640-0
01:17:31.772 --> 01:17:34.399
Yeah, this is the visual
technique, and you're actually

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16640-1
01:17:34.399 --> 01:17:37.120
just crudely drawing the number
of times it is, you know,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16640-2
01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:38.622
calling the recursion and so on.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16665-0
01:17:38.772 --> 01:17:41.494
So this will not be very
scalable only for some small

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16665-1
01:17:41.494 --> 01:17:43.662
code snippets we will be able to
use this.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16680-0
01:17:44.692 --> 01:17:47.546
So that is why we have another
method which is called the

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16680-1
01:17:47.546 --> 01:17:49.022
iterative substitution method.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16697-0
01:17:50.832 --> 01:17:53.665
So the iterative substitution
method is also known as the

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16697-1
01:17:53.665 --> 01:17:54.642
plugin check method.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16718-0
01:17:55.852 --> 01:17:58.638
Substitute the general form of
the recurrence for each

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16718-1
01:17:58.638 --> 01:18:01.222
occurrence of the function on
the right hand side.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16783-0
01:18:01.652 --> 01:18:04.913
It is more like mathematical
induction which you might have

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16783-1
01:18:04.913 --> 01:18:08.392
studied in your school days with
the hope of applying iterative

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16783-2
01:18:08.392 --> 01:18:11.925
substitution that at some point
we will be able to see a pattern

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16783-3
01:18:11.925 --> 01:18:15.240
that can be converted into a
general form and then using the

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16783-4
01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:18.501
base case we will try to solve
the general form and get the

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16783-5
01:18:18.501 --> 01:18:18.882
answer.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16792-0
01:18:20.622 --> 01:18:22.322
Yeah, we'll try to do that.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16821-0
01:18:22.382 --> 01:18:26.350
But before that, let's take that
same code and try to 1st create

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16821-1
01:18:26.350 --> 01:18:28.792
a recurrence relation out of it,
right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16827-0
01:18:28.802 --> 01:18:31.282
30 of north is equal to that one
right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16836-0
01:18:32.402 --> 01:18:35.052
The time taken for this
algorithm is.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16839-0
01:18:36.102 --> 01:18:36.942
It is what?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16852-0
01:18:37.382 --> 01:18:39.012
So first line should be your
base case.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16862-0
01:18:39.082 --> 01:18:40.902
So any guesses what should go in
the first line?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16876-0
01:18:42.142 --> 01:18:45.632
It will be a constant when my
end is 0 correct.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16889-0
01:18:45.642 --> 01:18:48.812
When I pass this program as zero
then that is my base case right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16892-0
01:18:48.822 --> 01:18:49.332
Very good.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16927-0
01:18:49.722 --> 01:18:53.591
So it is a constant one or some
authors also prefer to use it as

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16927-1
01:18:53.591 --> 01:18:57.342
a constant C or a whatever it is
a constant when my base is 0.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16945-0
01:18:58.372 --> 01:19:02.047
When you give a number greater
than zero, then it is 1 plus

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16945-1
01:19:02.047 --> 01:19:03.762
that printing is taking one.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16994-0
01:19:03.832 --> 01:19:07.136
This is one time unit less the
time taken for the recursion,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16994-1
01:19:07.136 --> 01:19:10.604
which is this line right for the
time taken for the rest of the

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16994-2
01:19:10.604 --> 01:19:13.908
numbers I don't know, so I'll
write it as time taken for the

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/16994-3
01:19:13.908 --> 01:19:14.992
rest of the numbers.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17016-0
01:19:16.132 --> 01:19:20.394
In other words, the time taken
to print 5 numbers is 1 plus the

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17016-1
01:19:20.394 --> 01:19:22.392
time taken to Bryan 4 numbers.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17020-0
01:19:22.432 --> 01:19:23.162
Something like that.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17036-0
01:19:23.572 --> 01:19:27.432
So now I have translated this
program into a recurrence

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17036-1
01:19:27.432 --> 01:19:28.052
relation.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17043-0
01:19:29.582 --> 01:19:30.372
Did all of you get this?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17073-0
01:19:31.232 --> 01:19:33.699
Of course, we'll keep doing this
in the whole course whenever we

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17073-1
01:19:33.699 --> 01:19:35.862
write recursive programs, we
will try to convert it like

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17073-2
01:19:35.862 --> 01:19:36.052
this.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17091-0
01:19:37.042 --> 01:19:41.041
Mostly that line, which is the
recursion line, will give you

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17091-1
01:19:41.041 --> 01:19:42.812
this recursive case, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17094-0
01:19:45.182 --> 01:19:45.452
Yes.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17103-0
01:19:45.462 --> 01:19:46.832
No, all of you got this.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17116-0
01:19:47.062 --> 01:19:49.892
Now we are going to solve this
using iterative substitution

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17116-1
01:19:49.892 --> 01:19:50.222
method.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17129-0
01:19:51.422 --> 01:19:55.085
But before that, we will try to
look at the basic substitution

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17129-1
01:19:55.085 --> 01:19:55.492
method.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17135-0
01:19:56.892 --> 01:19:57.822
Yeah, good old days.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17146-0
01:19:57.892 --> 01:20:00.252
Have you come across these type
of problems in your childhood?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17163-0
01:20:01.572 --> 01:20:04.922
Why equal to two X + 4, three X
+ y is equal to 9.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17167-0
01:20:04.972 --> 01:20:05.622
Now solve it.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17170-0
01:20:05.712 --> 01:20:05.902
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17180-0
01:20:05.912 --> 01:20:08.742
What is the value of 1 Apple,
one mango right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17198-0
01:20:08.752 --> 01:20:12.938
All that right, it is called,
you know, solving a linear, you

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17198-1
01:20:12.938 --> 01:20:15.302
know, system of Aggreko
equations.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17206-0
01:20:15.492 --> 01:20:16.332
So what you used to do?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17221-0
01:20:17.692 --> 01:20:21.102
Yeah, you used to bring all of
them in one terms, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17231-0
01:20:21.112 --> 01:20:22.942
So why is equal to two X + 4?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17250-0
01:20:22.952 --> 01:20:26.757
So this why you will substitute
it that now all of them are in

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17250-1
01:20:26.757 --> 01:20:27.422
terms of X.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17257-0
01:20:27.532 --> 01:20:29.442
You'll try to get that and
substitute.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17260-0
01:20:29.512 --> 01:20:30.122
Take it here.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17264-0
01:20:30.132 --> 01:20:30.762
Take it there.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17273-0
01:20:31.072 --> 01:20:32.652
Cancel get X equal to 1.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17298-0
01:20:33.342 --> 01:20:36.688
Now with this value of 1 you
will put it in any of the

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17298-1
01:20:36.688 --> 01:20:39.852
equation for X and try to get
the value of Y right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17313-0
01:20:39.862 --> 01:20:42.389
This was the normal substitution
method that you would have done

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17313-1
01:20:42.389 --> 01:20:42.972
in your school.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17326-0
01:20:43.482 --> 01:20:47.042
Now we are going to do iterative
substitution, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17342-0
01:20:47.272 --> 01:20:49.620
There's also you have done this
is called mathematical induction

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17342-1
01:20:49.620 --> 01:20:49.982
in school.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17378-0
01:20:50.072 --> 01:20:54.562
Yeah, so this is what was our
question, that is STN is equal

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17378-1
01:20:54.562 --> 01:20:59.052
to time taken equal to 1 when it
is a constant you know N 0.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17383-0
01:20:59.662 --> 01:21:02.352
Otherwise it is going to be,
yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17404-0
01:21:03.452 --> 01:21:06.919
1 + 2 and minus one when N is
greater than zero, there's no

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17404-1
01:21:06.919 --> 01:21:07.902
all fear with me.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17419-0
01:21:09.082 --> 01:21:12.599
This is not very difficult, but
if you don't pay attention, this

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17419-1
01:21:12.599 --> 01:21:13.952
might prove to be costly.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17426-0
01:21:13.962 --> 01:21:15.512
Yeah, so 10 minutes.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17429-0
01:21:15.522 --> 01:21:16.622
We will complete this, yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17447-0
01:21:18.502 --> 01:21:23.155
Whenever we have this equation,
first write the recursive case

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17447-1
01:21:23.155 --> 01:21:25.002
and try to start solving.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17450-0
01:21:25.432 --> 01:21:25.642
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17457-0
01:21:25.652 --> 01:21:27.142
What is our aim in solving this?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17476-0
01:21:27.152 --> 01:21:30.596
What do we want to get at the
end of this in someone real

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17476-1
01:21:30.596 --> 01:21:30.952
quick?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17490-0
01:21:30.962 --> 01:21:34.912
Tell me that I had a recursive
program like this.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17503-0
01:21:35.442 --> 01:21:38.892
I wanted to know it's complexity
we go off, you know something?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17517-0
01:21:38.902 --> 01:21:42.312
I don't know what that is, so I
want to first translate this.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17569-0
01:21:42.662 --> 01:21:46.559
I will now fully solve it and
after solving it I want to get

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17569-1
01:21:46.559 --> 01:21:50.457
that order of growth which is N
square in queue whatever and

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17569-2
01:21:50.457 --> 01:21:54.227
then that I will put it in my
big O notation and tell that

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17569-3
01:21:54.227 --> 01:21:57.102
this is my worst case time
complexity right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17575-0
01:21:57.112 --> 01:21:58.782
That is my story, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17585-0
01:21:58.932 --> 01:22:00.502
So now how do I solve this?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17594-0
01:22:00.652 --> 01:22:03.382
So always start with this type
of a.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17618-0
01:22:04.402 --> 01:22:08.451
The current relation right that
second line recursive line

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17618-1
01:22:08.451 --> 01:22:12.706
recursive case started that do
FN is equal to T of n -, 1 + 1

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17618-2
01:22:12.706 --> 01:22:12.912
OK.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17628-0
01:22:14.742 --> 01:22:16.932
Right side, I'll have to keep
substituting, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17644-0
01:22:17.262 --> 01:22:21.312
Do I know what is the value of T
of n -, 1 they know that.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17664-0
01:22:23.702 --> 01:22:26.472
Your friend, I know that it is 2
of n -, 1 +, 1.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17672-0
01:22:26.542 --> 01:22:27.932
This to F n -, 1 +, 1.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17686-0
01:22:27.942 --> 01:22:31.082
I've just rewritten, but this to
F n -, 1.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17695-0
01:22:31.092 --> 01:22:32.662
I don't know what is the value
of it.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17704-0
01:22:33.782 --> 01:22:36.242
So what is T of N -?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17710-0
01:22:36.252 --> 01:22:37.452
One we don't know.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17724-0
01:22:38.122 --> 01:22:41.872
So keep this equation 1 + t of n
-, 1 S equation one.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17729-0
01:22:42.162 --> 01:22:44.052
OK, be very careful guys.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17738-0
01:22:44.422 --> 01:22:46.472
I'll be very slow, but just be
careful.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17746-0
01:22:46.762 --> 01:22:48.542
Yeah, don't go with others.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17753-0
01:22:48.552 --> 01:22:49.472
You know, chat messages.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17762-0
01:22:49.482 --> 01:22:52.992
It might be, you know, confusing
because they already know it.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17779-0
01:22:53.062 --> 01:22:58.209
Yeah, put N is equal to north
minus one in this equation and

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17779-1
01:22:58.209 --> 01:22:59.222
you do that.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17802-0
01:22:59.232 --> 01:23:02.620
What is happening this T of N
becomes for this N you have

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17802-1
01:23:02.620 --> 01:23:04.372
substituted it as N minus one.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17823-0
01:23:05.142 --> 01:23:07.894
Think this right hand side for
this yen you are substituting

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17823-1
01:23:07.894 --> 01:23:08.752
again in minus one.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17836-0
01:23:09.122 --> 01:23:13.332
So this line becomes to F n -,
1, -, 1 Plus this one.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17856-0
01:23:13.342 --> 01:23:18.720
This is already there, so this N
minus 1 -, 1 we came N minus 2 +

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17856-1
01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:19.372
1 right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17865-0
01:23:19.382 --> 01:23:20.552
So T of North minus one.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17887-0
01:23:20.562 --> 01:23:24.818
Now magically you have got so
this answer can I put it here

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17887-1
01:23:24.818 --> 01:23:26.662
instead of this T, n -, 1?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17899-0
01:23:26.852 --> 01:23:29.512
Can I write it as T of n -, 2 +,
1?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17903-0
01:23:30.582 --> 01:23:31.002
Can you do that?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17917-0
01:23:33.632 --> 01:23:35.822
I have done that for this Tom N
-, 1.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17928-0
01:23:35.832 --> 01:23:37.822
I have written a test of North
minus 2 + 1.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17936-0
01:23:38.152 --> 01:23:39.592
There is this plus one already
here.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17938-0
01:23:40.322 --> 01:23:41.712
Correct. Perfect.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17957-0
01:23:42.222 --> 01:23:45.013
So I'll remove this bracket so
it'll be two of North minus 2 +

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17957-1
01:23:45.013 --> 01:23:45.102
2.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17964-0
01:23:46.282 --> 01:23:47.792
OK, now the same problem.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17976-0
01:23:47.802 --> 01:23:49.372
I don't know what is the of
north minus two.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17983-0
01:23:49.382 --> 01:23:50.272
So what should I do now?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17985-0
01:23:50.702 --> 01:23:51.342
On the right hand side?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17989-0
01:23:54.512 --> 01:23:55.122
Yes, Robbie.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17991-0
01:23:55.132 --> 01:23:55.302
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/17996-0
01:23:55.312 --> 01:23:56.422
What doubts you have?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18025-0
01:23:56.852 --> 01:23:59.430
I didn't know what is n -, 1 I
again repeat because this first

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18025-1
01:23:59.430 --> 01:24:01.641
part is very important,
otherwise you'll directly get

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18025-2
01:24:01.641 --> 01:24:02.132
stuck there.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18040-0
01:24:03.232 --> 01:24:05.222
I didn't know what is this team
of N -? 1.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18063-0
01:24:05.692 --> 01:24:09.444
I put N equal to north minus one
in this equation right in this

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18063-1
01:24:09.444 --> 01:24:11.262
first equation I have named it.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18069-0
01:24:11.972 --> 01:24:13.312
This N became N minus one.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18104-0
01:24:13.322 --> 01:24:17.731
This N became N minus one when I
simplified it became N minus 2 +

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18104-1
01:24:17.731 --> 01:24:21.940
1 from where N equal to north
minus one because this n -, 1 is

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18104-2
01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:22.742
what I want.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18142-0
01:24:23.272 --> 01:24:26.585
I don't know what is the of n -,
1 so I want it so this N minus

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18142-1
01:24:26.585 --> 01:24:29.743
one is what I'm putting and this
to FN minus one is directly

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18142-2
01:24:29.743 --> 01:24:30.882
there in the question.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18148-0
01:24:30.892 --> 01:24:32.212
This is what I'm going to solve.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18152-0
01:24:34.472 --> 01:24:34.722
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18164-0
01:24:34.732 --> 01:24:35.902
Is this clear guys for all of
you.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18169-0
01:24:37.272 --> 01:24:38.422
So I got this answer.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18174-0
01:24:38.432 --> 01:24:39.462
I substituted it back.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18180-0
01:24:39.472 --> 01:24:40.242
I got this.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18197-0
01:24:40.332 --> 01:24:42.896
I am again stuck in a place
where I don't know what is the

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18197-1
01:24:42.896 --> 01:24:43.722
of North minus two.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18220-0
01:24:44.532 --> 01:24:47.241
So for North minus two, I'll
again substitute N equal to

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18220-1
01:24:47.241 --> 01:24:49.142
north minus two in this first
equation.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18242-0
01:24:49.392 --> 01:24:52.701
So this left hand side will
become to FN minus two right

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18242-1
01:24:52.701 --> 01:24:54.152
will become minus 2 -, 1.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18261-0
01:24:54.812 --> 01:24:58.240
So this is ends, so I'll
substitute it back here when I

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18261-1
01:24:58.240 --> 01:24:59.832
substitute this back here.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18271-0
01:24:59.902 --> 01:25:02.012
I'll get you n -, 3 + 1 + 2.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18281-0
01:25:02.442 --> 01:25:04.352
These two again N minus, you
know, three.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18298-0
01:25:04.842 --> 01:25:07.012
So now it is St of North minus 3
+ 3.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18307-0
01:25:08.212 --> 01:25:10.202
Again, the of North minus three
value, I don't know.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18319-0
01:25:10.252 --> 01:25:13.162
I'll put N equal to north minus
three into the equation.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18327-0
01:25:13.172 --> 01:25:13.822
Try to get it.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18337-0
01:25:14.492 --> 01:25:16.232
File will tell me what will be
the next answer.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18342-0
01:25:17.652 --> 01:25:18.292
Yeah, real quick.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18350-0
01:25:19.972 --> 01:25:21.292
What will be the next answer
here?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18364-0
01:25:22.912 --> 01:25:25.882
But you are data scientists or
to be data scientist.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18386-0
01:25:26.132 --> 01:25:28.716
So are you able to see a pattern
here without even doing all

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18386-1
01:25:28.716 --> 01:25:30.242
these circles of putting and so
on?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18402-0
01:25:31.052 --> 01:25:33.482
When this was team of North
Minus one, there was a plus one.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18409-0
01:25:33.572 --> 01:25:34.842
There is to FN minus two.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18434-0
01:25:34.852 --> 01:25:38.408
Then it became +2, then from
north minus two became N minus 3

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18434-1
01:25:38.408 --> 01:25:40.932
+ 3, so it should become to FN
minus 4 + 4.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18437-0
01:25:41.802 --> 01:25:42.172
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18442-0
01:25:42.182 --> 01:25:42.732
Is that right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18445-0
01:25:43.302 --> 01:25:43.792
All of you?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18447-0
01:25:43.842 --> 01:25:44.212
Yes.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18471-0
01:25:44.582 --> 01:25:47.795
Then it will be that of north
minus 5 + 5, so that will keep

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18471-1
01:25:47.795 --> 01:25:49.112
on going right like that.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18485-0
01:25:49.662 --> 01:25:52.752
So till when it'll go, yeah,
somewhere it has to stop, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18505-0
01:25:54.292 --> 01:25:58.782
So in general I can tell T of N
is equal to T of north minus K +

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18505-1
01:25:58.782 --> 01:25:59.542
K, correct?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18518-0
01:25:59.692 --> 01:26:01.392
So there is a -, 1, there's a +
1 here.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18550-0
01:26:01.402 --> 01:26:05.854
There's a -, 2 + 2 here, minus 3
+ 3, so on, and here it is a T

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18550-1
01:26:05.854 --> 01:26:09.402
of north minus K + K there is a
constant K, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18562-0
01:26:09.412 --> 01:26:11.602
I can give it as Max whatever
you want.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18567-0
01:26:11.612 --> 01:26:12.522
Yeah, it's a constant.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18569-0
01:26:13.012 --> 01:26:13.542
Yeah. Perfect.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18580-0
01:26:15.572 --> 01:26:18.422
And now when will this algorithm
end?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18585-0
01:26:18.592 --> 01:26:19.892
Any recursive algorithm?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18589-0
01:26:19.902 --> 01:26:22.442
When will that end? Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18600-0
01:26:24.322 --> 01:26:27.462
Going by our usual definition,
base case.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18604-0
01:26:27.472 --> 01:26:27.872
Correct.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18615-0
01:26:27.882 --> 01:26:31.812
Whenever this becomes equal to
my base case, my algorithm will

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18615-1
01:26:31.812 --> 01:26:32.062
end.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18632-0
01:26:33.032 --> 01:26:37.379
So the recursion will end when
the subproblem size reaches the

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18632-1
01:26:37.379 --> 01:26:38.552
base case, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18642-0
01:26:38.562 --> 01:26:40.432
So here always what are you
doing?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18654-0
01:26:40.502 --> 01:26:42.872
You're doing N minus one then N
minus 2 N minus three.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18663-0
01:26:42.882 --> 01:26:44.932
So you are reducing your problem
size.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18692-0
01:26:45.062 --> 01:26:48.252
You are going towards the base
case, so when this n -, K

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18692-1
01:26:48.252 --> 01:26:51.162
becomes your base case, which is
this N equal to 0.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18701-0
01:26:51.942 --> 01:26:53.972
At that time, your algorithm
will stop.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18725-0
01:26:54.362 --> 01:26:58.871
So when north minus K is 0, N is
equal to K so no substitute the

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18725-1
01:26:58.871 --> 01:27:00.952
value of K in equation 2 here.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18737-0
01:27:01.682 --> 01:27:04.112
So wherever K is there, you can
put N itself, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18747-0
01:27:04.122 --> 01:27:05.162
That was your base case here.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18782-0
01:27:06.842 --> 01:27:12.088
So in sort of this n -, K + K,
I'll write n -, N + N SON minus

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18782-1
01:27:12.088 --> 01:27:17.002
N became zero, and this end
remains so T of N is what that

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18782-2
01:27:17.002 --> 01:27:17.252
is.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18814-0
01:27:17.262 --> 01:27:20.851
The whole beauty now Surendran
understands why we had returned

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18814-1
01:27:20.851 --> 01:27:24.383
this base case also when North
is 0, when you substitute that

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18814-2
01:27:24.383 --> 01:27:26.092
here to F0 is the answer is 1.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18816-0
01:27:27.012 --> 01:27:27.292
Correct.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18826-0
01:27:28.472 --> 01:27:30.922
So that one I will write it
here.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18830-0
01:27:31.312 --> 01:27:32.272
That is my base case.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18834-0
01:27:32.282 --> 01:27:33.342
Answer T of zero.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18850-0
01:27:33.352 --> 01:27:36.722
I know when I have zero input,
one is my answer or constant.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18856-0
01:27:36.732 --> 01:27:38.322
I write it here and now.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18891-0
01:27:38.332 --> 01:27:42.426
Can I just ignore that because
it's a, you know, constant or

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18891-1
01:27:42.426 --> 01:27:46.721
lower order term, so N is what
remains so I can put it in big O

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18891-2
01:27:46.721 --> 01:27:48.802
notation and that is my answer.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18898-0
01:27:50.272 --> 01:27:51.212
Did all of you get this?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18900-0
01:27:52.542 --> 01:27:52.942
Yes. No.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18907-0
01:27:54.902 --> 01:27:56.392
Iterative substitution method.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18920-0
01:27:57.742 --> 01:28:00.952
Yeah, again, repeat, you started
with the recursive case.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18936-0
01:28:01.282 --> 01:28:05.226
You kept on substitute the RHS
like this and hopefully to find

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18936-1
01:28:05.226 --> 01:28:05.852
a pattern.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18966-0
01:28:06.282 --> 01:28:10.152
You also found a pattern and you
wrote that pattern out, and then

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18966-1
01:28:10.152 --> 01:28:13.788
for a minute you took a pause
and you retrospect it when will

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18966-2
01:28:13.788 --> 01:28:14.902
this algorithm end?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18977-0
01:28:16.302 --> 01:28:19.172
This this part this N -, K.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/18988-0
01:28:19.222 --> 01:28:22.632
When it reaches the base case at
that time it will end.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19002-0
01:28:23.182 --> 01:28:26.282
So you compare this N minus K
with this base case 0.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19017-0
01:28:27.042 --> 01:28:29.862
So when n -, K, zero, N is equal
to K, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19026-0
01:28:29.872 --> 01:28:30.952
This K goes the other side.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19050-0
01:28:31.222 --> 01:28:35.661
So in this equation now wherever
K is there, I'll substitute NI

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19050-1
01:28:35.661 --> 01:28:38.852
got the simplification I got the
answer date.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19074-0
01:28:39.102 --> 01:28:42.403
Let's go another problem there
is this, you know substitution

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19074-1
01:28:42.403 --> 01:28:45.492
the same, you know factorial
program that we saw earlier.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19085-0
01:28:46.802 --> 01:28:50.252
I write the recursive you know
case of this right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19097-0
01:28:50.262 --> 01:28:52.912
What are the benefits of using
recursion over iteration?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19117-0
01:28:52.922 --> 01:28:55.867
Not much benefits, but there are
a couple of problems where

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19117-1
01:28:55.867 --> 01:28:57.192
recursion is more suitable.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19134-0
01:28:57.702 --> 01:29:00.420
Inherently you are trying to
always divide it and all that,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19134-1
01:29:00.420 --> 01:29:01.462
so it is more suitable.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19139-0
01:29:03.162 --> 01:29:05.272
Yeah, but complexity ways.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19153-0
01:29:05.282 --> 01:29:06.962
It's the same, only that it is
giving right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19189-0
01:29:08.032 --> 01:29:11.958
So here base case is so are you
able to visualize this part when

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19189-1
01:29:11.958 --> 01:29:15.340
if condition is 1, meaning the
base case is 1, then the

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19189-2
01:29:15.340 --> 01:29:17.092
complexity is just one right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19224-0
01:29:17.102 --> 01:29:20.929
You're just having one constant
line, otherwise it is the time

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19224-1
01:29:20.929 --> 01:29:24.149
taken for one place though
factorial of n -, 1, that

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19224-2
01:29:24.149 --> 01:29:28.159
becomes the time taken for North
minus one when N is greater than

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19224-3
01:29:28.159 --> 01:29:28.402
one.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19230-0
01:29:28.472 --> 01:29:29.692
This is a recursive case.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19233-0
01:29:30.232 --> 01:29:30.442
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19240-0
01:29:30.452 --> 01:29:31.082
Is this clear guys?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19263-0
01:29:32.622 --> 01:29:35.408
Again, very important to FN is
not actually calculating the

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19263-1
01:29:35.408 --> 01:29:38.056
value of factorial, but it is
telling you about the time

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19263-2
01:29:38.056 --> 01:29:38.892
complexity, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19287-0
01:29:38.952 --> 01:29:42.155
This view of north is nothing
but the time taken or the order

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19287-1
01:29:42.155 --> 01:29:43.292
of growth, that value.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19289-0
01:29:44.662 --> 01:29:44.872
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19293-0
01:29:44.882 --> 01:29:45.632
Can we solve this?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19298-0
01:29:45.682 --> 01:29:46.792
Yeah, real quick.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19310-0
01:29:48.222 --> 01:29:50.182
I'm not going to do that in the
slide. I have.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19319-0
01:29:50.222 --> 01:29:51.552
A you know a PDF for that.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19324-0
01:29:51.922 --> 01:29:52.742
Let me just open that.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19342-0
01:29:57.072 --> 01:30:01.004
This was written by some TA, so
don't get misled by the you know

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19342-1
01:30:01.004 --> 01:30:02.032
and rating. Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19357-0
01:30:03.232 --> 01:30:05.442
Deal of N is equal to 1 + t of n
-.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19366-0
01:30:05.452 --> 01:30:06.782
One is that the same thing in
the deck.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19386-0
01:30:08.762 --> 01:30:12.172
1 + 2 of n -, 1 and in the base
case it is 1, correct.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19393-0
01:30:12.922 --> 01:30:14.542
It's now all of you are able to
see this PDF.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19405-0
01:30:16.652 --> 01:30:18.930
Call the recurrence equation
using iterative back

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19405-1
01:30:18.930 --> 01:30:19.522
substitution.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19407-0
01:30:19.532 --> 01:30:19.702
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19418-0
01:30:19.712 --> 01:30:21.542
So there's also called as
backsubstitution.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19425-0
01:30:21.552 --> 01:30:23.402
Some people do prefer it this
way.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19454-0
01:30:23.792 --> 01:30:26.733
I try to substitution method or
I try to back substitution

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19454-1
01:30:26.733 --> 01:30:29.874
because you're again and again
substituting backward and using

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19454-2
01:30:29.874 --> 01:30:30.572
the base case.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19490-0
01:30:30.582 --> 01:30:34.060
Yeah, the offender is the time
taken to solve the input of size

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19490-1
01:30:34.060 --> 01:30:37.430
NT of North minus one is the
time taken to solve the input of

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19490-2
01:30:37.430 --> 01:30:38.082
size n -, 1.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19499-0
01:30:38.972 --> 01:30:40.442
So you kept it as equation one.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19508-0
01:30:40.552 --> 01:30:42.792
You substituted N minus one as N
minus.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19519-0
01:30:42.802 --> 01:30:45.002
You know two, then three and so
on.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19533-0
01:30:46.182 --> 01:30:50.952
You founder base case in my
example I had kept it as OK.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19545-0
01:30:50.962 --> 01:30:52.132
Here we have kept a test.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19555-0
01:30:52.482 --> 01:30:54.372
Instead of this three and three,
I have kept a test.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19583-0
01:30:54.382 --> 01:30:58.406
I so the recursion will end when
the subproblem size reaches the

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19583-1
01:30:58.406 --> 01:31:02.182
base case, that is when this N
minus I reaches my base case.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19599-0
01:31:02.632 --> 01:31:06.695
Here my base case is actually
one right this part it is 1 here

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19599-1
01:31:06.695 --> 01:31:07.082
right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19608-0
01:31:07.452 --> 01:31:10.552
So I go there, compare them
right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19627-0
01:31:10.642 --> 01:31:13.491
So when North minus one is equal
to I this I can be taken that

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19627-1
01:31:13.491 --> 01:31:13.672
set.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19638-0
01:31:13.802 --> 01:31:16.542
So I you know is nothing but n
-, 1.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19659-0
01:31:17.002 --> 01:31:20.225
So wherever I had I I
substituted that right and again

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19659-1
01:31:20.225 --> 01:31:21.632
for those simplify them.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19690-0
01:31:22.102 --> 01:31:26.539
So this I and I get cancelled,
so it is to F1 to FN is nothing

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19690-1
01:31:26.539 --> 01:31:30.202
but your base case answer, which
is this one right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19713-0
01:31:30.212 --> 01:31:34.631
I substituted back this part and
the rest of it already remains

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19713-1
01:31:34.631 --> 01:31:37.532
right, so this one and one got
cancelled.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19722-0
01:31:37.542 --> 01:31:39.882
Remaining is yen, so this is
your final answer.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19732-0
01:31:42.082 --> 01:31:43.592
Yeah, all of you got this part.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19743-0
01:31:43.602 --> 01:31:45.752
I'll be uploading this PDF also,
don't worry about it.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19745-0
01:31:45.842 --> 01:31:45.982
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19748-0
01:31:47.142 --> 01:31:47.372
Yes.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19779-0
01:31:47.382 --> 01:31:50.513
No, it is the exact same thing
what I did in slide for the

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19779-1
01:31:50.513 --> 01:31:53.910
other problem, which is the same
thing, there's no maybe or any

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19779-2
01:31:53.910 --> 01:31:54.282
doubts.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19810-0
01:31:54.912 --> 01:31:57.903
Same thing, you're again again
substituting, getting a general

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19810-1
01:31:57.903 --> 01:32:00.610
pattern like this, then using
your base case and further

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19810-2
01:32:00.610 --> 01:32:02.462
substituting to get your final
answer.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19829-0
01:32:03.822 --> 01:32:07.049
Well, let me open another PDF
for you, which is some other

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19829-1
01:32:07.049 --> 01:32:08.472
recurrence relation right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19859-0
01:32:08.482 --> 01:32:11.281
There is some other recurrent
relation we try to, you know,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19859-1
01:32:11.281 --> 01:32:13.986
keep substituting and you know
with the hope of getting a

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19859-2
01:32:13.986 --> 01:32:16.272
general statement, we got the
general statement.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19878-0
01:32:16.282 --> 01:32:20.280
We compared it, but after
comparing when I got that I or K

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19878-1
01:32:20.280 --> 01:32:22.652
value, yeah, this is that
example.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19888-0
01:32:22.802 --> 01:32:25.482
Yeah, come with that is an
example here.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19931-0
01:32:25.582 --> 01:32:28.980
So I got I equal to some value
that you know after comparing

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19931-1
01:32:28.980 --> 01:32:32.044
with base case I'm again
resuting that in this general

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19931-2
01:32:32.044 --> 01:32:35.052
form but after substituting also
I'm getting a lot of

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19931-3
01:32:35.052 --> 01:32:36.222
sophistication right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19944-0
01:32:36.612 --> 01:32:39.022
I have your N plus One North
minus two and so on.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19951-0
01:32:39.532 --> 01:32:41.422
And then this alone is my base
case.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19957-0
01:32:41.432 --> 01:32:42.252
But what about the others?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19971-0
01:32:44.032 --> 01:32:46.412
N + n -, 1 +, n -, 2 up to one.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/19975-0
01:32:47.232 --> 01:32:48.112
What does this actually?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20007-0
01:32:50.262 --> 01:32:53.767
Some of Austin numbers correct
in your normal math it is called

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20007-1
01:32:53.767 --> 01:32:57.054
the sum of the first N natural
numbers and it is given by a

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20007-2
01:32:57.054 --> 01:32:57.492
formula.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20035-0
01:32:58.262 --> 01:33:01.902
It is nothing but yarn into N
plus one by two again N into N

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20035-1
01:33:01.902 --> 01:33:03.692
becomes N square plus en user.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20046-0
01:33:03.702 --> 01:33:07.695
You know, further simplify you
get N square as the complexity

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20046-1
01:33:07.695 --> 01:33:08.082
right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20056-0
01:33:08.092 --> 01:33:09.562
But here it was not so trivial.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20074-0
01:33:09.572 --> 01:33:14.356
Right after you substituted
your, you know that constant IR

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20074-1
01:33:14.356 --> 01:33:15.632
K value in your.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20079-0
01:33:15.642 --> 01:33:16.902
You know general form.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20093-0
01:33:18.022 --> 01:33:21.088
Again, you had to do a lot of
simplification and then you got

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20093-1
01:33:21.088 --> 01:33:21.632
the answer.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20105-0
01:33:22.712 --> 01:33:24.642
And what if someone doesn't know
this part?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20126-0
01:33:24.732 --> 01:33:28.554
If they don't know that the sum
of US 10 numbers is you know

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20126-1
01:33:28.554 --> 01:33:31.312
this, then also there is a
problem correct.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20134-0
01:33:33.522 --> 01:33:33.792
Yes.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20137-0
01:33:33.802 --> 01:33:35.002
No, read all of you get this
part.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20152-0
01:33:38.012 --> 01:33:43.462
Yeah, iterative substitution
method start with the recursion.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20154-0
01:33:43.472 --> 01:33:44.082
Keep going.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20159-0
01:33:44.092 --> 01:33:45.162
Find a general pattern.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20174-0
01:33:45.432 --> 01:33:49.719
Use the base case and further
try to simplify and get the

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20174-1
01:33:49.719 --> 01:33:50.902
order of growth.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20176-0
01:33:53.032 --> 01:33:53.292
Pull.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20189-0
01:33:56.232 --> 01:33:57.682
Yeah, the NPDF, that is what I
told.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20201-0
01:33:57.692 --> 01:34:00.679
Meaning, after you get the base
case, the simplification is a

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20201-1
01:34:00.679 --> 01:34:01.402
little complex.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20230-0
01:34:01.462 --> 01:34:04.382
You need to have some
mathematical you know you should

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20230-1
01:34:04.382 --> 01:34:07.674
know that some of the 1st 10
numbers is north into north by N

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20230-2
01:34:07.674 --> 01:34:08.842
+ 1 by two right that.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20286-0
01:34:11.252 --> 01:34:14.253
We let me just quickly again
revisit that if it's very

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20286-1
01:34:14.253 --> 01:34:17.581
confusing the first part till
here is it clear days you took

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20286-2
01:34:17.581 --> 01:34:21.183
your you know base case you kept
on substituting in equal to n -,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20286-3
01:34:21.183 --> 01:34:24.402
1 and equal to north minus 2 N
equal to north minus three.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20289-0
01:34:24.412 --> 01:34:25.192
You kept doing it.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20300-0
01:34:25.542 --> 01:34:27.552
Finally, you got this general
form till here.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20302-0
01:34:27.562 --> 01:34:27.902
Is it clear?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20309-0
01:34:32.952 --> 01:34:33.562
Mavani summit.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20311-0
01:34:33.572 --> 01:34:33.992
All of you?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20315-0
01:34:34.212 --> 01:34:34.752
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20326-0
01:34:34.942 --> 01:34:37.092
And after that base general
form, what do you do?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20332-0
01:34:37.502 --> 01:34:38.882
You try to compare your.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20337-0
01:34:38.892 --> 01:34:40.692
You know when this will end?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20370-0
01:34:40.762 --> 01:34:45.171
This end minus N minus one with
your base case you try to get

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20370-1
01:34:45.171 --> 01:34:48.797
your I value and try to
substitute it back in your

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20370-2
01:34:48.797 --> 01:34:49.722
general form.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20380-0
01:34:50.232 --> 01:34:52.832
You substituted it so this part
alone became one.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20388-0
01:34:53.552 --> 01:34:55.902
The rest of it is, as usual,
right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20394-0
01:34:55.912 --> 01:34:57.262
Whatever was there is pending.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20405-0
01:34:57.632 --> 01:34:59.802
So you got this line which was
nothing.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20445-0
01:34:59.812 --> 01:35:05.517
But N + n -, 1 + n -, 2 +, n -,
3 up to one and in Max in your

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20445-1
01:35:05.517 --> 01:35:11.222
school you would have learned
that the sum of first N numbers.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20474-0
01:35:11.232 --> 01:35:14.867
This is sum of first N number
right 1 + 2 + 3 up to north that

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20474-1
01:35:14.867 --> 01:35:17.752
is given by a formula called N
into n + 1 by two.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20498-0
01:35:19.022 --> 01:35:22.324
So you substitute this line with
the formula and now formula

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20498-1
01:35:22.324 --> 01:35:25.572
becomes N into north is North
square plus N divided by two.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20517-0
01:35:26.002 --> 01:35:29.086
These are all constant, so North
Square is the dominant term, so

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20517-1
01:35:29.086 --> 01:35:30.272
that becomes your answer.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20539-0
01:35:31.282 --> 01:35:34.044
But if you don't know this
connection that you know this is

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20539-1
01:35:34.044 --> 01:35:36.392
the formula for having number,
you will get stuck.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20548-0
01:35:36.402 --> 01:35:39.212
Here you will be just be in this
line right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20565-0
01:35:41.952 --> 01:35:47.532
That is why the next thing comes
where how is I equal to n -, 2?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20573-0
01:35:49.902 --> 01:35:52.072
S again the same thing, guys.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20584-0
01:35:52.082 --> 01:35:53.582
Yeah, I don't know why you are
getting confused.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20590-0
01:35:54.452 --> 01:35:55.982
I'm comparing my base case.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20597-0
01:35:55.992 --> 01:35:58.062
Yeah, that is this n -.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20605-0
01:35:58.072 --> 01:35:59.042
I -, 1 with.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20613-0
01:35:59.052 --> 01:36:01.772
This may base case value one
right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20622-0
01:36:01.982 --> 01:36:04.972
When this is one my N becomes I
+ 2.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20638-0
01:36:05.022 --> 01:36:08.232
So this one also goes the other
side and my I becomes.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20646-0
01:36:08.242 --> 01:36:09.572
This too goes the other side.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20650-0
01:36:09.582 --> 01:36:10.452
So it is north minus 2.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20654-0
01:36:12.432 --> 01:36:12.662
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20663-0
01:36:12.672 --> 01:36:13.542
Is it clear Sagar?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20674-0
01:36:13.732 --> 01:36:16.952
All of you others kamboj try to
practice them.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20676-0
01:36:16.962 --> 01:36:17.102
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20686-0
01:36:17.112 --> 01:36:18.502
So I'll upload this PDF also.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20694-0
01:36:18.652 --> 01:36:20.262
It is the same example as we
were doing.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20708-0
01:36:20.272 --> 01:36:22.813
Try to, you know, just, you
know, practice them and then see

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20708-1
01:36:22.813 --> 01:36:23.272
the answer.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20710-0
01:36:27.742 --> 01:36:27.902
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20719-0
01:36:32.532 --> 01:36:33.772
Well, there were a couple of
questions.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20727-0
01:36:33.782 --> 01:36:37.352
Oops, yeah, so the complexity
will change.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20731-0
01:36:37.362 --> 01:36:37.492
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20749-0
01:36:37.502 --> 01:36:40.632
For this question you saw it, it
is North Square for small codes

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20749-1
01:36:40.632 --> 01:36:41.692
we use recursion tree.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20759-0
01:36:41.702 --> 01:36:43.904
For large cores we refer
iterative substitution like

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20759-1
01:36:43.904 --> 01:36:44.112
this.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20762-0
01:36:44.122 --> 01:36:45.082
When we prefer master.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20794-0
01:36:45.092 --> 01:36:48.609
Yeah, that is what we look at
now here we have N equal to T of

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20794-1
01:36:48.609 --> 01:36:51.792
North minus one means we have to
iterate N into N times.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20801-0
01:36:51.802 --> 01:36:53.012
So complexity will be n ^2.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20804-0
01:36:53.022 --> 01:36:53.492
That's right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20806-0
01:36:53.802 --> 01:36:54.072
Correct.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20808-0
01:36:55.012 --> 01:36:55.152
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20810-0
01:36:56.782 --> 01:36:57.052
Cool.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20847-0
01:36:57.602 --> 01:37:01.000
So each of the methods described
above, meaning we have learned

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20847-1
01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:04.239
techniques, the recursive tree
method is a very ADOC method,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20847-2
01:37:04.239 --> 01:37:07.372
meaning you are just visualizing
and it's an adhoc method.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20854-0
01:37:07.462 --> 01:37:08.352
It is a little tricky.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20871-0
01:37:08.702 --> 01:37:11.382
You might you know, for bigger
codes you will not be able to do

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20871-1
01:37:11.382 --> 01:37:11.592
that.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20889-0
01:37:12.522 --> 01:37:16.367
And this iterative substitution
method is good, but it requires

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20889-1
01:37:16.367 --> 01:37:19.852
some mathematical sophistication
in order to solve right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20905-0
01:37:20.022 --> 01:37:23.081
So in between, you know, we
discussing about that formula,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20905-1
01:37:23.081 --> 01:37:23.392
right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20936-0
01:37:23.402 --> 01:37:26.125
Some of numbers if you don't
know or you know if you make

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20936-1
01:37:26.125 --> 01:37:28.519
some mistakes in that
simplification and all that,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20936-2
01:37:28.519 --> 01:37:30.162
your complexity will become
wrong.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20949-0
01:37:30.462 --> 01:37:32.842
So some amount of mathematical
rigor, you need it.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20960-0
01:37:33.552 --> 01:37:35.042
That is why master's method is
there.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20966-0
01:37:35.492 --> 01:37:37.302
The master's method is like a
cookbook.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20977-0
01:37:37.722 --> 01:37:41.252
It is a utility method for
analyzing recursive relations.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/20991-0
01:37:41.662 --> 01:37:43.982
It is useful in many divide and
conquer algorithms.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21022-0
01:37:44.052 --> 01:37:46.888
Forget about this line later in
the semester, we will learn

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21022-1
01:37:46.888 --> 01:37:49.677
about this category and then
it'll strike you for you know

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21022-2
01:37:49.677 --> 01:37:51.142
why this method is more suited.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21028-0
01:37:52.772 --> 01:37:53.842
But there is a caveat here.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21048-0
01:37:55.392 --> 01:37:59.041
This masters method will only
work when the recurrence

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21048-1
01:37:59.041 --> 01:38:00.832
relation is of this format.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21055-0
01:38:02.062 --> 01:38:03.802
Do FN is equal to 8.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21063-0
01:38:03.812 --> 01:38:04.982
This is the recursive case.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21069-0
01:38:04.992 --> 01:38:06.072
Yeah, not the base case.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21083-0
01:38:06.122 --> 01:38:08.112
Yeah, base case is, you know one
not 0.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21111-0
01:38:08.122 --> 01:38:12.333
Whatever we learned, if the
recursive case is is of this

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21111-1
01:38:12.333 --> 01:38:16.987
format, eight of north by B + F
of North, where this A is, you

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21111-2
01:38:16.987 --> 01:38:18.022
know the size.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21127-0
01:38:19.102 --> 01:38:22.731
Or the number of sub problems
and N is the size of the current

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21127-1
01:38:22.731 --> 01:38:23.192
problem.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21146-0
01:38:23.252 --> 01:38:27.500
D is a constant and north by B
is the size of that sub problem

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21146-1
01:38:27.500 --> 01:38:28.512
and F of north.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21165-0
01:38:28.522 --> 01:38:31.330
This part is the cost done
outside the recursion, like

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21165-1
01:38:31.330 --> 01:38:32.402
addition or all that.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21181-0
01:38:33.432 --> 01:38:37.107
Only if this format matches,
then we can apply master's

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21181-1
01:38:37.107 --> 01:38:37.632
theorem.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21187-0
01:38:37.812 --> 01:38:39.592
Otherwise, we cannot apply
master's theorem.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21191-0
01:38:41.222 --> 01:38:41.832
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21193-0
01:38:41.962 --> 01:38:42.772
Apply meaning what?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21199-0
01:38:42.782 --> 01:38:43.852
What do we mean, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21205-0
01:38:43.862 --> 01:38:44.932
So what is this cookbook?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21213-0
01:38:44.942 --> 01:38:46.072
What do we actually mean by
this?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21250-0
01:38:49.192 --> 01:38:52.846
The master's method for solving
recurrence equations involves

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21250-1
01:38:52.846 --> 01:38:56.323
simply writing down the answer
based on whether one of the

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21250-2
01:38:56.323 --> 01:38:57.502
three cases applies.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21270-0
01:38:58.322 --> 01:39:01.825
Each case is distinguished by
comparing FN to a special

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21270-1
01:39:01.825 --> 01:39:04.202
function N power log A to the
base B.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21274-0
01:39:05.742 --> 01:39:06.012
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21278-0
01:39:06.022 --> 01:39:06.902
These are the three cases.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21286-0
01:39:08.242 --> 01:39:11.392
Yeah, small constant epsilon and
all this.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21292-0
01:39:11.402 --> 01:39:11.662
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21312-0
01:39:11.672 --> 01:39:14.569
Just take a, you know, a couple
of seconds and let me know if

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21312-1
01:39:14.569 --> 01:39:16.672
you want to learn this way or a
simpler way.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21336-0
01:39:19.942 --> 01:39:23.367
So in general, if equation
pattern matches this pattern,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21336-1
01:39:23.367 --> 01:39:26.432
then it means that you can apply
master's theorem.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21383-0
01:39:26.822 --> 01:39:30.728
Then you will look at which case
of Masters theorem you are, and

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21383-1
01:39:30.728 --> 01:39:34.153
if one of the cases matches,
you'll take that answer and

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21383-2
01:39:34.153 --> 01:39:37.818
directly write it and Masters
theorem alone will always give

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21383-3
01:39:37.818 --> 01:39:40.162
you the answer in your Theta
notation.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21388-0
01:39:40.462 --> 01:39:41.192
Leave it there.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21399-0
01:39:41.202 --> 01:39:43.272
Yeah, don't change it to be go
and all that.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21425-0
01:39:43.622 --> 01:39:46.298
Yeah, just if you are playing
Masters theorem, this guy will

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21425-1
01:39:46.298 --> 01:39:48.712
always give answer like this and
just use that answer.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21432-0
01:39:49.392 --> 01:39:50.212
Yeah, it is a constant.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21437-0
01:39:51.162 --> 01:39:51.482
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21442-0
01:39:51.492 --> 01:39:52.462
So it we learned it here, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21459-0
01:39:54.262 --> 01:39:58.052
Be the constant is greater than
or equal to 1 and is a constant.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21463-0
01:40:00.122 --> 01:40:00.512
This late?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21473-0
01:40:00.522 --> 01:40:02.472
Yeah, all of you understood
this.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21502-0
01:40:02.902 --> 01:40:05.765
If there's a small constant
epsilon better than zero such

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21502-1
01:40:05.765 --> 01:40:08.629
that F of north is big O of
North power special, you know

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21502-2
01:40:08.629 --> 01:40:09.172
log A by B.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21539-0
01:40:09.242 --> 01:40:13.155
So from now on, whenever I talk
about N power log A to the base,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21539-1
01:40:13.155 --> 01:40:16.707
BI will call it as special
function or got function or say

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21539-2
01:40:16.707 --> 01:40:18.272
visual function. Whatever.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21558-0
01:40:18.282 --> 01:40:21.552
Yeah, that minus epsilon, then
this answer and then you have

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21558-1
01:40:21.552 --> 01:40:23.482
some, you know, constant and so
on.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21568-0
01:40:23.572 --> 01:40:24.622
So do you want to learn this
way?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21572-0
01:40:24.632 --> 01:40:26.032
Or the simpler way real quick,
yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21574-0
01:40:29.232 --> 01:40:29.392
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21584-0
01:40:31.212 --> 01:40:33.032
So basically there are three
cases, guys. Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21606-0
01:40:33.042 --> 01:40:36.519
So the case one characterizes
the situation where F of one is

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21606-1
01:40:36.519 --> 01:40:39.212
polynomially smaller than the
special function.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21615-0
01:40:39.302 --> 01:40:40.612
This is called the special
function.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21672-0
01:40:41.082 --> 01:40:44.688
If your F of North is smaller
than this, then you are in case

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21672-1
01:40:44.688 --> 01:40:48.468
one case two is A1, where F of N
is asymptotically closer to the

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21672-2
01:40:48.468 --> 01:40:52.191
special function, meaning this
first one is smaller, second one

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21672-3
01:40:52.191 --> 01:40:55.680
is close to and case 3, where
the F of North is larger than

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21672-4
01:40:55.680 --> 01:40:56.902
the special function.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21690-0
01:40:57.732 --> 01:41:01.889
Yeah, so this is exact snippet
from your uh, you know, actual

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21690-1
01:41:01.889 --> 01:41:03.432
master's theorem paper.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21697-0
01:41:03.742 --> 01:41:04.792
You want to look at this.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21711-0
01:41:04.802 --> 01:41:07.509
You can also go ahead and do
this, but there is also a

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21711-1
01:41:07.509 --> 01:41:08.592
simpler version to it.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21717-0
01:41:09.192 --> 01:41:10.912
Yeah, but apparently what
happened is.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21750-0
01:41:12.852 --> 01:41:16.266
In the Internet you might see a
lot of blogs and other places

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21750-1
01:41:16.266 --> 01:41:19.791
calling this as advanced version
of Master's theorem, but which

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21750-2
01:41:19.791 --> 01:41:20.672
is not the case.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21764-0
01:41:20.682 --> 01:41:24.222
Yeah, Stence WILP students found
it very difficult.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21814-0
01:41:24.442 --> 01:41:27.387
We actually, you know,
simplified this I had taught it

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21814-1
01:41:27.387 --> 01:41:30.868
to some batch like a simplified
form, but I don't know how in in

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21814-2
01:41:30.868 --> 01:41:33.921
the Internet in a lot of
websites I see this as you know

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21814-3
01:41:33.921 --> 01:41:36.652
advanced version of master's
theorem and all that.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21824-0
01:41:36.662 --> 01:41:38.632
Yeah, but it's exactly the same.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21840-0
01:41:39.282 --> 01:41:43.047
I've just rewritten this
master's theorem to make it more

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21840-1
01:41:43.047 --> 01:41:43.502
simple.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21848-0
01:41:44.492 --> 01:41:46.692
Yeah, all of you real quick.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21854-0
01:41:46.762 --> 01:41:47.472
Do you want to learn this?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21870-0
01:41:48.922 --> 01:41:52.141
If you get this one part, then
all of the other master theorem

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21870-1
01:41:52.141 --> 01:41:52.652
is simple.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21884-0
01:41:53.122 --> 01:41:56.262
Yeah, real quick, all of you
focus just five minutes.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21896-0
01:41:56.272 --> 01:41:58.502
Yeah, this is the format.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21908-0
01:41:59.592 --> 01:42:02.522
Your friend is equal to AT of N
by B + F of N.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21925-0
01:42:03.482 --> 01:42:08.982
Yeah, and this F of N is nothing
but N power K log power PN.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21931-0
01:42:09.922 --> 01:42:12.142
Well, there are a lot of
constants.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21941-0
01:42:12.152 --> 01:42:14.422
OK, there are three cases.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21957-0
01:42:15.452 --> 01:42:19.302
Yes, one is if this log A to the
base B is greater than K.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21968-0
01:42:19.772 --> 01:42:21.592
If this is the case, then this
is the answer.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21992-0
01:42:22.462 --> 01:42:26.153
Otherwise, if log to the base B
or special function is equal to

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/21992-1
01:42:26.153 --> 01:42:28.172
K, then there are three sub
cases.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22013-0
01:42:28.182 --> 01:42:31.879
You are in case two and in case
two there are three sub cases

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22013-1
01:42:31.879 --> 01:42:33.132
based on the P value.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22027-0
01:42:33.262 --> 01:42:36.012
If P value is greater than minus
one, you are in 2A.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22039-0
01:42:36.502 --> 01:42:39.012
If P is exactly minus one, you
are in 2B.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22054-0
01:42:39.422 --> 01:42:42.032
If P value is less than minus
one, you are in 2C.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22081-0
01:42:42.902 --> 01:42:46.979
Kind of this special function
value is less than K you are in

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22081-1
01:42:46.979 --> 01:42:50.202
case 3 and inside case 3 again
based on P value.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22097-0
01:42:50.252 --> 01:42:53.292
If it is greater than or equal
to zero, you are in 3A.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22105-0
01:42:53.642 --> 01:42:55.472
If it is less than zero, you are
in 3.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22117-0
01:42:57.422 --> 01:42:59.052
And make it way simpler for you.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22139-0
01:42:59.102 --> 01:43:03.638
Whenever you get a question
right of this format, if this

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22139-1
01:43:03.638 --> 01:43:07.392
format is matching then you will
do four steps.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22165-0
01:43:07.682 --> 01:43:14.230
As simple as that first step you
will carve out the values of a

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22165-1
01:43:14.230 --> 01:43:19.652
BA&amp;B second step you will
calculate this answer.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22173-0
01:43:19.662 --> 01:43:21.082
Log it to the base B.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22205-0
01:43:22.122 --> 01:43:25.176
Once you calculate this answer,
in the third step, you'll

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22205-1
01:43:25.176 --> 01:43:28.336
compare that with K the moment
you do that, you will get to

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22205-2
01:43:28.336 --> 01:43:30.812
know in which case of Masters
theorem you are.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22216-0
01:43:30.882 --> 01:43:32.292
Are you in case one, two or
three?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22242-0
01:43:33.152 --> 01:43:36.476
If you are in two and three,
then you'll also look at the P

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22242-1
01:43:36.476 --> 01:43:39.302
value and decide on which actual
sub case you are.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22252-0
01:43:39.812 --> 01:43:41.972
4th step, you'll directly take
the answer and write it.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22263-0
01:43:45.102 --> 01:43:47.232
I'll again repeat it, this is
your question.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22270-0
01:43:48.192 --> 01:43:48.972
Four steps, guys.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22274-0
01:43:48.982 --> 01:43:49.432
All of you.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22281-0
01:43:49.442 --> 01:43:50.742
Just listen to me very
carefully.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22287-0
01:43:51.702 --> 01:43:53.952
200% of your concentration.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22293-0
01:43:53.962 --> 01:43:54.912
Just four steps.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22318-0
01:43:55.022 --> 01:43:58.441
It cannot get simpler than this
first step, just like your

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22318-1
01:43:58.441 --> 01:44:02.092
school math, you are comparing
this with your actual equation.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22339-0
01:44:02.332 --> 01:44:08.081
That base case and you know
getting the answer of AB AB that

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22339-1
01:44:08.081 --> 01:44:09.872
is your first step.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22348-0
01:44:10.242 --> 01:44:12.652
Second step, calculate the
special function.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22380-0
01:44:13.182 --> 01:44:17.702
Third step, compare the special
function answer in K and decide

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22380-1
01:44:17.702 --> 01:44:22.221
on which step you are in in the
Masters theorem 4th step, write

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22380-2
01:44:22.221 --> 01:44:23.422
the answer right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22389-0
01:44:25.252 --> 01:44:26.502
Why we call it as Theta?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22403-0
01:44:26.512 --> 01:44:29.193
Yeah, because the Masters
theorem has been designed it in

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22403-1
01:44:29.193 --> 01:44:29.702
such a way.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22409-0
01:44:29.772 --> 01:44:31.202
Yeah, it is by design.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22419-0
01:44:31.552 --> 01:44:33.342
Yeah, the authors have created
in that way.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22435-0
01:44:33.412 --> 01:44:35.642
Yeah, that it will always give
the answer in Theta.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22441-0
01:44:35.872 --> 01:44:37.552
So don't modify that, don't
change it.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22464-0
01:44:37.562 --> 01:44:40.640
There's a lot of history behind
that, so if you are interested,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22464-1
01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:43.142
I'll upload the actual Masters
theorem paper. Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22486-0
01:44:43.152 --> 01:44:45.851
So the whole literature behind
how they created and all that,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22486-1
01:44:45.851 --> 01:44:47.462
so you can also have a look at
that.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22512-0
01:44:47.712 --> 01:44:50.156
So the point is don't change the
answer if you are applying

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22512-1
01:44:50.156 --> 01:44:52.477
Masters theorem, do this, get
the answer and just put it

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22512-2
01:44:52.477 --> 01:44:52.722
there.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22515-0
01:44:52.772 --> 01:44:53.212
Leave it there.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22524-0
01:44:56.022 --> 01:44:58.522
Step one for this equation.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22541-0
01:44:58.532 --> 01:45:02.872
What is the value of a BKB when
someone tell me that real quick?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22558-0
01:45:05.282 --> 01:45:10.058
Real quick guys, you'll compare
this with your be of N is equal

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22558-1
01:45:10.058 --> 01:45:10.282
to.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22576-0
01:45:12.442 --> 01:45:17.802
ATON, B + N, Power K right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22583-0
01:45:18.702 --> 01:45:20.482
Please upload the paper on
Master System.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22588-0
01:45:20.492 --> 01:45:21.002
Yeah, I'll do that.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22601-0
01:45:21.012 --> 01:45:23.592
Yeah, in power bar lock power.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22603-0
01:45:23.602 --> 01:45:24.552
Paul, right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22608-0
01:45:24.722 --> 01:45:25.592
So I'll not show this.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22620-0
01:45:27.542 --> 01:45:28.992
You're going to now compare
this.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22624-0
01:45:29.062 --> 01:45:29.882
Let's do that right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22650-0
01:45:32.702 --> 01:45:38.842
This school is this a so a value
is to this two is this B so B

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22650-1
01:45:38.842 --> 01:45:40.402
values also too.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22661-0
01:45:42.932 --> 01:45:44.302
So I don't know about K&amp;P.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22684-0
01:45:44.312 --> 01:45:48.234
Now I'll have to do that, but
somehow I know that this one is

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22684-1
01:45:48.234 --> 01:45:49.942
ilding me this full answer.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22687-0
01:45:50.412 --> 01:45:52.982
When is that possible? Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22698-0
01:45:56.442 --> 01:45:57.912
Now that is what we are
calculating now.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22706-0
01:45:58.022 --> 01:45:59.312
Yeah, kamboj, that is what we
are.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22723-0
01:45:59.322 --> 01:46:02.882
We are going to calculate lock
power P that P is some constant.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22725-0
01:46:02.892 --> 01:46:03.292
I don't know.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22751-0
01:46:03.302 --> 01:46:06.872
I have to calculate now, but I
know that this full blue colored

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22751-1
01:46:06.872 --> 01:46:08.992
circle term is giving me answer
of 1.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22754-0
01:46:09.002 --> 01:46:09.802
When is that possible?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22757-0
01:46:11.072 --> 01:46:11.622
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22767-0
01:46:11.992 --> 01:46:15.542
Anything to the power Zero is 1,
correct?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22792-0
01:46:15.612 --> 01:46:20.377
So if I have N to the power 0
into log to the power 0N then

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22792-1
01:46:20.377 --> 01:46:22.442
this becomes one into one.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22797-0
01:46:22.672 --> 01:46:23.642
One into one is one.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22806-0
01:46:23.732 --> 01:46:25.012
That is what I have answer here.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22814-0
01:46:25.952 --> 01:46:26.882
So what I can do?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22821-0
01:46:26.932 --> 01:46:29.922
I can do that in PR0.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22823-0
01:46:31.632 --> 01:46:31.792
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22825-0
01:46:33.012 --> 01:46:33.282
Yes.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22828-0
01:46:33.292 --> 01:46:33.482
No.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22832-0
01:46:33.492 --> 01:46:34.082
Is this clear?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22835-0
01:46:34.132 --> 01:46:34.252
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22850-0
01:46:35.972 --> 01:46:39.412
And always the recursive case is
what will be given here for us.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22859-0
01:46:39.752 --> 01:46:41.542
OK, not the base case.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22879-0
01:46:41.552 --> 01:46:44.739
Whenever we are applying Masters
theorem, only this line will be

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22879-1
01:46:44.739 --> 01:46:46.602
given pull perfect all of you
got it.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22885-0
01:46:46.772 --> 01:46:47.562
First step is over.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22893-0
01:46:47.572 --> 01:46:49.942
I have calculated ABN KNP.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22904-0
01:46:50.272 --> 01:46:52.442
I've got the values 2200.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22909-0
01:46:52.492 --> 01:46:53.252
What was the second step?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22915-0
01:46:55.632 --> 01:46:55.862
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22940-0
01:46:55.872 --> 01:47:01.034
So we very simple and comparing
this one with this term in power

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22940-1
01:47:01.034 --> 01:47:02.782
K log to the power P1.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22943-0
01:47:03.312 --> 01:47:04.442
When is that possible?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22952-0
01:47:04.552 --> 01:47:06.742
N Power K log to the power.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22970-0
01:47:06.752 --> 01:47:11.742
PN when can that be equal to 1
only when K0P0 right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22993-0
01:47:11.752 --> 01:47:15.424
Because anything to a power 0
right log to the power, 0P

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/22993-1
01:47:15.424 --> 01:47:17.422
becomes one into one that is 1.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23005-0
01:47:17.632 --> 01:47:21.582
So I declare that K&amp;P values
are zero and I stood right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23012-0
01:47:23.632 --> 01:47:24.422
Go first step is over.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23019-0
01:47:24.432 --> 01:47:25.402
What is second step guys?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23029-0
01:47:26.792 --> 01:47:29.332
What step is carving out a BKB?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23036-0
01:47:29.622 --> 01:47:31.932
Second step is calculating the
special function.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23044-0
01:47:32.022 --> 01:47:33.692
You cannot directly decide the
choice right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23083-0
01:47:34.982 --> 01:47:38.030
You have to calculate the
special function or got function

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23083-1
01:47:38.030 --> 01:47:41.285
which is always log to the base
B you have calculators even in

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23083-2
01:47:41.285 --> 01:47:43.662
the exam there will be a
built-in calculator.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23107-0
01:47:43.942 --> 01:47:48.402
You can put log 2 to the base
two, which is one well third

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23107-1
01:47:48.402 --> 01:47:52.712
step, deciding which case of
Masters theorem you are in.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23128-0
01:47:53.182 --> 01:47:56.813
So here in this case my special
function answer is 1 and K

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23128-1
01:47:56.813 --> 01:47:57.552
answer is 0.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23151-0
01:47:58.262 --> 01:48:01.385
So special function log into the
base B is greater than K which

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23151-1
01:48:01.385 --> 01:48:03.582
means which case of master's
theorem I'm in.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23172-0
01:48:05.762 --> 01:48:10.264
Yeah, I am in case one of
Masters theorem does, case one

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23172-1
01:48:10.264 --> 01:48:13.582
have any sub cases case one
doesn't have?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23174-0
01:48:13.792 --> 01:48:14.042
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23197-0
01:48:14.052 --> 01:48:17.954
So we know, yeah, log to the
base if it is less than K you

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23197-1
01:48:17.954 --> 01:48:18.682
are in 3rd.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23227-0
01:48:18.792 --> 01:48:22.346
Otherwise, if it is greater
you're in first case case one

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23227-1
01:48:22.346 --> 01:48:26.145
doesn't have any subcase, so
from simplified master's theorem

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23227-2
01:48:26.145 --> 01:48:27.922
case one this is your answer.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23264-0
01:48:28.022 --> 01:48:31.473
So instead of this log to the
base B which you calculated

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23264-1
01:48:31.473 --> 01:48:35.221
which was one here right second
step put that here and that is

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23264-2
01:48:35.221 --> 01:48:37.542
your final answer that no, no
problem.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23266-0
01:48:37.592 --> 01:48:38.002
Don't be sorry.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23273-0
01:48:39.662 --> 01:48:40.792
Yeah, we'll keep doing that,
Amit.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23279-0
01:48:40.802 --> 01:48:41.532
Yeah, you'll get it.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23285-0
01:48:41.602 --> 01:48:42.772
Yeah, we'll keep doing that.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23289-0
01:48:42.782 --> 01:48:43.322
You will get it.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23304-0
01:48:45.602 --> 01:48:47.402
We are going to do a lot of the
same problems.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23310-0
01:48:48.542 --> 01:48:49.142
That's the example.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23314-0
01:48:49.152 --> 01:48:49.802
All of you clear.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23323-0
01:48:50.192 --> 01:48:51.592
Let's go to the second you'll
get it.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23327-0
01:48:51.602 --> 01:48:51.802
Uh, yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23337-0
01:48:53.472 --> 01:48:54.872
First step you will do now Meet.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23352-0
01:48:54.882 --> 01:48:59.142
Then all of you others try to
get me the values of a BKB.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23355-0
01:49:01.242 --> 01:49:01.442
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23358-0
01:49:01.452 --> 01:49:01.812
Yeah, Meet.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23361-0
01:49:01.822 --> 01:49:02.072
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23375-0
01:49:02.082 --> 01:49:04.602
First try to get me the values
of A&amp;B at least here.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23407-0
01:49:06.982 --> 01:49:15.369
This case AT of N by B less in
power K log to the power P and

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23407-1
01:49:15.369 --> 01:49:19.292
try to get me no answer here.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23430-0
01:49:21.412 --> 01:49:25.326
A values this tool B values this
too, so very straightforward

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23430-1
01:49:25.326 --> 01:49:27.852
A&amp;B value I've carved out
and kept.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23436-0
01:49:28.772 --> 01:49:30.122
Let's be very careful, Amit.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23443-0
01:49:30.172 --> 01:49:32.022
Listen to me very carefully now.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23452-0
01:49:32.032 --> 01:49:33.512
We don't know what is scan P
value.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23458-0
01:49:34.352 --> 01:49:35.322
How do we get it?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23466-0
01:49:35.592 --> 01:49:37.102
We'll have to get it somehow,
right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23472-0
01:49:37.372 --> 01:49:38.332
So let's try to get him.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23483-0
01:49:41.712 --> 01:49:43.802
So this pattern is what we are
following.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23495-0
01:49:43.892 --> 01:49:47.702
But this yen and this is the
same, correct?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23513-0
01:49:47.712 --> 01:49:51.421
That is what this has yielded
you this result, and this is the

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23513-1
01:49:51.421 --> 01:49:51.892
Radio 2.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23520-0
01:49:51.902 --> 01:49:52.772
This is Hilda, 2.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23522-0
01:49:52.902 --> 01:49:53.122
Correct.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23531-0
01:49:54.092 --> 01:49:56.112
So far so good, Amit.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23540-0
01:49:57.412 --> 01:50:00.582
I'll keep asking you and all of
this.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23545-0
01:50:00.592 --> 01:50:01.822
Of course, don't mind about it.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23557-0
01:50:02.352 --> 01:50:05.902
Yeah, you're comparing these two
equations.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23565-0
01:50:05.912 --> 01:50:07.692
They're ideally the same, only
correct?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23582-0
01:50:07.802 --> 01:50:10.432
So a value you got to test 2B
value got to test 2.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23611-0
01:50:10.482 --> 01:50:14.839
This full term has given you N
meaning end to the power K log

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23611-1
01:50:14.839 --> 01:50:18.282
to the power PN has given you
the answer as one.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23615-0
01:50:19.162 --> 01:50:20.282
And when is that possible?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23625-0
01:50:21.322 --> 01:50:23.992
Meaning, just observe this very
clearly.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23635-0
01:50:24.592 --> 01:50:27.492
This whole log term is not there
in this then answer.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23641-0
01:50:27.502 --> 01:50:28.772
Correct, it is not there.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23650-0
01:50:29.192 --> 01:50:30.162
So when is that possible?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23699-0
01:50:31.752 --> 01:50:36.644
When this P is 0, when this P0
locked to the power zero

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23699-1
01:50:36.644 --> 01:50:41.973
anything to the power zero is
one wait, so that log term has

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23699-2
01:50:41.973 --> 01:50:47.039
vanished and here N term is
there, meaning 1 correct N to

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23699-3
01:50:47.039 --> 01:50:48.612
the four one is 1.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23706-0
01:50:48.862 --> 01:50:50.592
So here it is in power one.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23723-0
01:50:50.602 --> 01:50:54.462
Here it is in power 1N power one
into one is YN only.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23730-0
01:50:54.472 --> 01:50:55.692
That is, what is my final
answer?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23738-0
01:50:56.042 --> 01:50:58.552
So can I call case one and P0?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23748-0
01:51:00.712 --> 01:51:01.512
How much did you get this?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23767-0
01:51:02.902 --> 01:51:08.759
You're just closely comparing
and trying to get your AB KNP

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23767-1
01:51:08.759 --> 01:51:09.442
values.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23773-0
01:51:09.452 --> 01:51:11.522
Log term was not there right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23782-0
01:51:12.032 --> 01:51:14.182
Please read the what do you mean
read the.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23789-0
01:51:16.732 --> 01:51:17.722
OK, let's go ahead.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23801-0
01:51:17.832 --> 01:51:21.462
You we'll keep doing and then
you know you will get it.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23810-0
01:51:21.472 --> 01:51:22.642
Otherwise, I'll invite you at
the end.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23812-0
01:51:22.652 --> 01:51:23.142
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23823-0
01:51:23.972 --> 01:51:25.522
So the others, what about all
others?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23837-0
01:51:25.532 --> 01:51:27.442
You got the values of a BKP.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23844-0
01:51:27.792 --> 01:51:28.452
What is the next step?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23848-0
01:51:29.352 --> 01:51:30.402
Calculate the special function.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23854-0
01:51:32.272 --> 01:51:33.602
Yeah, yeah, this is.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23921-0
01:51:33.612 --> 01:51:38.010
This is the you know 2A when
special function value and value

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23921-1
01:51:38.010 --> 01:51:42.478
are equal then there are three
sub cases possible right 2A2B2C

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23921-2
01:51:42.478 --> 01:51:46.947
and two ways nothing but when P
value right so from Step 2 log

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23921-3
01:51:46.947 --> 01:51:51.416
to the base B is equal to K so
you are in case 2 But you don't

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23921-4
01:51:51.416 --> 01:51:53.402
know which sub case you are.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23929-0
01:51:53.412 --> 01:51:54.542
So who will help us decide that?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23935-0
01:51:56.942 --> 01:51:57.892
Yeah, real quick guys.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23943-0
01:51:57.902 --> 01:51:59.672
Who will help us decide P value?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23954-0
01:51:59.902 --> 01:52:01.352
So in my case, who is P value?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23960-0
01:52:01.362 --> 01:52:01.882
P value 0.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23969-0
01:52:02.672 --> 01:52:05.942
So P value is greater than minus
one, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/23980-0
01:52:05.952 --> 01:52:07.462
That is what your master's
theorem told.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24020-0
01:52:07.472 --> 01:52:11.288
If you go back, this is your
slide the go to slide right

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24020-1
01:52:11.288 --> 01:52:15.439
special function is greater than
K you are in case 1 equal to

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24020-2
01:52:15.439 --> 01:52:19.122
then you come back and look at P
and minus ones right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24024-0
01:52:19.132 --> 01:52:20.732
In my case this is 0.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24043-0
01:52:23.402 --> 01:52:26.228
If you read, please read your
friend second line my doubt will

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24043-1
01:52:26.228 --> 01:52:26.632
be clear.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24049-0
01:52:27.482 --> 01:52:28.352
OK, let me do that.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24056-0
01:52:30.052 --> 01:52:31.302
This one you mean this line?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24094-0
01:52:31.732 --> 01:52:35.697
Yeah, let's, you know, clear if
P is greater than minus one,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24094-1
01:52:35.697 --> 01:52:39.922
then to FN is equal to Theta of
North power K log to the power P

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24094-2
01:52:39.922 --> 01:52:42.522
+ 1 N that is, what is the
second line?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24127-0
01:52:45.032 --> 01:52:48.713
So you are in case 2IN case two
you compare P and my P value is

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24127-1
01:52:48.713 --> 01:52:51.762
nothing but zero, so zero is
greater than minus one.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24135-0
01:52:51.892 --> 01:52:54.412
So you're in case 2A, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24142-0
01:52:54.422 --> 01:52:55.332
What did they say?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24167-0
01:52:55.342 --> 01:52:58.660
This is what it told so instead
of this K put your answer K as

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24167-1
01:52:58.660 --> 01:53:00.872
one instead of P put your answer
as zero.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24186-0
01:53:01.712 --> 01:53:05.180
Wait, we should answer is 00
plus one is just one and one is

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24186-1
01:53:05.180 --> 01:53:05.692
just one.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24200-0
01:53:05.702 --> 01:53:09.032
So it is 1 into log in this one.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24216-0
01:53:09.042 --> 01:53:12.230
Also you need not write actually
understood, so you got the

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24216-1
01:53:12.230 --> 01:53:12.602
answer.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24225-0
01:53:13.582 --> 01:53:14.972
Is this clear guys for all of
you?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24227-0
01:53:15.762 --> 01:53:16.032
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24242-0
01:53:16.042 --> 01:53:19.412
So end to the power K and log to
the power P + 1.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24248-0
01:53:19.422 --> 01:53:20.492
I'm not able to understand.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24259-0
01:53:20.502 --> 01:53:22.992
So what are you exactly not able
to understand?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24263-0
01:53:23.002 --> 01:53:24.772
Power means exactly power.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24272-0
01:53:25.102 --> 01:53:27.552
Yeah, just like your in North
Square.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24282-0
01:53:27.602 --> 01:53:28.802
This two something like that.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24287-0
01:53:28.812 --> 01:53:31.392
I've written N power K yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24292-0
01:53:35.452 --> 01:53:35.852
Is it clear?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24296-0
01:53:38.282 --> 01:53:38.542
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24301-0
01:53:38.552 --> 01:53:39.312
I I will pause you.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24308-0
01:53:39.322 --> 01:53:40.412
We will come back there.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24338-0
01:53:40.422 --> 01:53:43.678
Let's proceed and I'm not
exactly understanding what you

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24338-1
01:53:43.678 --> 01:53:47.335
mean by what you didn't get 10
to the power K means N square N,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24338-2
01:53:47.335 --> 01:53:47.792
power 5.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24343-0
01:53:47.802 --> 01:53:49.002
Whatever this K can be any
value.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24349-0
01:53:49.952 --> 01:53:51.422
Yeah, cool.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24368-0
01:53:51.432 --> 01:53:56.127
In this question real quick, you
guys will carve out what is a

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24368-1
01:53:56.127 --> 01:53:57.692
BK&amp;B and tell me.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24382-0
01:54:00.202 --> 01:54:04.472
Remember that this is N divided
by log N yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24391-0
01:54:06.172 --> 01:54:07.402
So no, Step 2 and so one.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24444-0
01:54:07.412 --> 01:54:12.294
I'm just asking you, what is a
BK PA2B2N term is there so it is

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24444-1
01:54:12.294 --> 01:54:17.023
having it is not N squared or
North Power 10 nothing is there

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24444-2
01:54:17.023 --> 01:54:21.600
means it is 1 right N power one
is north so K is 1 and very

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24444-3
01:54:21.600 --> 01:54:21.982
good.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24485-0
01:54:22.352 --> 01:54:26.192
Someone told P is minus one,
meaning when you have N divided

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24485-1
01:54:26.192 --> 01:54:30.096
by log N it is nothing but equal
to writing N into log to the

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24485-2
01:54:30.096 --> 01:54:33.622
power minus one it when it goes
above it goes in minus.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24493-0
01:54:33.952 --> 01:54:35.272
So my P value is minus.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24520-0
01:54:36.672 --> 01:54:39.875
I'll have to now calculate my
special function log into the

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24520-1
01:54:39.875 --> 01:54:43.132
base B I've calculated then the
values I'll have to compare.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24533-0
01:54:45.312 --> 01:54:47.432
I'll compare this special
function and key.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24548-0
01:54:47.442 --> 01:54:51.876
It is exactly same, so I'm in
case 2 right when I'm in case

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24548-1
01:54:51.876 --> 01:54:52.172
two.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24553-0
01:54:52.242 --> 01:54:53.332
Who will help me decide?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24567-0
01:54:53.342 --> 01:54:56.482
I'm in two way to be or 2C will
help me do that.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24574-0
01:54:58.462 --> 01:54:59.052
P value.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24581-0
01:54:59.062 --> 01:55:00.512
So here P value is minus one.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24597-0
01:55:00.642 --> 01:55:03.072
It's exactly equal to minus one,
which is made 2B.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24603-0
01:55:03.462 --> 01:55:04.532
So I'm in 2B.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24624-0
01:55:05.002 --> 01:55:08.207
Take the answer instead of K put
the answer as you know your K

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24624-1
01:55:08.207 --> 01:55:09.072
value which is 1.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24634-0
01:55:09.342 --> 01:55:11.672
So you are end in to log log in.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24642-0
01:55:11.722 --> 01:55:13.972
This is your answer, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24673-0
01:55:15.172 --> 01:55:19.021
Hope is minus one here we
calculate it right when we

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24673-1
01:55:19.021 --> 01:55:23.452
carved out your login, went on
top so it had a PS minus one.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24679-0
01:55:25.652 --> 01:55:26.462
What about this question?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24707-0
01:55:28.032 --> 01:55:33.918
What is a BKP real quick N BR28N
term is there but it doesn't

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24707-1
01:55:33.918 --> 01:55:36.672
have a Squire 10 or whatever.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24715-0
01:55:36.682 --> 01:55:37.812
So it just has nothing.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24721-0
01:55:37.822 --> 01:55:39.412
So N has the power of 1.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24747-0
01:55:39.982 --> 01:55:44.386
What about this term log has a
power which is nothing but P so

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24747-1
01:55:44.386 --> 01:55:47.672
this is 2, whereas this is in
divided by term.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24760-0
01:55:47.842 --> 01:55:51.852
So I SP2 or minus two he is
minus 2.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24763-0
01:55:51.862 --> 01:55:52.212
Very good.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24774-0
01:55:53.692 --> 01:55:55.782
So I have my a BKP value.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24782-0
01:55:55.912 --> 01:55:57.492
I'll calculate my special
function.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24799-0
01:55:57.562 --> 01:56:01.482
That's exactly equal to K, so
I'm in case 2, But I don't know.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24816-0
01:56:01.492 --> 01:56:04.082
I'm in two A to be or 2C, so who
will help me?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24829-0
01:56:04.092 --> 01:56:07.622
P value P is minus 2 which is
less than minus one.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24856-0
01:56:07.972 --> 01:56:13.033
So I'm in case 2C, so 2C answer
just told me it is empower K so

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24856-1
01:56:13.033 --> 01:56:14.852
my K in this case is 1.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24860-0
01:56:14.862 --> 01:56:15.752
So I just put a test.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24865-0
01:56:17.732 --> 01:56:18.172
Simple stuff.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24869-0
01:56:20.002 --> 01:56:20.592
What about this?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24879-0
01:56:22.192 --> 01:56:24.282
Who can tell me what is a BKB?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24885-0
01:56:26.232 --> 01:56:27.222
Amit, keep trying.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24893-0
01:56:27.232 --> 01:56:28.642
Yeah, don't lose hope.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24901-0
01:56:29.712 --> 01:56:35.502
Is 4B2 what is K&amp;P here?
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24913-0
01:56:38.262 --> 01:56:41.482
Is 4BS2 yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24924-0
01:56:41.492 --> 01:56:44.962
Case this three the power of N
is called K, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24932-0
01:56:44.972 --> 01:56:46.782
Whatever is there on top of, you
know.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24936-0
01:56:47.032 --> 01:56:47.672
Yeah, very good.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24946-0
01:56:47.682 --> 01:56:49.842
Yeah, case 3, what is P?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24958-0
01:56:50.702 --> 01:56:53.332
If P is 0, then this whole term
will not be there, correct?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24988-0
01:56:53.342 --> 01:56:56.431
Because anything, the power is 0
log would have not been there

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24988-1
01:56:56.431 --> 01:56:58.932
but here log term is there so it
has a power here.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24991-0
01:56:58.942 --> 01:56:59.802
So P is here.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/24997-0
01:57:00.022 --> 01:57:00.742
What is that power?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25002-0
01:57:01.852 --> 01:57:03.282
It is 1 correct.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25006-0
01:57:03.372 --> 01:57:03.822
Very good.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25011-0
01:57:04.312 --> 01:57:04.772
He is one.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25017-0
01:57:05.892 --> 01:57:07.132
He got a BKP values.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25052-0
01:57:08.172 --> 01:57:11.581
You will then calculate as a
second second step your special

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25052-1
01:57:11.581 --> 01:57:14.878
function, log A to the base B
log 4 to the base two is 2K,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25052-2
01:57:14.878 --> 01:57:15.772
value was three.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25082-0
01:57:15.822 --> 01:57:19.552
You compared them so in this
case the special function value

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25082-1
01:57:19.552 --> 01:57:23.344
is less than K, so it'll be then
it means you are in case 3IN

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25082-2
01:57:23.344 --> 01:57:23.772
case 3.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25088-0
01:57:23.782 --> 01:57:25.062
Again, there are two subcases.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25095-0
01:57:25.472 --> 01:57:26.252
Again, who will help me?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25103-0
01:57:27.012 --> 01:57:28.302
P value will help me decide.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25122-0
01:57:28.312 --> 01:57:33.547
I mean, three or three BP value
here is 1 and that is greater

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25122-1
01:57:33.547 --> 01:57:34.982
than zero, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25140-0
01:57:35.152 --> 01:57:38.402
So I go to simplified Masters
theorem 3A, case 3A.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25148-0
01:57:38.412 --> 01:57:39.602
Case told me this is the answer.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25163-0
01:57:39.852 --> 01:57:43.242
So instead of Ki, put my current
three and Pi put my one.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25170-0
01:57:43.372 --> 01:57:45.002
So my answer is Ncube login.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25177-0
01:57:47.472 --> 01:57:47.692
Right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25182-0
01:57:48.872 --> 01:57:51.472
Another example for you real
quick.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25190-0
01:57:51.772 --> 01:57:55.352
What is a, B. KB?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25207-0
01:57:56.952 --> 01:58:00.615
Ah, practically, it is always
possible to write your forth

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25207-1
01:58:00.615 --> 01:58:02.292
with the second term as uh.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25209-0
01:58:02.302 --> 01:58:02.522
This.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25216-0
01:58:02.532 --> 01:58:04.202
Yes, sometimes it will not be.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25274-0
01:58:04.352 --> 01:58:10.190
I will show you is 2B2 case two
and B is is it P is equal to two

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25274-1
01:58:10.190 --> 01:58:15.039
get full minus two right ABP
values we already got it

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25274-2
01:58:15.039 --> 01:58:20.787
calculate the special function
compare it with K this is 1 this

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25274-3
01:58:20.787 --> 01:58:23.392
is 2 so one is less than two.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25281-0
01:58:23.582 --> 01:58:24.572
So you're in case three.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25285-0
01:58:24.622 --> 01:58:25.192
You don't know.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25307-0
01:58:25.202 --> 01:58:29.693
Are you in three or 3B, right,
so will help you be value be in

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25307-1
01:58:29.693 --> 01:58:31.262
this case is negative.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25319-0
01:58:31.322 --> 01:58:34.292
It is less than zero, so you are
in 3B right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25328-0
01:58:34.302 --> 01:58:37.102
The answer and you are done
right.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25334-0
01:58:37.112 --> 01:58:38.262
How P is equal to minus two?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25349-0
01:58:38.272 --> 01:58:42.817
Because here if you see there is
a log isn't division term right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25349-1
01:58:42.817 --> 01:58:43.162
Oops.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25364-0
01:58:47.262 --> 01:58:51.302
So if you see here, this is
something like return like this.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25397-0
01:58:52.222 --> 01:58:56.818
This should be written as N
square into log to the power

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25397-1
01:58:56.818 --> 01:59:01.898
minus 2 N these two are exactly
the same, yeah, since division

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25397-2
01:59:01.898 --> 01:59:03.672
it is written here no.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25402-0
01:59:04.002 --> 01:59:05.302
So if this became minus.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25420-0
01:59:07.302 --> 01:59:09.462
Yeah, it's no, all of you
understood this, Amit, did you

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25420-1
01:59:09.462 --> 01:59:10.372
also finally understand?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25427-0
01:59:10.652 --> 01:59:13.302
Yeah, very simple stuff.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25442-0
01:59:13.352 --> 01:59:16.597
Yeah, the simplified master
theorem will save you just four

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25442-1
01:59:16.597 --> 01:59:16.922
steps.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25450-0
01:59:17.512 --> 01:59:19.792
Carve out a BKB carefully.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25484-0
01:59:20.152 --> 01:59:23.379
After that, calculate the
special function log to the base

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25484-1
01:59:23.379 --> 01:59:26.934
B third step, compare that with
K either it will be less than or

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25484-2
01:59:26.934 --> 01:59:28.302
greater than or equal to.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25495-0
01:59:28.412 --> 01:59:30.122
If you are less than then you
are in three.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25539-0
01:59:30.412 --> 01:59:34.210
If it is exactly equal, you are
in case two greater than case

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25539-1
01:59:34.210 --> 01:59:37.885
one or case 3 and case two you
don't know if you are in sub

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25539-2
01:59:37.885 --> 01:59:41.193
cases so you will have to go
back to your P value and

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25539-3
01:59:41.193 --> 01:59:42.112
determine that.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25549-0
01:59:42.322 --> 01:59:46.022
Sir, please write the expression
once again with expression.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25557-0
01:59:47.602 --> 01:59:48.872
Yeah, it is just division guys.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25568-0
01:59:48.882 --> 01:59:50.352
Yeah, you can go back to the
recording.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25578-0
01:59:50.402 --> 01:59:51.412
You'll be able to pass it.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25582-0
01:59:51.422 --> 01:59:53.692
It's just division right here.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25591-0
01:59:53.702 --> 01:59:55.492
Yeah, maybe the slide is
confusing.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25599-0
01:59:55.502 --> 01:59:58.292
It's just N square by this.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25606-0
01:59:59.762 --> 02:00:01.152
Yeah, they've given it here.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25610-0
02:00:01.342 --> 02:00:01.952
Everything is.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25622-0
02:00:04.872 --> 02:00:06.572
Well, so there is this last
deck.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25625-0
02:00:06.582 --> 02:00:07.472
This alone will complete.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25627-0
02:00:07.482 --> 02:00:07.762
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25642-0
02:00:07.772 --> 02:00:11.521
So I told you that master's
theorem cannot be used always,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25642-1
02:00:11.521 --> 02:00:11.902
right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25659-0
02:00:12.112 --> 02:00:16.373
That is because in this term,
can you do something like sign

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25659-1
02:00:16.373 --> 02:00:17.072
in, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25663-0
02:00:17.082 --> 02:00:17.632
What is a?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25666-0
02:00:17.642 --> 02:00:18.222
What is B?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25671-0
02:00:18.232 --> 02:00:18.892
What is SK?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25676-0
02:00:18.902 --> 02:00:19.552
What is BI?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25683-0
02:00:19.562 --> 02:00:21.212
Don't know what is this line.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25693-0
02:00:21.662 --> 02:00:25.202
I know AB, but what is this
statement right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25704-0
02:00:25.212 --> 02:00:26.842
This FN is not a polynomial.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25708-0
02:00:27.582 --> 02:00:28.662
N itself is a power.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25716-0
02:00:28.672 --> 02:00:29.922
Then what is the power of that?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25720-0
02:00:29.932 --> 02:00:30.602
I don't know.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25727-0
02:00:30.852 --> 02:00:31.572
So what is P?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25730-0
02:00:31.582 --> 02:00:33.452
We don't know, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25749-0
02:00:33.852 --> 02:00:37.958
So when you have equations like
this, you cannot use master's

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25749-1
02:00:37.958 --> 02:00:38.422
theory.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25755-0
02:00:39.812 --> 02:00:40.322
It's no case.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25759-0
02:00:40.332 --> 02:00:40.852
Are you all getting?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25761-0
02:00:42.692 --> 02:00:42.872
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25765-0
02:00:47.922 --> 02:00:48.342
Yes, no.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25807-0
02:00:49.342 --> 02:00:53.065
So when N is equal to some, you
know sign which is not following

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25807-1
02:00:53.065 --> 02:00:56.503
that pattern or something like
this, then we cannot use you

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25807-2
02:00:56.503 --> 02:01:00.226
know master's theorem we'll have
to go back to our usual case of

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25807-3
02:01:00.226 --> 02:01:01.372
substitution method.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25819-0
02:01:02.682 --> 02:01:04.472
Why do we need to learn all
three methods, Sir?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25840-0
02:01:04.482 --> 02:01:07.757
One and two are OK, as you told
uh method one for simple and why

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25840-1
02:01:07.757 --> 02:01:08.312
do we need?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25843-0
02:01:08.322 --> 02:01:08.562
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25870-0
02:01:08.572 --> 02:01:11.706
So method two is a very robust
method substitution method, but

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25870-1
02:01:11.706 --> 02:01:14.342
you need to have some
mathematical knowledge in some

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25870-2
02:01:14.342 --> 02:01:16.332
cases and case 3 is very simple,
right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25876-0
02:01:16.662 --> 02:01:17.762
You just do four steps.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25891-0
02:01:17.772 --> 02:01:21.772
You are able to solve them for
this log, log N and so on.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25896-0
02:01:21.782 --> 02:01:22.462
We learned right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25921-0
02:01:22.752 --> 02:01:25.169
If you have actually done
substitution method for this

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25921-1
02:01:25.169 --> 02:01:27.894
equation, you'd have spent pages
together to get to the final

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25921-2
02:01:27.894 --> 02:01:28.202
answer.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25936-0
02:01:28.672 --> 02:01:33.173
But here carve out calculate
special function compare and get

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25936-1
02:01:33.173 --> 02:01:34.262
the right case.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25943-0
02:01:34.272 --> 02:01:36.632
Put the answer cannot get
simpler, right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25957-0
02:01:36.732 --> 02:01:38.202
That is where we learn the
master's theorem.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25964-0
02:01:38.212 --> 02:01:40.172
Also, there are a lot of
excises.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25976-0
02:01:40.182 --> 02:01:43.232
Try to give the recursive
solution for these solve it.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25990-0
02:01:46.042 --> 02:01:48.303
Yeah, I'll be uploading a
practice sheet, a Python

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/25990-1
02:01:48.303 --> 02:01:48.702
notebook.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/26001-0
02:01:48.712 --> 02:01:50.692
You can just feel free to, you
know, play around with it.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/26023-0
02:01:50.702 --> 02:01:53.979
It's all related to what we
learned in, you know, order of

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/26023-1
02:01:53.979 --> 02:01:57.312
growth solve these two equations
using substitution method.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/26028-0
02:01:58.462 --> 02:01:59.072
Yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/26041-0
02:01:59.142 --> 02:02:02.152
And for all these prior to apply
the Masters theorem right?

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/26055-0
02:02:02.162 --> 02:02:05.962
Meaning take a BKP values and
try to do all that.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/26060-0
02:02:07.132 --> 02:02:07.852
Yeah, you all do this.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/26075-0
02:02:10.732 --> 02:02:13.680
Yeah, all these examples Nirmal
are from recursive algorithm

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/26075-1
02:02:13.680 --> 02:02:13.922
only.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/26086-0
02:02:13.982 --> 02:02:17.850
This equation that we have got
is from a recursive program,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/26086-1
02:02:17.850 --> 02:02:18.172
yeah.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/26101-0
02:02:21.932 --> 02:02:24.142
That being said, that's pretty
much I had for you.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/26109-0
02:02:24.152 --> 02:02:26.322
Uh, another important
announcement I had.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/26129-0
02:02:26.332 --> 02:02:29.317
So the next week we don't have
a, you know, data structure,

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/26129-1
02:02:29.317 --> 02:02:30.262
class one in class.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/26131-0
02:02:30.652 --> 02:02:31.422
So I will.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/26138-0
02:02:31.432 --> 02:02:32.102
I'm not available.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/26145-0
02:02:33.262 --> 02:02:34.932
Mostly I don't like to do this.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/26164-0
02:02:34.942 --> 02:02:37.715
I don't cancel my classes, but
before even your semester

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/26164-1
02:02:37.715 --> 02:02:38.932
started this was planned.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/26179-0
02:02:38.942 --> 02:02:41.900
Maybe in September or so, I have
some conferences and other, you

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/26179-1
02:02:41.900 --> 02:02:42.492
know, duties.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/26199-0
02:02:42.682 --> 02:02:45.322
So I'm not available next
weekend, so we will not have a

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/26199-1
02:02:45.322 --> 02:02:46.202
class next weekend.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/26202-0
02:02:46.212 --> 02:02:46.832
You'll be free.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/26209-0
02:02:47.162 --> 02:02:48.272
I'll get it rescheduled.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/26218-0
02:02:48.642 --> 02:02:51.492
And that class compensation, we
will have some time later.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/26230-0
02:02:51.662 --> 02:02:53.952
Yeah, some time on the next
Sunday or sometime later.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/26232-0
02:02:54.762 --> 02:02:55.072
Cool.

33fa973c-fc76-4d2e-98b1-035301a2df44/26238-0
02:02:55.642 --> 02:02:56.922
Let me just stop the recording.
