503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/73-0
00:00:14.418 --> 00:00:14.728
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/95-0
00:00:14.738 --> 00:00:17.254
So as usual, we'll just wait for
a couple of more minutes and

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/95-1
00:00:17.254 --> 00:00:18.188
then we'll get started.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/111-0
00:00:29.298 --> 00:00:30.768
So what did you guys do the last
week?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/117-0
00:00:31.838 --> 00:00:32.848
You didn't have a glass, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/125-0
00:00:42.678 --> 00:00:43.228
Nice.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/127-0
00:00:43.238 --> 00:00:43.368
OK.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/151-0
00:00:45.098 --> 00:00:48.229
And still hoping for that one
student who says, you know, I

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/151-1
00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:50.578
use those two hours to, you
know, study DSD.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/166-0
00:00:53.158 --> 00:00:55.218
Other PPT for today's session
available in canvas.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/172-0
00:00:55.228 --> 00:00:55.708
Yet no.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/187-0
00:00:55.718 --> 00:00:58.553
So as I told Rajesh, so it will
always be available after the

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/187-1
00:00:58.553 --> 00:00:58.828
class.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/214-0
00:00:59.298 --> 00:01:02.029
Yeah, immediately after the
class, maybe like within 5 to 10

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/214-1
00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:04.448
minutes after the class end,
there will be available.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/225-0
00:01:09.938 --> 00:01:11.968
Let me also quickly share the
screen.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/233-0
00:01:23.318 --> 00:01:23.978
Hi, good morning.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/248-0
00:01:52.888 --> 00:01:53.508
Hi, good morning.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/255-0
00:01:58.458 --> 00:01:58.888
No, no.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/267-0
00:01:58.898 --> 00:02:01.068
The solutions for the homework
will not be uploaded.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/288-0
00:02:01.358 --> 00:02:05.109
It's just for you to, you know,
practice and you can verify

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/288-1
00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:06.798
amongst yourself and so on.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/297-0
00:02:06.838 --> 00:02:10.508
Yeah, they're all very trivial
small problems.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/312-0
00:02:10.598 --> 00:02:14.538
So they will not be any official
key that I'll be uploading.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/320-0
00:02:24.828 --> 00:02:25.468
How about today?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/329-0
00:02:25.508 --> 00:02:26.718
Do you have a full day class
today?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/340-0
00:02:33.088 --> 00:02:33.728
Hi, good morning.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/342-0
00:02:35.158 --> 00:02:35.918
These sessions. OK.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/353-0
00:02:48.768 --> 00:02:49.288
OK, OK.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/369-0
00:02:52.668 --> 00:02:54.610
We'll wait for another two
minutes and then we'll get

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/369-1
00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.898
started.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/376-0
00:03:02.338 --> 00:03:02.648
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/393-0
00:03:02.658 --> 00:03:05.618
Today and tomorrow, we'll be on
track and then we'll follow the

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/393-1
00:03:05.618 --> 00:03:07.238
usual schedule of Saturdays,
yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/433-0
00:03:58.198 --> 00:04:00.488
Did you also get a chance to
look at the practice sheets?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/441-0
00:04:01.488 --> 00:04:02.968
Let me just bring the browser
here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/446-0
00:04:05.128 --> 00:04:05.338
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/452-0
00:04:05.348 --> 00:04:06.618
Let me know once the screen is
visible.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/455-0
00:04:09.858 --> 00:04:10.228
Yes.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/457-0
00:04:10.238 --> 00:04:10.678
No, maybe.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/466-0
00:04:12.788 --> 00:04:15.748
Are uh course canvas page right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/496-0
00:04:15.758 --> 00:04:19.919
So inside this canvas page, the
moment we going to our course,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/496-1
00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.948
you'll also see a new section
called practice sheets, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/509-0
00:04:24.498 --> 00:04:26.938
So these sheets are actually
Python notebooks.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/536-0
00:04:26.988 --> 00:04:30.045
So currently there's only one,
but after two days class I'll be

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/536-1
00:04:30.045 --> 00:04:32.148
uploading another couple of them
and so on.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/540-0
00:04:32.158 --> 00:04:35.048
Right after every class, I'll be
uploading some sheets.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/568-0
00:04:35.558 --> 00:04:37.548
We are all just self practice.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/596-0
00:04:37.558 --> 00:04:40.921
Once you can consider this to be
more like a lab session, maybe

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/596-1
00:04:40.921 --> 00:04:44.075
right, you can just download
them and it'll open it and you

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/596-2
00:04:44.075 --> 00:04:47.386
know Python notebooks and you
can just run each cell you know,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/596-3
00:04:47.386 --> 00:04:48.438
play around with it.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/606-0
00:04:48.638 --> 00:04:50.098
One right, that's the whole
idea.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/630-0
00:04:50.108 --> 00:04:52.870
There is nothing to do with the
exams or there's no lab exam or

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/630-1
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.208
these are not related to those.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/642-0
00:04:54.678 --> 00:04:57.698
It's just for you to just
practice and self try, yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/653-0
00:04:59.868 --> 00:05:00.918
That sound good all of you.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/669-0
00:05:05.968 --> 00:05:08.375
If we don't confuse these with
your assignments and so on,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/669-1
00:05:08.375 --> 00:05:08.988
these are just.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/678-0
00:05:11.458 --> 00:05:12.518
Practice notebooks.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/686-0
00:05:12.528 --> 00:05:14.588
Yeah, just like your lab
programs.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/688-0
00:05:21.708 --> 00:05:21.888
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/695-0
00:05:26.038 --> 00:05:26.288
Cool.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/711-0
00:05:26.298 --> 00:05:28.895
I think it's, uh, it's 35, so
it's good time for us to get

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/711-1
00:05:28.895 --> 00:05:29.248
started.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/725-0
00:05:29.458 --> 00:05:32.488
So Shamshad had a question like,
yeah, we will come back to that.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/727-0
00:05:32.498 --> 00:05:32.868
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/738-0
00:05:32.938 --> 00:05:34.748
So there are some exercises also
on that.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/770-0
00:05:35.238 --> 00:05:38.415
Maybe it's a good idea to try
that, and if you're not able to,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/770-1
00:05:38.415 --> 00:05:41.289
I'll upload some, you know
materials on that, but it's a

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/770-2
00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:42.248
very ad hoc method.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/791-0
00:05:42.258 --> 00:05:46.171
It is not widely used because
you know, for complex problems

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/791-1
00:05:46.171 --> 00:05:49.058
you'll not be able to draw such
trees, yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/807-0
00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.934
Can you walk through the Python
practice you shared yesterday

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/807-1
00:05:54.934 --> 00:05:55.318
towards.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/809-0
00:05:55.328 --> 00:05:55.668
Uh. Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/811-0
00:05:55.678 --> 00:05:55.868
OK.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/820-0
00:05:55.878 --> 00:05:57.328
Yeah, it's it's a very small
sheet.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/840-0
00:05:57.698 --> 00:06:00.785
It it the idea is that you'll
have to just execute each cell

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/840-1
00:06:00.785 --> 00:06:01.848
and see for yourself.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/844-0
00:06:01.858 --> 00:06:02.668
You know what happens?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/847-0
00:06:04.388 --> 00:06:04.638
Cool.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/854-0
00:06:04.648 --> 00:06:05.858
That being said, let's get
started.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/873-0
00:06:05.868 --> 00:06:09.241
So welcome to the third contact
session for data structures and

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/873-1
00:06:09.241 --> 00:06:10.138
algorithm design.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/886-0
00:06:10.408 --> 00:06:13.183
And today we will start our new
module, which is data

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/886-1
00:06:13.183 --> 00:06:14.108
structures, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/895-0
00:06:16.078 --> 00:06:17.328
So what have we done so far?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/915-0
00:06:17.858 --> 00:06:20.903
So if you were there in the last
classes real quick, what did we

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/915-1
00:06:20.903 --> 00:06:21.888
do in the last class?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/920-0
00:06:27.748 --> 00:06:28.298
Yeah, nobody.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/937-0
00:06:30.828 --> 00:06:33.636
It's been a while, but what
exactly did we do in the last

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/937-1
00:06:33.636 --> 00:06:34.218
two classes?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/945-0
00:06:37.238 --> 00:06:38.578
Types of recursive methods.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/953-0
00:06:38.588 --> 00:06:40.108
Yeah, very good master's
theorem.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/958-0
00:06:40.158 --> 00:06:42.158
Yeah, time complexity, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/961-0
00:06:43.388 --> 00:06:43.828
What else?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/987-0
00:06:45.768 --> 00:06:48.679
So we started the course with
this motive of why should we

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/987-1
00:06:48.679 --> 00:06:51.098
even learn data structures and
algorithms right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1026-0
00:06:51.548 --> 00:06:54.475
And after convincing ourselves
that even in data science, and

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1026-1
00:06:54.475 --> 00:06:57.261
then we need data structures and
algorithms, and you know,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1026-2
00:06:57.261 --> 00:06:59.858
problem solving, we started with
what is an algorithm?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1049-0
00:06:59.868 --> 00:07:03.296
The property is the analysis of
it, the time complexity, and you

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1049-1
00:07:03.296 --> 00:07:05.248
know the RAM model and all of
those.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1062-0
00:07:05.628 --> 00:07:09.375
And then we also learned about
how do you analyze algorithms,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1062-1
00:07:09.375 --> 00:07:09.738
right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1077-0
00:07:09.968 --> 00:07:12.808
So if it is an iterative
algorithm, you will write it.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1113-0
00:07:12.818 --> 00:07:16.429
You'll write the pseudo code
right and then you will use your

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1113-1
00:07:16.429 --> 00:07:20.100
counting primitives method and
you will summarize it and after

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1113-2
00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.828
summarizing it you will simplify
it and then we learned about 2

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1113-3
00:07:23.828 --> 00:07:24.178
rules.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1120-0
00:07:24.238 --> 00:07:24.988
Do you remember about that?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1144-0
00:07:30.818 --> 00:07:34.991
Yeah, 2 rolls neglecting the
lower order term and also

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1144-1
00:07:34.991 --> 00:07:37.268
cancelling the constant right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1185-0
00:07:37.278 --> 00:07:40.454
Once you do that, you will get
some answer and that you will

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1185-1
00:07:40.454 --> 00:07:43.213
put it in the asymptotic
notation and in our case we

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1185-2
00:07:43.213 --> 00:07:46.338
agreed that always we'll go for
worst case analysis, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1197-0
00:07:46.348 --> 00:07:49.068
Which is the big one notation
and then the last class.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1226-0
00:07:49.078 --> 00:07:52.005
We broke some myths about, you
know, just because there is 2

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1226-1
00:07:52.005 --> 00:07:54.692
loops, it doesn't mean the
complexity is, you know, and

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1226-2
00:07:54.692 --> 00:07:55.508
square and so on.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1255-0
00:07:55.798 --> 00:07:58.300
And we'll have two
systematically inspect the code,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1255-1
00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.428
and then we went about learning
about recursion and about how do

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1255-2
00:08:01.428 --> 00:08:03.498
you, you know, form a recurrence
relation?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1273-0
00:08:03.928 --> 00:08:06.835
How do you solve that using
Masters theorem and all the

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1273-1
00:08:06.835 --> 00:08:07.978
cases and so on right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1292-0
00:08:08.278 --> 00:08:11.918
So it was just more of a request
goes to the course.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1313-0
00:08:11.928 --> 00:08:14.558
So the first two classes, that
is what we did, but today we

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1313-1
00:08:14.558 --> 00:08:16.268
will get started with data
structures.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1323-0
00:08:17.608 --> 00:08:20.478
We will get started in specific
about linear data structures.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1333-0
00:08:20.578 --> 00:08:21.838
We will learn what is a array.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1339-0
00:08:21.848 --> 00:08:22.508
What is the stack?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1345-0
00:08:22.518 --> 00:08:23.118
What is a queue?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1352-0
00:08:23.128 --> 00:08:23.998
What is a linked list?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1356-0
00:08:24.008 --> 00:08:24.438
And so on.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1371-0
00:08:24.728 --> 00:08:27.788
And then we will wind it up for
today and tomorrow.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1388-0
00:08:27.798 --> 00:08:30.209
Again, we will start with
another data structure like

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1388-1
00:08:30.209 --> 00:08:31.638
trees and then graphs and so on.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1401-0
00:08:31.648 --> 00:08:34.568
This is what we will keep doing
till our mid semester exam.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1414-0
00:08:36.578 --> 00:08:38.218
Right, this is what we did in
the last class.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1417-0
00:08:40.168 --> 00:08:40.538
Cool.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1431-0
00:08:40.598 --> 00:08:42.706
So what are the different
operations that we can do on

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1431-1
00:08:42.706 --> 00:08:42.898
data?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1447-0
00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:47.788
Yeah, you can typically add more
data to a collection right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1482-0
00:08:47.798 --> 00:08:50.436
For example, if there is this
whole class, if there's a

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1482-1
00:08:50.436 --> 00:08:53.498
student that joins today, I can
add this data to this collection

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1482-2
00:08:53.498 --> 00:08:55.288
auto someone is already done
with me.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1490-0
00:08:55.298 --> 00:08:56.938
Don't want to attend this course
anymore.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1517-0
00:08:57.078 --> 00:09:00.158
I can remove the data from the
data collection which is delete

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1517-1
00:09:00.158 --> 00:09:02.895
or remove or he can ask
questions about the data in the

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1517-2
00:09:02.895 --> 00:09:03.678
data collection.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1550-0
00:09:04.248 --> 00:09:07.671
I can ask if such and so you
know person exists or not, or

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1550-1
00:09:07.671 --> 00:09:10.978
you know I can update some
values to it and so on right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1568-0
00:09:10.988 --> 00:09:13.868
In other words, web programmers
and other people call this

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1568-1
00:09:13.868 --> 00:09:15.138
correct operations, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1573-0
00:09:15.508 --> 00:09:16.358
You can create.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1585-0
00:09:16.428 --> 00:09:19.598
You can read, you can update
something or you can delete.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1595-0
00:09:20.148 --> 00:09:21.848
Is there anything else that you
can do on data?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1606-0
00:09:23.578 --> 00:09:26.878
Yeah, ultimately it all boils
down to this, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1614-0
00:09:27.678 --> 00:09:29.228
Do do, do, do data science.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1626-0
00:09:29.238 --> 00:09:31.868
You know, whole analytics
pattern and all that.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1637-0
00:09:32.198 --> 00:09:35.688
But at the end it falls into
some of these buckets, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1664-0
00:09:35.698 --> 00:09:38.798
Either you're curious about the
data, you you do something on

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1664-1
00:09:38.798 --> 00:09:41.448
it, or you are actually deleting
it or inserting it.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1667-0
00:09:41.908 --> 00:09:42.348
Yeah, Amit.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1674-0
00:09:42.358 --> 00:09:43.688
Yeah, update is already here,
right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1714-0
00:09:44.218 --> 00:09:47.125
So either you insert or delete
or you ask questions about it

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1714-1
00:09:47.125 --> 00:09:50.128
right, you either update it or
you search about it you you see

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1714-2
00:09:50.128 --> 00:09:52.368
if there are some patterns
existing and so on.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1721-0
00:09:52.618 --> 00:09:54.408
This is all we can do right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1737-0
00:09:56.258 --> 00:09:59.454
So now based on these
operations, there are several

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1737-1
00:09:59.454 --> 00:10:00.868
data structures, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1775-0
00:10:00.928 --> 00:10:04.792
So there are a lot more than
what we will learn in this

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1775-1
00:10:04.792 --> 00:10:08.932
course right from array stacks,
queues, linked list, doubly

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1775-2
00:10:08.932 --> 00:10:11.348
linked list, trees, heaps,
graphs.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1798-0
00:10:11.598 --> 00:10:16.682
You know, 2-3 trees, 24 trees,
KD trees and you know, red black

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1798-1
00:10:16.682 --> 00:10:18.668
trees and whatnot, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1818-0
00:10:19.298 --> 00:10:22.861
But ultimately our guiding, you
know principle on which data

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1818-1
00:10:22.861 --> 00:10:24.848
structure should I choose,
right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1831-0
00:10:25.018 --> 00:10:26.688
So that would depend on these
operations.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1863-0
00:10:27.668 --> 00:10:31.393
I'm going to keep inserting a
lot of data in my use case, or

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1863-1
00:10:31.393 --> 00:10:34.936
am I just going to search data
or am I just going to keep

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1863-2
00:10:34.936 --> 00:10:36.158
deleting data right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1872-0
00:10:36.168 --> 00:10:38.088
Such type of choice is what will
guide us.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1883-0
00:10:39.398 --> 00:10:41.348
So firstly, what is a linear
data structure?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1900-0
00:10:41.878 --> 00:10:44.593
So broadly speaking, data
structures are classified into

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1900-1
00:10:44.593 --> 00:10:46.118
two types, linear and nonlinear.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1917-0
00:10:47.278 --> 00:10:50.230
So in a linear data structure,
data is organized in a linear

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1917-1
00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:50.618
fashion.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1934-0
00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:56.070
Yeah, examples are are a stack
Q, vector, list, sequence, and

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1934-1
00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:56.468
so on.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1946-0
00:10:56.978 --> 00:11:00.918
And by this linear fashion, do
we mean in memory?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1949-0
00:11:00.928 --> 00:11:01.648
Also they are linear.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1958-0
00:11:04.038 --> 00:11:04.988
What is your thoughts on it?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1967-0
00:11:06.008 --> 00:11:07.958
Linear meaning one after the
other, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1995-0
00:11:08.168 --> 00:11:11.832
So whatever data structures fall
under linear data structures,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1995-1
00:11:11.832 --> 00:11:15.089
they are going to be in a
sequence one after the other,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/1995-2
00:11:15.089 --> 00:11:15.438
right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2011-0
00:11:15.768 --> 00:11:19.419
But that necessarily doesn't
mean they should be next to next

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2011-1
00:11:19.419 --> 00:11:20.008
in memory.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2022-0
00:11:21.228 --> 00:11:24.168
Yeah, let us nonlinear data
structures.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2037-0
00:11:24.478 --> 00:11:27.338
They are organized in a
nonlinear fashion, right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2046-0
00:11:27.418 --> 00:11:30.028
There is some relationship that
exists among the data.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2065-0
00:11:30.498 --> 00:11:33.548
You cannot put all of them next
to next right, like trees,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2065-1
00:11:33.548 --> 00:11:34.428
graphs and so on.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2075-0
00:11:34.438 --> 00:11:36.648
When the time comes, we will
explore them in detail.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2081-0
00:11:36.938 --> 00:11:37.718
Don't worry about it.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2084-0
00:11:38.978 --> 00:11:39.468
Arise.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2130-0
00:11:39.548 --> 00:11:43.316
Arise is the first example of
linear data structure, and he's

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2130-1
00:11:43.316 --> 00:11:47.023
a special guy because not just
conceptually he's linear, but

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2130-2
00:11:47.023 --> 00:11:50.853
even in the memory the elements
are sitting next to next right

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2130-3
00:11:50.853 --> 00:11:53.588
in the true sense they are
linear in nature.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2139-0
00:11:55.178 --> 00:11:56.088
So what is this array?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2159-0
00:11:56.738 --> 00:12:00.036
So Array is a finite set of
homogeneous elements stored in

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2159-1
00:12:00.036 --> 00:12:02.328
adjacent or contiguous memory
locations.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2172-0
00:12:02.698 --> 00:12:06.188
It is represented by a single
name, so break it down right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2178-0
00:12:06.198 --> 00:12:06.948
So what does it say?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2194-0
00:12:07.118 --> 00:12:11.038
Finite, so it is always defined
by a capital N, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2207-0
00:12:11.048 --> 00:12:13.278
You'll have to tell how many
elements do I want.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2227-0
00:12:13.788 --> 00:12:16.758
Is it file elements or is it 50
elements or is it 500 elements?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2234-0
00:12:17.088 --> 00:12:18.478
I need to set that five.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2240-0
00:12:18.528 --> 00:12:19.958
Yeah, it cannot grow
dynamically.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2250-0
00:12:20.168 --> 00:12:22.048
We'll have to set that finite
number.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2259-0
00:12:23.168 --> 00:12:24.988
It is the homogeneous elements.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2266-0
00:12:25.468 --> 00:12:26.538
So what does this really mean?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2274-0
00:12:26.788 --> 00:12:28.258
What does homogeneous elements?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2287-0
00:12:30.298 --> 00:12:32.608
Can I have some number some
elements as number?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2293-0
00:12:32.618 --> 00:12:33.708
Some where's names?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2301-0
00:12:34.218 --> 00:12:36.498
Somewheres, you know not
possible, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2314-0
00:12:36.508 --> 00:12:39.068
So all of them should be of the
same data type.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2335-0
00:12:39.158 --> 00:12:42.341
That is what homogeneous means,
and then they are also stored in

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2335-1
00:12:42.341 --> 00:12:43.908
the contiguous memory locations.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2355-0
00:12:43.918 --> 00:12:47.628
All of them are next to next in
memory as well, and all of them

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2355-1
00:12:47.628 --> 00:12:48.788
share the same name.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2373-0
00:12:48.998 --> 00:12:52.729
So in this case this whole array
is named as a, so this is

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2373-1
00:12:52.729 --> 00:12:53.868
pointed by a zero.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2380-0
00:12:53.928 --> 00:12:55.248
This is pointed by a one.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2409-0
00:12:55.518 --> 00:12:59.410
This is a two and so on, meaning
array indices start from zero,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2409-1
00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:02.148
right and go all the way till
and minus one.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2427-0
00:13:02.718 --> 00:13:07.738
So if it is 5 array indexes will
be 01234 right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2448-0
00:13:08.788 --> 00:13:11.633
If there are any element in that
area, the last element will be

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2448-1
00:13:11.633 --> 00:13:12.078
of n -, 1.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2458-0
00:13:13.208 --> 00:13:15.018
The first element can be
accessed by a zero.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2467-0
00:13:15.028 --> 00:13:16.588
Second, can be accessed by a one
and so on.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2480-0
00:13:17.608 --> 00:13:19.228
So now I have a couple of
questions for you.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2491-0
00:13:20.168 --> 00:13:23.257
I want to access the third
element here, this third

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2491-1
00:13:23.257 --> 00:13:24.148
element, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2497-0
00:13:25.058 --> 00:13:26.118
How will you reference that?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2504-0
00:13:28.138 --> 00:13:29.018
What will I call him?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2520-0
00:13:29.058 --> 00:13:31.748
Because all of them have the
same name, A of two very good.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2531-0
00:13:32.558 --> 00:13:35.028
If I hit directly of two, I'll
go reach this position.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2542-0
00:13:35.038 --> 00:13:36.408
I'll be able to take that
element.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2547-0
00:13:36.878 --> 00:13:37.998
What is the complexity then?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2565-0
00:13:42.278 --> 00:13:45.724
If we want to go ahead and get
this value, the complexity is

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2565-1
00:13:45.724 --> 00:13:46.628
constant, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2568-0
00:13:46.638 --> 00:13:47.128
Very good.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2583-0
00:13:47.138 --> 00:13:49.988
Yeah, because all I'm doing is
I'm doing a of two.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2590-0
00:13:50.098 --> 00:13:51.928
I directly go to that memory
location.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2604-0
00:13:51.938 --> 00:13:55.348
I get that value respective of
whichever position I want.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2612-0
00:13:55.478 --> 00:13:56.648
I can directly go there.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2619-0
00:13:56.698 --> 00:13:59.058
I can get that value right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2632-0
00:13:59.308 --> 00:14:03.468
So getting a value from an array
is not a problem, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2640-0
00:14:04.668 --> 00:14:06.058
But it has its own
disadvantages.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2646-0
00:14:06.068 --> 00:14:06.938
We will come to that.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2650-0
00:14:06.988 --> 00:14:07.238
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2658-0
00:14:07.248 --> 00:14:08.548
When the time comes, we will
look at it.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2661-0
00:14:09.568 --> 00:14:09.758
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2670-0
00:14:09.868 --> 00:14:11.348
This clear guys for all of you
arrays.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2674-0
00:14:13.708 --> 00:14:13.978
Yes.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2678-0
00:14:13.988 --> 00:14:15.148
No, maybe simple stuff.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2696-0
00:14:18.998 --> 00:14:21.914
Just a point for you to ponder
about the problem with this guy,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2696-1
00:14:21.914 --> 00:14:22.188
right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2727-0
00:14:22.978 --> 00:14:25.785
Let's say suppose I had created
an array with five elements or

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2727-1
00:14:25.785 --> 00:14:28.148
five slots, have now put all the
five elements here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2742-0
00:14:28.908 --> 00:14:31.838
I want another element to be put
here, but there is no space.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2750-0
00:14:33.518 --> 00:14:34.258
So what can I do now?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2766-0
00:14:35.858 --> 00:14:39.508
The only option available for me
is to recreate a new array.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2782-0
00:14:40.548 --> 00:14:43.631
There are also chances that in
the memory there is no place

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2782-1
00:14:43.631 --> 00:14:44.248
here, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2800-0
00:14:44.258 --> 00:14:46.585
So next to this there can be
some other you know file or

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2800-1
00:14:46.585 --> 00:14:47.198
whatever right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2805-0
00:14:47.208 --> 00:14:48.218
There is no space here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2811-0
00:14:48.228 --> 00:14:49.318
Maybe so.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2827-0
00:14:49.328 --> 00:14:51.808
In those cases and replace also
not an option, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2843-0
00:14:51.818 --> 00:14:55.386
Krishna, I want all these five
elements plus I want the six

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2843-1
00:14:55.386 --> 00:14:56.398
7th, 8th element.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2876-0
00:14:56.708 --> 00:15:00.579
I don't want to replace anything
right then my only option is

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2876-1
00:15:00.579 --> 00:15:04.264
I'll have to recreate a new
array somewhere else in memory

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2876-2
00:15:04.264 --> 00:15:06.138
which are bigger space, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2908-0
00:15:06.188 --> 00:15:10.283
Maybe say 10 elements or say 100
elements and then I should copy

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2908-1
00:15:10.283 --> 00:15:14.126
all these elements again for
that and then insert my new 6th

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2908-2
00:15:14.126 --> 00:15:15.008
element right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2919-0
00:15:15.018 --> 00:15:16.648
So such problem is there with
arrays.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2931-0
00:15:16.718 --> 00:15:20.928
That is usually say it cannot
dynamically grow or shrink.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2966-0
00:15:22.198 --> 00:15:25.938
I love to write away, define the
number of elements or the

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2966-1
00:15:25.938 --> 00:15:29.615
capital N and once that is
defined dynamically, it cannot

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2966-2
00:15:29.615 --> 00:15:31.898
just grow or it cannot even
shrink.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2968-0
00:15:32.028 --> 00:15:32.398
Shrink.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2979-0
00:15:32.408 --> 00:15:34.498
Meaning, what if I have only
three elements here?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/2989-0
00:15:34.628 --> 00:15:37.708
Then these two are going empty,
meaning I'm wasting space here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3000-0
00:15:38.468 --> 00:15:40.468
So these are the pros and cons
of Aries.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3011-0
00:15:42.138 --> 00:15:44.348
So now let's look into, you
know, something called stacks.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3020-0
00:15:45.898 --> 00:15:46.958
A stack is a container of.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3030-0
00:15:46.968 --> 00:15:48.078
This is again a data structure.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3041-0
00:15:48.088 --> 00:15:49.498
There's also a linear data
structure.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3071-0
00:15:50.278 --> 00:15:53.388
A stack is a container of
objects that are inserted and

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3071-1
00:15:53.388 --> 00:15:56.832
removed according to the last in
first out principle or it is

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3071-2
00:15:56.832 --> 00:15:57.888
also called as Lee.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3089-0
00:15:57.898 --> 00:16:02.090
Four objects can be inserted at
any time, but only the last

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3089-1
00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:03.628
object can be removed.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3100-0
00:16:05.408 --> 00:16:07.318
Getting it right so it follows a
principle.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3105-0
00:16:07.328 --> 00:16:08.078
This is a paradigm.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3124-0
00:16:08.088 --> 00:16:10.950
Yeah, you have to obey this
paradigm whenever you work in

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3124-1
00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:11.938
the stack ecosystem.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3151-0
00:16:11.988 --> 00:16:15.938
In this world, you can insert
anytime whatever you want, but

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3151-1
00:16:15.938 --> 00:16:19.759
only the last one that you
inserted will be the one to get

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3151-2
00:16:19.759 --> 00:16:20.278
removed.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3161-0
00:16:20.288 --> 00:16:23.198
You cannot just remove whatever
you like, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3201-0
00:16:23.208 --> 00:16:27.215
It follows this order of lasting
first out the last one who went

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3201-1
00:16:27.215 --> 00:16:31.099
into the structure will be the
first one to get out, and there

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3201-2
00:16:31.099 --> 00:16:32.518
are some terminologies.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3266-0
00:16:33.408 --> 00:16:38.066
So inserting or adding an item
in this stack is called as

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3266-1
00:16:38.066 --> 00:16:43.286
pushing onto the stack or it is
also called as push and removing

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3266-2
00:16:43.286 --> 00:16:47.864
or deleting from a stack is
called as popping or pop and

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3266-3
00:16:47.864 --> 00:16:53.164
pushing and popping happens only
in one end and that is called as

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3266-4
00:16:53.164 --> 00:16:53.968
top right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3271-0
00:16:53.978 --> 00:16:54.818
So let's see some examples.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3312-0
00:16:56.208 --> 00:16:59.525
They're all day to day examples
that you might have seen, so

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3312-1
00:16:59.525 --> 00:17:03.005
you'll see a stack of plates, a
stack of coins, a stack of box,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3312-2
00:17:03.005 --> 00:17:05.018
a stack of folded shirts, and so
on.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3316-0
00:17:05.028 --> 00:17:05.358
Right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3340-0
00:17:05.768 --> 00:17:09.104
So in all of this, for example,
I now you know want to put

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3340-1
00:17:09.104 --> 00:17:10.348
another shirt in this.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3356-0
00:17:11.788 --> 00:17:15.308
Where can I put it able to the
bottom or middle or somewhere?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3365-0
00:17:15.318 --> 00:17:17.248
Or where is the only place I can
put the shirt?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3370-0
00:17:19.738 --> 00:17:20.028
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3377-0
00:17:20.038 --> 00:17:22.888
Any idea on top always here?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3387-0
00:17:22.898 --> 00:17:24.938
This is where I can put and.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3395-0
00:17:24.948 --> 00:17:26.778
Now someone wants to take a
shirt from here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3407-0
00:17:27.778 --> 00:17:29.178
Which one is the one that we can
take?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3418-0
00:17:30.438 --> 00:17:33.328
Again, the top one right, only
this shirt can be taken out.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3431-0
00:17:33.518 --> 00:17:35.738
I cannot randomly pull this
white shirt or something, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3438-0
00:17:36.438 --> 00:17:38.118
Similarly, a lot of examples,
right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3450-0
00:17:39.438 --> 00:17:41.368
So if you love cooking, you
might have done this right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3465-0
00:17:41.678 --> 00:17:44.964
So after every roti you keep
placing them like a stack here,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3465-1
00:17:44.964 --> 00:17:45.288
right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3482-0
00:17:45.578 --> 00:17:48.476
You keep placing them on this
one, so the stack is growing

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3482-1
00:17:48.476 --> 00:17:48.968
like this.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3518-0
00:17:49.818 --> 00:17:53.030
The height of the, you know, the
pile of proteins are growing and

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3518-1
00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:56.000
when someone is hungry, when
they want to take the roti out,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3518-2
00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.288
they'll take this first roti out
of it, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3532-0
00:17:58.298 --> 00:18:00.368
They will not pull it from the
middle or from the bottom.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3565-0
00:18:00.718 --> 00:18:05.449
They'll take it from the top, so
insertion and deletion both are

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3565-1
00:18:05.449 --> 00:18:09.599
happening when only one end,
which is called the top end

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3565-2
00:18:09.599 --> 00:18:12.438
right and the last one who went
right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3595-0
00:18:12.448 --> 00:18:15.853
So this was the roti which was
last placed here after cooking

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3595-1
00:18:15.853 --> 00:18:19.368
and that is the one first to be,
you know, taken out similarly.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3599-0
00:18:20.458 --> 00:18:21.458
Have you even seen this?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3605-0
00:18:21.468 --> 00:18:21.588
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3610-0
00:18:23.478 --> 00:18:24.468
Ellie maker, right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3642-0
00:18:24.778 --> 00:18:28.915
So here as well, this is the
last plate which was put inside

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3642-1
00:18:28.915 --> 00:18:32.713
and after cooking this will be
the first one to get out

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3642-2
00:18:32.713 --> 00:18:34.748
familiar coin dispenser right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3660-0
00:18:34.758 --> 00:18:37.191
The last one which was, you know
put inside will be the first

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3660-1
00:18:37.191 --> 00:18:37.348
one.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3665-0
00:18:37.358 --> 00:18:38.598
It'll give it out to us.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3668-0
00:18:39.718 --> 00:18:39.958
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3677-0
00:18:39.968 --> 00:18:41.418
Is the motivation clear for all
of you?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3680-0
00:18:42.998 --> 00:18:43.308
Yes.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3701-0
00:18:43.318 --> 00:18:47.366
No, a very simple philosophy
insertion or removal, which in

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3701-1
00:18:47.366 --> 00:18:49.728
this world is called push and
pop.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3731-0
00:18:50.048 --> 00:18:54.106
Both will happen in only one
end, and that end is called as

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3731-1
00:18:54.106 --> 00:18:58.503
top right, whichever was the one
who went last will be the first

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3731-2
00:18:58.503 --> 00:18:59.518
one to get out.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3735-0
00:19:01.458 --> 00:19:01.798
Cool.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3743-0
00:19:01.808 --> 00:19:03.588
That being said, let's implement
this stack.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3749-0
00:19:03.598 --> 00:19:04.438
How do you implement it?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3759-0
00:19:05.638 --> 00:19:07.088
We can implement it in two ways.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3812-0
00:19:07.678 --> 00:19:10.666
Either I can use an array or I
can use a linked list, but we

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3812-1
00:19:10.666 --> 00:19:13.801
have not even learned what is a
link list now, so we will learn

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3812-2
00:19:13.801 --> 00:19:17.034
later about linked list and then
we will see how we can implement

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3812-3
00:19:17.034 --> 00:19:18.308
a stack using linked list.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3825-0
00:19:18.818 --> 00:19:22.022
But for now, let's learn how to
implement a stack using an

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3825-1
00:19:22.022 --> 00:19:22.348
array.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3844-0
00:19:24.088 --> 00:19:28.824
Create a stack, yes, using an
array by specifying the maximum

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3844-1
00:19:28.824 --> 00:19:29.818
size N great.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3850-0
00:19:31.318 --> 00:19:32.008
Something like this.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3867-0
00:19:32.018 --> 00:19:36.088
So is it now a array or a stack
you have just created a array.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3887-0
00:19:36.138 --> 00:19:39.728
We have named it as yes and it
is going all the way from zero

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3887-1
00:19:39.728 --> 00:19:40.308
to n -, 1.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3897-0
00:19:40.618 --> 00:19:41.918
Basically, we've just created an
array.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3919-0
00:19:43.788 --> 00:19:47.359
The stack consists of North
Element array yes and an integer

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3919-1
00:19:47.359 --> 00:19:50.638
variable T right, which is
nothing but the top element.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3941-0
00:19:52.378 --> 00:19:55.638
Aren't they start from zero, so
we initialized T 2 -, 1.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3950-0
00:19:56.718 --> 00:19:58.558
So initially the top is minus
one.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3964-0
00:19:59.178 --> 00:20:02.608
Whenever we add an element, we
keep incrementing that right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3974-0
00:20:02.938 --> 00:20:04.088
It's been incremented top.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3989-0
00:20:04.138 --> 00:20:07.237
We put an element we incremented
element, we put an element and

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3989-1
00:20:07.237 --> 00:20:07.528
so on.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/3999-0
00:20:07.818 --> 00:20:08.988
So we've kept on doing this.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4018-0
00:20:08.998 --> 00:20:13.130
This Violet color means we have
put all these elements now and

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4018-1
00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:14.508
now it is here right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4026-0
00:20:15.578 --> 00:20:17.828
So now I want to insert another
element.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4033-0
00:20:17.878 --> 00:20:18.808
So what should I be doing?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4038-0
00:20:19.338 --> 00:20:19.738
Any idea?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4045-0
00:20:21.598 --> 00:20:22.928
Of course I have some space
here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4056-0
00:20:22.938 --> 00:20:23.628
I'll be able to do that.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4071-0
00:20:25.028 --> 00:20:28.367
So whenever I want to push an
item, what is the operation that

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4071-1
00:20:28.367 --> 00:20:28.898
I'm doing?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4075-0
00:20:29.288 --> 00:20:29.518
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4078-0
00:20:29.528 --> 00:20:30.248
Why t + 2?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4086-0
00:20:31.178 --> 00:20:32.668
I'm just going one place, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4094-0
00:20:32.898 --> 00:20:34.908
So what is T is the top element.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4111-0
00:20:34.918 --> 00:20:38.448
It is always given by the
topmost element, the address of

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4111-1
00:20:38.448 --> 00:20:39.848
the top element, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4134-0
00:20:39.858 --> 00:20:42.618
So in this case, all these
Violet colored are filled, so

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4134-1
00:20:42.618 --> 00:20:44.458
he's pointing to the topmost
element.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4138-0
00:20:44.468 --> 00:20:44.838
Who's there?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4140-0
00:20:45.938 --> 00:20:46.378
Right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4172-0
00:20:46.598 --> 00:20:50.173
He's the potential guy, that
element, which is pointed by

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4172-1
00:20:50.173 --> 00:20:54.180
this T will be the one who will
get popped out when you do a pop

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4172-2
00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:55.228
operation, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4186-0
00:20:55.378 --> 00:20:57.718
So you'll always point to the
top most roti, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4222-0
00:20:59.288 --> 00:21:03.324
So now I want to insert a new
item or in other words I want to

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4222-1
00:21:03.324 --> 00:21:07.039
do a push operation so the
operation is T is equal to T +

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4222-2
00:21:07.039 --> 00:21:07.168
1.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4227-0
00:21:07.228 --> 00:21:07.998
All of you are right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4252-0
00:21:08.448 --> 00:21:12.090
I'll be going to this position
and I will put my new element,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4252-1
00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:14.088
say 100 that would malament
here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4260-0
00:21:14.528 --> 00:21:16.098
I want to again do a push
operation.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4264-0
00:21:16.908 --> 00:21:17.408
I'll go here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4287-0
00:21:18.448 --> 00:21:22.399
I'll put my item and T will be
pointing to this top most

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4287-1
00:21:22.399 --> 00:21:24.618
element which is 200 now, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4293-0
00:21:25.948 --> 00:21:26.708
Now I have a question.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4305-0
00:21:27.458 --> 00:21:30.148
Can you go ahead and randomly
remove these items?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4309-0
00:21:30.518 --> 00:21:31.108
Is it possible?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4317-0
00:21:33.128 --> 00:21:35.618
Yeah, not really.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4320-0
00:21:35.668 --> 00:21:36.038
Right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4351-0
00:21:36.688 --> 00:21:40.501
So now in this case, what is the
only item that I can delete now

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4351-1
00:21:40.501 --> 00:21:44.020
in this current state, which is
the only element that I can

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4351-2
00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:45.018
remove 200 right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4367-0
00:21:45.068 --> 00:21:48.154
Only 200 I can remove and then
what should I do

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4367-1
00:21:48.154 --> 00:21:49.248
programmatically?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4373-0
00:21:49.258 --> 00:21:49.768
How will you do that?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4381-0
00:21:50.538 --> 00:21:51.888
I will make this to be null.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4393-0
00:21:52.318 --> 00:21:56.128
I will do T is equal to P -, 1,
right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4410-0
00:21:56.258 --> 00:22:00.121
So now T will point here, then
heard hundred is the topmost

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4410-1
00:22:00.121 --> 00:22:00.508
right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4420-0
00:22:01.078 --> 00:22:03.188
If I want to delete him, I will
delete that hundred.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4434-0
00:22:03.698 --> 00:22:06.128
I'll again make T is equal to t
-, 1.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4439-0
00:22:06.538 --> 00:22:08.778
I can keep doing that, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4443-0
00:22:10.028 --> 00:22:10.318
Cool.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4458-0
00:22:10.328 --> 00:22:13.060
This is one example, but there
are also some other

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4458-1
00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:14.078
terminologies here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4474-0
00:22:14.568 --> 00:22:18.025
For example, if I insert another
item here, right, let's say I

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4474-1
00:22:18.025 --> 00:22:19.068
didn't delete them.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4486-0
00:22:19.078 --> 00:22:22.128
I've inserted here as well and
now TC pointing here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4496-0
00:22:23.228 --> 00:22:24.978
Now I want to insert another
item.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4504-0
00:22:25.248 --> 00:22:26.838
I'll do T equal to T + 1.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4510-0
00:22:27.148 --> 00:22:27.988
So what will happen here?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4517-0
00:22:29.258 --> 00:22:30.378
What will be the value of T?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4519-0
00:22:33.168 --> 00:22:33.328
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4551-0
00:22:35.278 --> 00:22:39.230
It it it went to N right it it
is actually out of bounds and

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4551-1
00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:43.118
that particular case in stacks
is called as Stack Overflow.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4553-0
00:22:43.968 --> 00:22:44.378
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4560-0
00:22:44.468 --> 00:22:45.298
I'm very fond name.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4585-0
00:22:45.308 --> 00:22:48.062
Most of you would have, you
know, Googled about your errors

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4585-1
00:22:48.062 --> 00:22:50.908
and there's a website called,
you know Stack Overflow and all

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4585-2
00:22:50.908 --> 00:22:51.138
that.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4588-0
00:22:51.148 --> 00:22:51.438
Right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4622-0
00:22:51.888 --> 00:22:55.792
So we have got inspired from
here that when the whole stack

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4622-1
00:22:55.792 --> 00:22:59.826
is filled and still if you are
trying to insert something you

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4622-2
00:22:59.826 --> 00:23:01.518
will not be able to do so.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4640-0
00:23:01.528 --> 00:23:04.976
You will go out of bounds and
that condition is called as

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4640-1
00:23:04.976 --> 00:23:05.868
Stack Overflow.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4656-0
00:23:06.278 --> 00:23:09.106
An example could be that, let's
say suppose there is a bucket

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4656-1
00:23:09.106 --> 00:23:09.928
filled with water.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4664-0
00:23:10.438 --> 00:23:12.178
You're still trying to pour
water, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4672-0
00:23:12.188 --> 00:23:12.888
You will not be able to.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4679-0
00:23:12.898 --> 00:23:13.828
The water will spill out.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4686-0
00:23:14.218 --> 00:23:15.948
That condition is called
overflow.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4699-0
00:23:17.158 --> 00:23:20.188
Similarly, in other thing can
happen, so I keep deleting them.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4714-0
00:23:20.198 --> 00:23:22.958
I delete every item here and I
have the last item.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4719-0
00:23:22.968 --> 00:23:24.068
I've deleted that also.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4738-0
00:23:24.398 --> 00:23:27.756
Now there are no elements here
and at that stage I am again

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4738-1
00:23:27.756 --> 00:23:28.988
trying to go do a pop.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4764-0
00:23:29.118 --> 00:23:33.029
I'm trying to remove something
right stack is empty, but you're

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4764-1
00:23:33.029 --> 00:23:37.001
still trying to remove something
that is called stack underflow,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4764-2
00:23:37.001 --> 00:23:37.368
right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4775-0
00:23:37.378 --> 00:23:39.268
And analogy would be that you
know this.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4783-0
00:23:39.308 --> 00:23:40.408
No water in the bucket.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4798-0
00:23:40.618 --> 00:23:43.254
You're still trying to, you
know, take a mug of water from

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4798-1
00:23:43.254 --> 00:23:43.388
it.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4802-0
00:23:43.778 --> 00:23:44.818
Not possible, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4810-0
00:23:45.018 --> 00:23:46.408
So that is stack underflow.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4821-0
00:23:48.588 --> 00:23:50.348
A couple of you know simple
algorithms for you.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4825-0
00:23:51.968 --> 00:23:53.118
Sites right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4829-0
00:23:53.128 --> 00:23:54.078
So what exactly?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4837-0
00:23:54.208 --> 00:23:55.598
Then how is it different from
array?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4846-0
00:23:55.608 --> 00:23:57.098
Because this too has the limit.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4859-0
00:23:57.108 --> 00:23:59.738
Yeah, it has the limit, but it
follows that paradigm, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4867-0
00:23:59.968 --> 00:24:01.998
You cannot randomly take an
element.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4878-0
00:24:02.008 --> 00:24:04.862
You cannot randomly insert
something or remove something,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4878-1
00:24:04.862 --> 00:24:05.158
right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4907-0
00:24:05.168 --> 00:24:08.885
It is always this top element
will give the topmost element

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4907-1
00:24:08.885 --> 00:24:12.478
and only in that direction you
can do either push or pop.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4915-0
00:24:12.988 --> 00:24:14.458
That is why this is a stack.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4918-0
00:24:15.798 --> 00:24:16.268
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4923-0
00:24:16.318 --> 00:24:17.158
Is that clear, Krishna?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4958-0
00:24:19.278 --> 00:24:23.268
We are using array to implement
this paradigm of stack right

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4958-1
00:24:23.268 --> 00:24:27.585
which is last come you know last
in first out our indices started

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4958-2
00:24:27.585 --> 00:24:29.548
0 so we initialize 2 -, 1 yes.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4975-0
00:24:29.678 --> 00:24:32.568
So because initially otherwise
our whole, you know logic will

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4975-1
00:24:32.568 --> 00:24:33.548
get different, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/4994-0
00:24:33.798 --> 00:24:38.008
So initially we will have it as
minus one, so it'll go to zero.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5000-0
00:24:38.018 --> 00:24:39.028
I'll put my item there.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5013-0
00:24:39.138 --> 00:24:42.778
I'll go to one, put my item
there and so on, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5022-0
00:24:43.318 --> 00:24:45.058
But can we access any element
from inventory?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5029-0
00:24:45.068 --> 00:24:45.928
No, we cannot do that.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5040-0
00:24:45.998 --> 00:24:48.528
Yeah, we have to always rely on
only the top.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5054-0
00:24:48.978 --> 00:24:51.488
Yeah, we cannot even, you know,
directly access in between.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5058-0
00:24:51.498 --> 00:24:51.948
And so on.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5068-0
00:24:52.438 --> 00:24:53.748
All that we have is the T.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5072-0
00:24:54.658 --> 00:24:55.088
That's all.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5087-0
00:24:55.128 --> 00:24:59.967
We don't have any other, you
know, pointers, indexes and so

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5087-1
00:24:59.967 --> 00:25:01.258
on, right? Cool.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5104-0
00:25:03.168 --> 00:25:05.174
How do you initialize the stack
in a code and how to

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5104-1
00:25:05.174 --> 00:25:05.818
differentiate it?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5108-0
00:25:05.828 --> 00:25:05.958
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5113-0
00:25:05.968 --> 00:25:06.818
We will come to all that.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5122-0
00:25:06.828 --> 00:25:08.048
Yeah, I will be uploading a
notebook.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5128-0
00:25:08.058 --> 00:25:09.738
Also, don't worry about that.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5149-0
00:25:09.888 --> 00:25:13.374
Yeah, we will initialize it like
a normal array with capital

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5149-1
00:25:13.374 --> 00:25:14.118
north, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5174-0
00:25:14.128 --> 00:25:17.353
We will give it a S10 size or 50
size and initially all of them

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5174-1
00:25:17.353 --> 00:25:19.218
will be just, you know, junk
values.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5192-0
00:25:21.258 --> 00:25:24.178
So now let's you know, look at
some small pseudo codes which is

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5192-1
00:25:24.178 --> 00:25:25.228
really important, yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5202-0
00:25:27.608 --> 00:25:28.878
First of all, what is the size?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5204-0
00:25:28.988 --> 00:25:29.188
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5214-0
00:25:30.128 --> 00:25:31.838
So there's a very subtle
difference, guys.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5221-0
00:25:31.908 --> 00:25:34.868
We have been talking about
capital N, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5226-0
00:25:34.878 --> 00:25:36.018
So what is capital N?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5234-0
00:25:39.338 --> 00:25:41.138
Capital N is not the size.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5236-0
00:25:42.298 --> 00:25:42.878
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5241-0
00:25:42.938 --> 00:25:43.358
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5253-0
00:25:43.418 --> 00:25:45.508
We'll look at these codes and
then it'll be all clear.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5255-0
00:25:45.518 --> 00:25:45.878
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5257-0
00:25:45.888 --> 00:25:46.218
So we.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5269-0
00:25:49.398 --> 00:25:51.488
Yeah, we were doing T equal to t
-.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5273-0
00:25:51.498 --> 00:25:52.068
One yeah, we did.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5284-0
00:25:52.078 --> 00:25:54.688
Not directly initialize it to be
equal to minus one.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5294-0
00:25:54.698 --> 00:25:55.948
We'll look at all this example.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5302-0
00:25:55.958 --> 00:25:56.718
It'll be even more clear.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5305-0
00:25:57.478 --> 00:25:57.988
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5317-0
00:25:58.038 --> 00:26:01.998
So this capital N is the total
capacity, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5339-0
00:26:02.948 --> 00:26:06.290
So whenever we are creating that
stack using an array, we are

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5339-1
00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:08.178
defining the total capacity
right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5352-0
00:26:08.188 --> 00:26:11.398
That is my capital N there is
no.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5376-0
00:26:11.518 --> 00:26:16.121
By size I mean how many elements
are there currently right in

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5376-1
00:26:16.121 --> 00:26:19.388
order to get that I will use
deep plus one.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5383-0
00:26:20.118 --> 00:26:22.178
So in this example, how many
elements are there?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5394-0
00:26:24.128 --> 00:26:27.248
You'll tell me the capacity is
how much?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5401-0
00:26:28.038 --> 00:26:29.308
What is capital N?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5413-0
00:26:29.678 --> 00:26:33.908
Capital N is 6 and how many
elements are currently occupied.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5418-0
00:26:33.918 --> 00:26:35.338
There are four elements
currently.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5426-0
00:26:35.688 --> 00:26:36.568
How do we get that four?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5431-0
00:26:37.318 --> 00:26:37.928
Where is T.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5443-0
00:26:37.938 --> 00:26:42.598
Currently, we will always point
to me top most element right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5447-0
00:26:42.608 --> 00:26:43.708
Where is it pointing currently?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5479-0
00:26:46.118 --> 00:26:49.932
He will point to the topmost
element, so T is pointing to

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5479-1
00:26:49.932 --> 00:26:54.141
this position three since RENI
start from zero, I should do a +

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5479-2
00:26:54.141 --> 00:26:54.668
1 right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5502-0
00:26:54.918 --> 00:26:58.927
So this T + 1 will always give
me how many elements are there

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5502-1
00:26:58.927 --> 00:27:00.738
inside this stack currently.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5515-0
00:27:02.048 --> 00:27:05.708
Is this core clear for all of
you the size algorithm?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5527-0
00:27:07.128 --> 00:27:10.098
Size means the number of
elements in the stack.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5544-0
00:27:10.108 --> 00:27:13.246
It is not the whole capacity
then anyway I can just return

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5544-1
00:27:13.246 --> 00:27:14.098
capital N right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5547-0
00:27:14.108 --> 00:27:14.678
That was wrong.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5563-0
00:27:15.188 --> 00:27:18.304
Size means how many elements are
currently there and how to get

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5563-1
00:27:18.304 --> 00:27:18.548
that.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5606-0
00:27:19.788 --> 00:27:23.830
I will get it using top whereas
top will be a little misleading

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5606-1
00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:27.872
because arrays start from zero,
so I should do A T + 1 and that

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5606-2
00:27:27.872 --> 00:27:31.409
will always give me how many
elements are there in this

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5606-3
00:27:31.409 --> 00:27:31.788
stack.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5608-0
00:27:33.168 --> 00:27:33.558
Cool.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5615-0
00:27:33.628 --> 00:27:34.648
What about the next algorithm?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5620-0
00:27:35.908 --> 00:27:36.958
Algorithm is empty.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5647-0
00:27:38.508 --> 00:27:42.130
This seudo code is going to give
me a true if that stack is

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5647-1
00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:45.028
empty, otherwise he's going to
give me a false.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5658-0
00:27:45.788 --> 00:27:48.958
So in this case, how do you know
that?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5673-0
00:27:49.228 --> 00:27:51.668
So whenever a stack is empty,
what will be the T value?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5702-0
00:27:52.768 --> 00:27:57.006
So do we they initial state or
when you have inserted and you

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5702-1
00:27:57.006 --> 00:28:01.107
have removed everything, what
will be the T value minus one

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5702-2
00:28:01.107 --> 00:28:01.518
right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5712-0
00:28:01.628 --> 00:28:03.398
So I can use that in my
condition.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5734-0
00:28:03.768 --> 00:28:07.882
I can say if value is minus one
then return it true true meaning

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5734-1
00:28:07.882 --> 00:28:08.958
is empty is true.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5738-0
00:28:08.968 --> 00:28:09.778
Yes, it is empty.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5748-0
00:28:10.228 --> 00:28:11.728
Otherwise, return it as false.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5757-0
00:28:12.648 --> 00:28:15.668
So in this particular example,
what is my T value?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5767-0
00:28:17.808 --> 00:28:18.698
I go to this line.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5773-0
00:28:18.708 --> 00:28:20.158
I see that my T value is.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5796-0
00:28:22.338 --> 00:28:27.221
Three right is not equal to
minus one, so I'll go ahead and

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5796-1
00:28:27.221 --> 00:28:28.768
return it as false.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5805-0
00:28:28.778 --> 00:28:29.968
Yeah, that was also correct.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5813-0
00:28:29.978 --> 00:28:32.228
In this case, my stack is having
elements.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5828-0
00:28:32.238 --> 00:28:34.578
It is not empty, so I'll give it
as false.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5833-0
00:28:35.768 --> 00:28:36.598
He's the second code.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5844-0
00:28:36.608 --> 00:28:39.318
Also clear for all of you is
empty.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5860-0
00:28:39.328 --> 00:28:42.378
Is always going to return true
if the whole stack is empty.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5886-0
00:28:43.248 --> 00:28:48.512
What about this example in this
example, if I run my is empty,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5886-1
00:28:48.512 --> 00:28:50.518
will give true or false.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5893-0
00:28:52.198 --> 00:28:53.928
My K value is currently minus
one.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5899-0
00:28:54.018 --> 00:28:55.388
Nobody is there inside this.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5925-0
00:28:55.738 --> 00:28:59.018
So you will give it true and if
I run the size algorithm on it,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5925-1
00:28:59.018 --> 00:29:01.478
what will the size algorithm
give me as answer?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5947-0
00:29:04.008 --> 00:29:09.018
Size algorithm says T + 1 T is
minus one, so minus 1 + 1 is 0.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5958-0
00:29:09.368 --> 00:29:11.598
So it will give me a zero and
which is correct.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5966-0
00:29:11.608 --> 00:29:14.748
I have zero elements inside this
perfect.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5973-0
00:29:15.968 --> 00:29:18.908
What about top right top mining?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/5985-0
00:29:19.158 --> 00:29:22.628
I'm asking who is the topmost
element right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6015-0
00:29:22.638 --> 00:29:26.181
I'm not asking the index of it,
I'm asking who is present in

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6015-1
00:29:26.181 --> 00:29:29.608
that location, who's the top
most element, the one who got

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6015-2
00:29:29.608 --> 00:29:30.828
inserted last, right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6018-0
00:29:30.838 --> 00:29:31.308
Who's that?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6032-0
00:29:31.618 --> 00:29:34.998
I'm going to ask him how do I
get that right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6039-0
00:29:36.308 --> 00:29:37.508
Please repeat just the last one.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6045-0
00:29:37.518 --> 00:29:38.458
Which one should be?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6078-0
00:29:38.468 --> 00:29:43.313
You mean the EMT one or the last
example was is MD so in this

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6078-1
00:29:43.313 --> 00:29:47.378
case it is minus one, so it will
return it as true.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6112-0
00:29:47.468 --> 00:29:51.328
It'll return it as true and in
this same example I asked in

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6112-1
00:29:51.328 --> 00:29:55.188
this case if I invoke the size
algorithm, what will happen?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6118-0
00:29:55.658 --> 00:29:57.328
So size algorithm told T + 1.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6166-0
00:29:58.078 --> 00:30:02.155
What is the value in my case it
is minus one here, so I'll do

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6166-1
00:30:02.155 --> 00:30:06.101
minus one and this plus one is
there minus 1 + 1 is 0 so it

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6166-2
00:30:06.101 --> 00:30:10.048
will return that zero is its
size and is that correct here?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6176-0
00:30:10.118 --> 00:30:11.078
Yes, it is the size.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6190-0
00:30:11.088 --> 00:30:14.445
There is no element at all
inside all of the slots are

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6190-1
00:30:14.445 --> 00:30:15.178
free, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6197-0
00:30:15.228 --> 00:30:16.148
So that is what it is.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6199-0
00:30:17.108 --> 00:30:17.558
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6214-0
00:30:17.708 --> 00:30:20.418
Can you explain T equal to minus
one so that is initialization?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6216-0
00:30:20.428 --> 00:30:20.798
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6235-0
00:30:20.808 --> 00:30:24.765
So at the very beginning, when
the stack is empty, we as in T

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6235-1
00:30:24.765 --> 00:30:25.978
value as minus one.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6251-0
00:30:27.418 --> 00:30:30.368
Yeah, that condition itself can
also be used to recognize that

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6251-1
00:30:30.368 --> 00:30:31.258
the stack is empty.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6272-0
00:30:33.268 --> 00:30:36.764
How to get the capacity of the
stack that you always have it in

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6272-1
00:30:36.764 --> 00:30:37.638
capital N right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6314-0
00:30:37.648 --> 00:30:41.282
Because you are only creating
the stack using this capital N

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6314-1
00:30:41.282 --> 00:30:44.975
so at any time in the program,
if you just print your capital

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6314-2
00:30:44.975 --> 00:30:48.371
N, you are going to get the
capacity and that is in your

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6314-3
00:30:48.371 --> 00:30:48.848
control.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6324-0
00:30:48.938 --> 00:30:51.938
You are only going to choose the
capacity of it, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6326-0
00:30:53.288 --> 00:30:53.778
Cool.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6334-0
00:30:54.148 --> 00:30:55.888
What about the next algorithm
which is top?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6370-0
00:30:57.808 --> 00:31:01.151
These empty so again here also
there is a you know trick here

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6370-1
00:31:01.151 --> 00:31:04.549
right that is you want to know
the topmost element but what if

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6370-2
00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:05.628
there is no element?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6378-0
00:31:06.898 --> 00:31:07.858
There's a problem, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6406-0
00:31:08.738 --> 00:31:11.796
I want you to give me the
topmost element, but in the

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6406-1
00:31:11.796 --> 00:31:14.968
current stage, if there are no
elements then there is a

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6406-2
00:31:14.968 --> 00:31:15.818
problem, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6447-0
00:31:17.218 --> 00:31:20.386
So here we are, first checking
if it's empty is true, then just

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6447-1
00:31:20.386 --> 00:31:23.258
throw an error telling that no,
I cannot give you the top

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6447-2
00:31:23.258 --> 00:31:25.338
element because the whole stack
is empty.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6458-0
00:31:26.268 --> 00:31:30.498
Otherwise I will go to a soft
stack of tea.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6470-0
00:31:30.788 --> 00:31:33.738
I'll pick up the topmost element
right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6477-0
00:31:33.748 --> 00:31:35.078
So in this example, who is T?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6506-0
00:31:35.798 --> 00:31:40.767
He is pointing to three, so as
soft is nothing but a soft three

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6506-1
00:31:40.767 --> 00:31:43.408
and S of three is nothing but
41.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6511-0
00:31:44.098 --> 00:31:45.438
That is my top most element.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6513-0
00:31:48.188 --> 00:31:48.338
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6516-0
00:31:52.668 --> 00:31:52.948
Yes.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6520-0
00:31:52.958 --> 00:31:53.198
No.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6524-0
00:31:53.208 --> 00:31:54.388
Maybe all of you.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6528-0
00:31:55.158 --> 00:31:55.908
We'll come there, guys.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6535-0
00:31:55.918 --> 00:31:57.368
Yeah. Don't jump the bridge,
ANIKET.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6539-0
00:31:57.378 --> 00:31:57.828
All of you?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6547-0
00:31:57.838 --> 00:31:58.998
Yeah, we'll come there.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6553-0
00:31:59.948 --> 00:32:01.958
So far are these three
algorithms clear?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6564-0
00:32:02.028 --> 00:32:05.498
Yeah, size of it is T + 1 is
empty.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6597-0
00:32:05.508 --> 00:32:09.235
You can always check using your
T if it is minus one topmost

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6597-1
00:32:09.235 --> 00:32:12.901
element, you'll always get it by
soft, but there is a trick

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6597-2
00:32:12.901 --> 00:32:13.268
there.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6609-0
00:32:13.378 --> 00:32:16.386
That is, if there are no
elements, how will you give the

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6609-1
00:32:16.386 --> 00:32:17.178
top most right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6629-0
00:32:17.188 --> 00:32:20.908
So I'll put an error there error
check if that is not the case.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6645-0
00:32:20.918 --> 00:32:24.414
If there are any elements, then
I'll pick up that topmost

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6645-1
00:32:24.414 --> 00:32:25.258
element. Well.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6657-0
00:32:26.468 --> 00:32:27.978
Now let's go to the push
algorithm.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6667-0
00:32:28.448 --> 00:32:30.148
Push and pop are the heart of
the stack.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6687-0
00:32:32.398 --> 00:32:36.231
You clearly observed here in the
push word in the bracket you

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6687-1
00:32:36.231 --> 00:32:38.148
also see something here, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6690-0
00:32:38.158 --> 00:32:38.538
What is that?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6694-0
00:32:42.738 --> 00:32:43.518
Yeah, real quick.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6703-0
00:32:47.898 --> 00:32:49.068
Item to be inserted right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6724-0
00:32:49.078 --> 00:32:51.952
So there is an argument there,
so that is the argument or

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6724-1
00:32:51.952 --> 00:32:53.638
element that I want to push
that.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6732-0
00:32:53.688 --> 00:32:54.908
Oh, right, it can be anything.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6752-0
00:32:54.918 --> 00:33:00.088
You can your name or whatever it
is that argument which I want to

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6752-1
00:33:00.088 --> 00:33:01.028
insert here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6759-0
00:33:01.038 --> 00:33:02.608
Also, I should do a check
correct?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6765-0
00:33:02.658 --> 00:33:03.828
We already spoke about it.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6773-0
00:33:04.338 --> 00:33:05.568
You've already the bucket is
full.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6781-0
00:33:05.578 --> 00:33:06.828
How can you fill right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6803-0
00:33:07.138 --> 00:33:10.770
So I will check if this size is
equal to N size algorithm you

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6803-1
00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:11.708
already learned.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6820-0
00:33:12.698 --> 00:33:18.030
That is, if my size becomes
capacity correct then I will not

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6820-1
00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:20.128
be able to insert right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6856-0
00:33:20.218 --> 00:33:24.613
So I will throw an error telling
Stack overflow other ways as you

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6856-1
00:33:24.613 --> 00:33:29.008
are already replied, I will do T
equal to T + 1 in that location.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6864-0
00:33:29.018 --> 00:33:31.008
I will put my object, so let's
do that.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6871-0
00:33:31.018 --> 00:33:32.288
Let's do that in this example.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6881-0
00:33:32.298 --> 00:33:34.118
Yeah, all of you just focus for
a minute.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6891-0
00:33:34.298 --> 00:33:35.838
Then we will take up all these
questions.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6893-0
00:33:35.848 --> 00:33:36.348
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6901-0
00:33:36.548 --> 00:33:37.888
So in this case, what is size?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6904-0
00:33:41.998 --> 00:33:42.268
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6915-0
00:33:42.278 --> 00:33:44.368
No, this is this is just a
placeholder, MANISHA.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6926-0
00:33:44.378 --> 00:33:46.548
Yeah, this O is a name of it.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6933-0
00:33:46.618 --> 00:33:48.988
Inside that there is a number.
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6956-0
00:33:48.998 --> 00:33:51.995
So you can have MANISHA here
that MANISHA is the variable

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6956-1
00:33:51.995 --> 00:33:54.218
name and inside that I'm having
the value.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6958-0
00:33:54.438 --> 00:33:55.708
OK, cool.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6985-0
00:33:55.718 --> 00:34:00.630
So in this case my K value is 4,
his four equal to make capacity

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/6985-1
00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:01.008
6 no.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7001-0
00:34:01.298 --> 00:34:04.368
So I'll be able to insert so I
do T equal to T + 1.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7013-0
00:34:04.438 --> 00:34:07.808
I come to this position and I
put my object there.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7023-0
00:34:07.818 --> 00:34:10.558
I want to insert 50 now I insert
50 here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7032-0
00:34:11.788 --> 00:34:13.748
Well, I want to insert one more.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7037-0
00:34:14.038 --> 00:34:15.288
What do we do now?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7047-0
00:34:15.298 --> 00:34:18.138
My what is my size now in this
case?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7060-0
00:34:20.688 --> 00:34:22.778
I have already inserted, you
know, a couple of elements.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7071-0
00:34:22.788 --> 00:34:25.498
My size is 5 so this line what
will we do?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7083-0
00:34:25.668 --> 00:34:28.178
We will check if five is equal
to six. No.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7103-0
00:34:29.158 --> 00:34:31.528
So I will do T equal to T + 1.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7108-0
00:34:31.538 --> 00:34:35.238
That is from four to five in
that position.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7113-0
00:34:35.298 --> 00:34:37.148
Let S of five position.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7131-0
00:34:37.598 --> 00:34:41.097
I'll go and put my new element,
let's say this O in my example

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7131-1
00:34:41.097 --> 00:34:41.708
now is 100.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7138-0
00:34:42.218 --> 00:34:43.178
I'll put that 100 here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7143-0
00:34:44.218 --> 00:34:44.668
I think so.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7166-0
00:34:44.848 --> 00:34:49.274
Now also I want to again insert
right now again I go to this

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7166-1
00:34:49.274 --> 00:34:50.798
line what is my size?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7175-0
00:34:54.648 --> 00:34:55.698
Yeah, yeah, I mean I that's
right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7183-0
00:34:55.708 --> 00:34:56.978
Yeah, you can also use this,
correct?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7186-0
00:34:58.008 --> 00:34:58.398
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7206-0
00:34:58.408 --> 00:35:03.050
Now in this case my size value
has already become six, so six

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7206-1
00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:04.248
is equal to six.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7210-0
00:35:04.258 --> 00:35:05.778
Is true, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7215-0
00:35:05.828 --> 00:35:06.958
This line is now true.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7225-0
00:35:07.308 --> 00:35:09.458
So now I cannot insert anything
else right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7244-0
00:35:09.468 --> 00:35:12.529
I'm already Phil, so I will
throw this error telling the

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7244-1
00:35:12.529 --> 00:35:13.658
stack is overflowing.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7252-0
00:35:13.668 --> 00:35:15.268
I cannot insert this new
element.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7263-0
00:35:16.118 --> 00:35:18.968
Cool, and Vinay had a very
important doubt, he told.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7283-0
00:35:19.058 --> 00:35:21.602
You spoke about all that pseudo
code and all that, but why are

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7283-1
00:35:21.602 --> 00:35:22.168
you violating?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7286-0
00:35:22.298 --> 00:35:22.668
Right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7298-0
00:35:22.938 --> 00:35:26.054
So this SOFT line should have
been actually like this,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7298-1
00:35:26.054 --> 00:35:26.508
correct?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7319-0
00:35:27.678 --> 00:35:30.472
As Aiment in pseudocode is
technically like this symbol,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7319-1
00:35:30.472 --> 00:35:32.188
this is how you have to do,
right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7331-0
00:35:32.198 --> 00:35:33.488
But we have used the equal to
here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7357-0
00:35:33.938 --> 00:35:37.309
So he's like, you know, but it
is still agreed upon, right, as

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7357-1
00:35:37.309 --> 00:35:40.039
long as you're able to
understand it is, you know,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7357-2
00:35:40.039 --> 00:35:40.628
still fine.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7369-0
00:35:41.408 --> 00:35:44.308
Yeah, but technically this is
what is correct.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7379-0
00:35:44.318 --> 00:35:46.168
I would urge you to do it like
this way, yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7394-0
00:35:48.028 --> 00:35:50.518
All the push algorithm is it
clear for all of you.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7397-0
00:35:52.538 --> 00:35:52.868
Yes.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7399-0
00:35:52.878 --> 00:35:53.248
No, maybe.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7427-0
00:35:56.288 --> 00:35:59.317
Correct in here also I have used
this notation only right equally

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7427-1
00:35:59.317 --> 00:36:01.658
equal to I have not used the
single equal to cool.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7445-0
00:36:02.128 --> 00:36:04.307
I mean both these examples I
have used a notation like a

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7445-1
00:36:04.307 --> 00:36:05.378
programming language itself.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7447-0
00:36:06.878 --> 00:36:07.058
Cool.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7452-0
00:36:07.078 --> 00:36:08.338
What about pop algorithm?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7459-0
00:36:08.718 --> 00:36:10.178
Yeah, very cool algorithm.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7473-0
00:36:10.188 --> 00:36:13.810
Again for Pop, I have not given
which element to you know

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7473-1
00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:14.248
delete.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7476-0
00:36:14.258 --> 00:36:14.638
Why is that?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7479-0
00:36:21.978 --> 00:36:22.138
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7483-0
00:36:24.398 --> 00:36:24.808
Very good.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7493-0
00:36:24.818 --> 00:36:27.288
Yeah, always the last meaning
the last element.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7498-0
00:36:27.298 --> 00:36:28.188
Who was inserted?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7500-0
00:36:28.258 --> 00:36:28.568
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7519-0
00:36:28.578 --> 00:36:31.622
So it is very evident I should
not tell you what to delete in a

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7519-1
00:36:31.622 --> 00:36:31.908
stack.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7553-0
00:36:31.918 --> 00:36:35.651
It's already known that whoever
is in the top element, who he'll

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7553-1
00:36:35.651 --> 00:36:39.327
be the one who will get deleted,
so I need not mention anything

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7553-2
00:36:39.327 --> 00:36:41.108
which again there is a problem.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7562-0
00:36:41.218 --> 00:36:43.038
What if that whole stack itself
is empty?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7573-0
00:36:43.998 --> 00:36:45.768
How can I check that it's empty
right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7586-0
00:36:45.778 --> 00:36:48.218
This method that we learned I'll
put if it's empty.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7589-0
00:36:48.228 --> 00:36:48.498
It's true.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7599-0
00:36:49.328 --> 00:36:51.278
Then throw an error that stack
is underflow.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7610-0
00:36:51.348 --> 00:36:53.558
I cannot remove anything because
stack is already empty.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7618-0
00:36:53.848 --> 00:36:55.098
What do you want me to remove?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7620-0
00:36:55.678 --> 00:36:55.908
Right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7627-0
00:36:55.918 --> 00:36:56.558
I'll throw that error.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7657-0
00:36:57.828 --> 00:37:01.351
Otherwise, what I want to do is
I want to remove that element

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7657-1
00:37:01.351 --> 00:37:04.648
who's in the top and where is
that element as of T right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7673-0
00:37:04.658 --> 00:37:08.648
In this case this is my SP which
is 41.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7687-0
00:37:09.058 --> 00:37:12.508
So I'm actually just taking and
keeping it in another variable.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7711-0
00:37:12.618 --> 00:37:17.045
Is equal to South of three that
is equal to 41 and then that

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7711-1
00:37:17.045 --> 00:37:19.658
position S of T and making it
null.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7733-0
00:37:19.668 --> 00:37:24.089
Meaning here instead of 41 I'm
making it null and then I'm

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7733-1
00:37:24.089 --> 00:37:25.738
doing equal to t -, 1.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7765-0
00:37:25.748 --> 00:37:29.799
So my top value from 3 is now
slowly going to two and finally

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7765-1
00:37:29.799 --> 00:37:33.655
I'm returning that evalue 41
telling he is the guy who got

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7765-2
00:37:33.655 --> 00:37:34.178
deleted.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7776-0
00:37:35.198 --> 00:37:37.942
But actually speaking all this
is just a good programming

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7776-1
00:37:37.942 --> 00:37:38.368
practice.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7814-0
00:37:39.808 --> 00:37:44.838
Just this line is also good
enough as long as you, you know,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7814-1
00:37:44.838 --> 00:37:49.950
decrement your top value here
that 41 will be there, but when

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7814-2
00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:54.568
you push some other item it will
get overwritten right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7823-0
00:37:54.738 --> 00:37:55.628
But don't do all that.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7831-0
00:37:55.638 --> 00:37:57.588
It is all a bad programming
practice.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7868-0
00:37:58.138 --> 00:38:00.946
We just want to, you know, keep
it in a variable and then we can

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7868-1
00:38:00.946 --> 00:38:03.322
just print telling that, you
know, he's the 41 who got

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7868-2
00:38:03.322 --> 00:38:03.668
deleted.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7890-0
00:38:03.758 --> 00:38:06.556
Thing like that, technically,
but you don't need all that

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7890-1
00:38:06.556 --> 00:38:08.968
statements if you want to have a
very small code.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7894-0
00:38:09.198 --> 00:38:10.388
You don't need this line.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7901-0
00:38:10.438 --> 00:38:11.728
You don't need the last line.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7913-0
00:38:12.158 --> 00:38:14.138
Yeah, only these two are also
good enough.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7957-0
00:38:14.408 --> 00:38:17.385
And as I told, this null line is
also not needed the next time

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7957-1
00:38:17.385 --> 00:38:20.457
when you post something it will
get overwritten, but it's a good

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7957-2
00:38:20.457 --> 00:38:23.150
practice that whenever you
delete something, put it as a

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7957-3
00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:23.718
null, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7964-0
00:38:25.318 --> 00:38:26.538
He's a clear guys for all of
you.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7968-0
00:38:28.608 --> 00:38:28.838
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7982-0
00:38:28.848 --> 00:38:30.639
Where do we making it null
because we are deleting it

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/7982-1
00:38:30.639 --> 00:38:30.838
right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8000-0
00:38:30.848 --> 00:38:34.276
It's a good practice that when
you remove something you make

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8000-1
00:38:34.276 --> 00:38:35.738
that value as null, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8014-0
00:38:36.048 --> 00:38:37.998
But even if you don't do so,
it's fine.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8034-0
00:38:38.008 --> 00:38:40.895
As I told when you again insert
something that 41 would have got

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8034-1
00:38:40.895 --> 00:38:41.428
overwritten.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8056-0
00:38:43.208 --> 00:38:45.809
So I need to get the current
value of T we should have read

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8056-1
00:38:45.809 --> 00:38:48.498
the whole of stack initially for
all these algorithms, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8058-0
00:38:48.508 --> 00:38:48.778
Correct.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8069-0
00:38:48.788 --> 00:38:50.698
Yeah, you can't directly go take
something.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8077-0
00:38:51.288 --> 00:38:52.618
T will be your writer.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8116-0
00:38:53.028 --> 00:38:57.745
Whatever you want to do, you
have to do only using T either T

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8116-1
00:38:57.745 --> 00:39:02.005
equal to T + 1 including the
push and T equal to t -, 1

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8116-2
00:39:02.005 --> 00:39:04.288
during the pop, right yes, no.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8139-0
00:39:04.298 --> 00:39:08.520
If you understood stack and
their operations, so today I'll

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8139-1
00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:12.813
be uploading a Python notebook
which has Python code for all

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8139-2
00:39:12.813 --> 00:39:13.658
this, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8158-0
00:39:13.668 --> 00:39:15.813
So then you will just, you know,
run them and see, you know what

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8158-1
00:39:15.813 --> 00:39:16.408
happens and so on.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8164-0
00:39:18.308 --> 00:39:19.338
Yeah, Null gets assigned.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8182-0
00:39:19.348 --> 00:39:22.882
Yeah, there's nothing much that
is your cost course right in

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8182-1
00:39:22.882 --> 00:39:23.578
your memory.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8203-0
00:39:23.588 --> 00:39:26.075
Also, you'll be able to, you
know, so it's more like a wipe

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8203-1
00:39:26.075 --> 00:39:27.568
off of that, you know, memory
cell.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8211-0
00:39:30.308 --> 00:39:31.538
It's no all of you, yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8222-0
00:39:34.248 --> 00:39:35.758
What have we insert our element?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8232-0
00:39:35.768 --> 00:39:37.898
Uh, but we forget to delete a T
value.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8234-0
00:39:37.908 --> 00:39:38.078
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8241-0
00:39:38.088 --> 00:39:39.038
Then you are messing it up.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8245-0
00:39:39.048 --> 00:39:39.508
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8263-0
00:39:39.788 --> 00:39:43.821
So technically, if you see here,
firstly you should increment

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8263-1
00:39:43.821 --> 00:39:45.838
then only you can insert right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8288-0
00:39:45.848 --> 00:39:48.968
You cannot just insert first,
first clear off to agreement,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8288-1
00:39:48.968 --> 00:39:51.984
then you will go to the empty
space, then add the element

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8288-2
00:39:51.984 --> 00:39:52.608
here, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8294-0
00:39:54.208 --> 00:39:54.578
So.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8302-0
00:39:54.658 --> 00:39:56.238
So those are in order you.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8308-0
00:39:56.248 --> 00:39:57.218
You cannot forget it.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8311-0
00:39:57.228 --> 00:39:57.578
And so on.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8326-0
00:39:57.588 --> 00:40:00.295
Yeah, if you forget it, it's
simply means you are making a

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8326-1
00:40:00.295 --> 00:40:00.938
mistake there.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8337-0
00:40:00.988 --> 00:40:04.188
Yeah, but it is just
implementation in array.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8344-0
00:40:04.198 --> 00:40:05.748
We can take data from anywhere,
correct?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8354-0
00:40:05.918 --> 00:40:07.068
But in a stack you should not.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8356-0
00:40:07.078 --> 00:40:07.378
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8375-0
00:40:07.388 --> 00:40:10.679
So no, forget that you know you
are using an array it it is a

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8375-1
00:40:10.679 --> 00:40:10.998
stack.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8382-0
00:40:11.008 --> 00:40:13.258
You believe that it is a stack,
right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8407-0
00:40:14.328 --> 00:40:16.820
You should not directly go ahead
and you know, use this as of two

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8407-1
00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:18.558
and you know, take that element
and all that.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8450-0
00:40:19.128 --> 00:40:22.529
Correct, because the underlying
is the array, but now you are

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8450-1
00:40:22.529 --> 00:40:25.382
convinced that you are
implementing a stack, so you

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8450-2
00:40:25.382 --> 00:40:28.838
should not just go and you know
take some values from there in

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8450-3
00:40:28.838 --> 00:40:30.868
the 5th algorithm, just as laid
out.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8461-0
00:40:30.878 --> 00:40:33.288
Can we use another algorithm
within an algorithm?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8469-0
00:40:33.648 --> 00:40:34.748
What do you mean by that, Vinay?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8474-0
00:40:35.588 --> 00:40:36.268
This one, you mean?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8478-0
00:40:36.278 --> 00:40:36.978
Yeah, of course.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8489-0
00:40:36.988 --> 00:40:40.748
Yeah, here also I'm using size
right here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8498-0
00:40:40.758 --> 00:40:42.998
Also, I'm using the same T here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8510-0
00:40:43.008 --> 00:40:45.148
Also, I'm using SMT which is
another algorithm.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8519-0
00:40:45.408 --> 00:40:47.078
Yeah, of course I want to do
that.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8542-0
00:40:47.468 --> 00:40:50.229
Otherwise I have to write that
code again here that whole piece

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8542-1
00:40:50.229 --> 00:40:51.438
of code I should write here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8548-0
00:40:51.628 --> 00:40:53.108
Instead of that, I'm calling
that function.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8559-0
00:40:55.748 --> 00:40:57.098
Yeah, you cannot update and so
on.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8592-0
00:40:57.108 --> 00:41:00.284
You have to either add or insert
if you want to update, you have

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8592-1
00:41:00.284 --> 00:41:03.314
to go till there and you know
you have to add the new element

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8592-2
00:41:03.314 --> 00:41:03.608
there.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8596-0
00:41:04.358 --> 00:41:04.938
That's it, yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8610-0
00:41:08.138 --> 00:41:09.398
You know you cannot answer on
and.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8636-0
00:41:09.408 --> 00:41:11.717
Yeah, yeah, that is what I'm
again and again reiterating,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8636-1
00:41:11.717 --> 00:41:13.628
forget that it is an array, it
is not an array.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8658-0
00:41:14.368 --> 00:41:18.262
You are using an array to
implement stack, meaning you can

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8658-1
00:41:18.262 --> 00:41:20.638
only do these operations Bush,
pop.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8677-0
00:41:20.708 --> 00:41:24.121
You can get the top most you can
know if it is, you know empty or

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8677-1
00:41:24.121 --> 00:41:24.328
not.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8689-0
00:41:24.588 --> 00:41:26.678
You can know you know what is
the size of it.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8715-0
00:41:27.008 --> 00:41:30.826
Or of course, you can also know
if it is full or not by checking

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8715-1
00:41:30.826 --> 00:41:32.648
a in all ties with the capital.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8724-0
00:41:33.288 --> 00:41:34.838
You cannot go in between or.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8734-0
00:41:34.848 --> 00:41:36.918
You cannot take these elements
and you know all that.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8738-0
00:41:36.928 --> 00:41:38.888
We cannot do right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8745-0
00:41:41.278 --> 00:41:41.668
It's no.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8753-0
00:41:41.678 --> 00:41:42.908
Is it clear for all of you?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8756-0
00:41:43.418 --> 00:41:44.358
We'll take some examples.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8760-0
00:41:46.448 --> 00:41:46.918
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8797-0
00:41:46.968 --> 00:41:50.547
How to check where is my current
value that is a variable right

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8797-1
00:41:50.547 --> 00:41:54.239
in your program you will be able
to get it whenever you print it,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8797-2
00:41:54.239 --> 00:41:55.638
you will get the T value.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8803-0
00:41:56.578 --> 00:41:58.128
These just, you know variable
right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8812-0
00:42:00.208 --> 00:42:02.078
Consider an array based
implementation of stack.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8827-0
00:42:02.088 --> 00:42:04.628
Yes, assume that the maximum
size of the stack is is 3.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8835-0
00:42:04.638 --> 00:42:05.568
So what is this three now?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8847-0
00:42:07.168 --> 00:42:09.648
The one who gets this right gets
a goodie.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8856-0
00:42:11.148 --> 00:42:12.658
What is this 3 value denoting?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8861-0
00:42:12.728 --> 00:42:13.388
Yeah, very good.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8872-0
00:42:13.398 --> 00:42:15.508
This is a capital N it is not
the size.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8884-0
00:42:16.438 --> 00:42:20.128
Yeah, this is capital N someone
got it wrong, JAGDISH.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8891-0
00:42:20.218 --> 00:42:22.918
No, it is capital yen. Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8921-0
00:42:23.288 --> 00:42:26.140
So the contents of this track at
each step for the following

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8921-1
00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:29.040
sequence of operations mentioned
the exceptions like empty or

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8921-2
00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:29.648
full, if any.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8930-0
00:42:30.538 --> 00:42:32.198
So there are some operations
given to us.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8939-0
00:42:32.538 --> 00:42:34.188
So firstly I have my stack like
this.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8952-0
00:42:34.198 --> 00:42:37.058
It has three slots because my
capital N is 3.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8971-0
00:42:38.628 --> 00:42:43.177
Firstly, I'll have to do a push,
so currently the indexes are

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8971-1
00:42:43.177 --> 00:42:44.498
growing like this.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8977-0
00:42:45.508 --> 00:42:46.758
So where is my T value now?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8990-0
00:42:50.778 --> 00:42:51.748
So it'll be in others.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/8994-0
00:42:51.758 --> 00:42:52.588
Where is my K value.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9013-0
00:42:54.668 --> 00:42:58.608
Yeah, T value is always assigned
to minus one in the beginning,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9013-1
00:42:58.608 --> 00:42:58.978
right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9015-0
00:43:00.008 --> 00:43:01.868
Devalues minus one here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9030-0
00:43:03.938 --> 00:43:05.418
If they want to insert, what
should I do?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9048-0
00:43:06.588 --> 00:43:10.598
I should do T equal to T + 1 and
then insert it in that location.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9068-0
00:43:11.418 --> 00:43:15.523
So if I do A T + 1 in the this
place, what will happen from

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9068-1
00:43:15.523 --> 00:43:16.208
minus one?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9082-0
00:43:16.218 --> 00:43:19.388
I'll go to the zero to sell
right from minus one.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9109-0
00:43:19.398 --> 00:43:23.239
If I do plus one, it will become
zero, so I'll go to this cell in

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9109-1
00:43:23.239 --> 00:43:24.928
that I want to push this one.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9118-0
00:43:26.028 --> 00:43:28.718
I've pushed it and now what is
my top value?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9127-0
00:43:31.148 --> 00:43:33.268
Top value 0 right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9132-0
00:43:33.358 --> 00:43:34.228
This is 0.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9136-0
00:43:34.238 --> 00:43:35.298
This is 1 this is 2.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9156-0
00:43:37.158 --> 00:43:39.808
Again, I want to do a pop if I
do a pop, what would happen?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9168-0
00:43:39.818 --> 00:43:42.499
I will again remove this one and
what will be the top value

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9168-1
00:43:42.499 --> 00:43:42.768
again.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9180-0
00:43:44.878 --> 00:43:46.568
I inserted this one again.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9184-0
00:43:46.578 --> 00:43:47.308
I'm removing it.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9197-0
00:43:47.618 --> 00:43:49.288
If I remove it again, it will go
back to.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9210-0
00:43:49.698 --> 00:43:53.143
This one will get removed and
then my top value will become

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9210-1
00:43:53.143 --> 00:43:53.718
minus one.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9212-0
00:43:54.378 --> 00:43:54.658
Perfect.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9217-0
00:43:55.478 --> 00:43:56.428
What about next?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9229-0
00:43:56.498 --> 00:43:59.098
I want to push too, so two will
come here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9235-0
00:44:01.208 --> 00:44:01.478
Right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9245-0
00:44:01.488 --> 00:44:04.128
I have pushed it top value 0 now
right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9261-0
00:44:04.218 --> 00:44:10.288
I want to again push 3 have
pushed 3 right at this stage.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9267-0
00:44:10.458 --> 00:44:11.378
Where is the top value?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9270-0
00:44:12.838 --> 00:44:13.328
Very good.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9288-0
00:44:13.338 --> 00:44:16.518
Yeah, top is pointing here to
the top most element and the top

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9288-1
00:44:16.518 --> 00:44:17.578
most element is home.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9301-0
00:44:19.948 --> 00:44:25.678
Yeah, top most element top most
element is 3, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9317-0
00:44:25.688 --> 00:44:30.266
This is the topmost element and
he's given by the index one

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9317-1
00:44:30.266 --> 00:44:30.648
well.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9324-0
00:44:30.978 --> 00:44:32.408
Again, I have to do another
push.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9339-0
00:44:32.818 --> 00:44:36.868
I'm doing that also which you
stand and my top value is too.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9349-0
00:44:37.758 --> 00:44:39.478
What is the size of the stack
now?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9353-0
00:44:40.928 --> 00:44:42.298
Size, not capacity.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9362-0
00:44:42.448 --> 00:44:43.358
What is the size now?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9372-0
00:44:44.638 --> 00:44:47.528
Size is also three capacities
also three.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9379-0
00:44:48.018 --> 00:44:49.388
Now I'm planning to push five.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9387-0
00:44:49.398 --> 00:44:50.108
Will I be able to do that?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9403-0
00:44:51.368 --> 00:44:55.030
I cannot push 5 here because my
size is already equal to

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9403-1
00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:56.058
capacity, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9417-0
00:44:56.198 --> 00:45:00.572
So I'll throw an error telling
that my stack is full or stack

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9417-1
00:45:00.572 --> 00:45:01.208
overflow.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9425-0
00:45:01.968 --> 00:45:03.028
I will not be able to push it.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9433-0
00:45:04.288 --> 00:45:05.638
OK, what about pop?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9443-0
00:45:06.488 --> 00:45:09.738
After I remove this, what will
be the top value?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9445-0
00:45:11.858 --> 00:45:12.028
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9463-0
00:45:14.168 --> 00:45:17.498
Anyone after I remove this pop
it will become.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9468-0
00:45:20.918 --> 00:45:21.268
Right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9479-0
00:45:21.278 --> 00:45:22.948
I'm doing a pop forgot remote.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9481-0
00:45:22.958 --> 00:45:24.198
My top came here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9495-0
00:45:24.358 --> 00:45:26.548
I'm removing this three, then
top will come to two.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9499-0
00:45:27.328 --> 00:45:28.698
I'm ruining this also.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9509-0
00:45:28.788 --> 00:45:30.858
I'll go to zero at that stage.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9520-0
00:45:30.868 --> 00:45:33.738
If I do another pop I will get
stack control flow.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9533-0
00:45:33.828 --> 00:45:36.275
I will not be able to do
anything because this pop is

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9533-1
00:45:36.275 --> 00:45:36.638
telling.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9545-0
00:45:36.648 --> 00:45:40.268
Remove something, but already
there is nothing here, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9547-0
00:45:41.138 --> 00:45:41.408
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9556-0
00:45:41.418 --> 00:45:42.638
Is this clear guys for all of
you?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9558-0
00:45:44.008 --> 00:45:44.348
Yes.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9562-0
00:45:44.358 --> 00:45:44.618
No.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9579-0
00:45:44.628 --> 00:45:49.235
Maybe the whole operation of,
you know, inserting removal,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9579-1
00:45:49.235 --> 00:45:52.828
stack overflow, stack underflow,
all of this.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9582-0
00:45:54.888 --> 00:45:55.178
Yes.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9584-0
00:45:55.188 --> 00:45:55.268
No.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9594-0
00:45:56.898 --> 00:46:00.608
OK, So what are the
disadvantages of this? Right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9649-0
00:46:01.188 --> 00:46:03.667
The advantage is that if you are
using array based

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9649-1
00:46:03.667 --> 00:46:06.682
implementation, the first pop
should remove four rate correct

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9649-2
00:46:06.682 --> 00:46:09.696
first date removed four then it
removed three then it removed

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9649-3
00:46:09.696 --> 00:46:12.759
two then it was empty and that
empty stage you tried to remove

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9649-4
00:46:12.759 --> 00:46:14.218
the pop it which it could not.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9657-0
00:46:14.268 --> 00:46:15.198
It told that there is an error.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9669-0
00:46:16.588 --> 00:46:18.018
They are top is noted as the
correct.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9680-0
00:46:19.328 --> 00:46:20.788
You can have it as the whole
word top.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9682-0
00:46:20.798 --> 00:46:21.538
Also no problem.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9688-0
00:46:22.588 --> 00:46:23.698
Yeah, it removed it. Kevin.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9698-0
00:46:23.708 --> 00:46:25.698
Yeah, I'm not sure what's going
on.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9712-0
00:46:25.708 --> 00:46:27.818
There's a lot of, you know, lag
in the chat.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9716-0
00:46:28.188 --> 00:46:29.078
We removed four.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9722-0
00:46:29.088 --> 00:46:30.098
Then we removed three.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9728-0
00:46:30.108 --> 00:46:31.238
Then we removed two.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9730-0
00:46:31.328 --> 00:46:32.128
Then there was nothing.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9766-0
00:46:34.648 --> 00:46:37.693
No, no, no, I I just, you know,
showed the state and in this

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9766-1
00:46:37.693 --> 00:46:40.538
time applying pop so forgot
remote in this time applying

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9766-2
00:46:40.538 --> 00:46:41.138
again a pop.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9787-0
00:46:41.148 --> 00:46:44.308
So three got remote in this I
again applied a pop so two got

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9787-1
00:46:44.308 --> 00:46:45.708
remote something like that.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9790-0
00:46:47.278 --> 00:46:47.918
Yeah, yeah, correct.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9840-0
00:46:50.498 --> 00:46:54.043
So it is very simple and
efficient because all that you

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9840-1
00:46:54.043 --> 00:46:58.222
can do is just insert by using T
equal to T + 1 or remove using T

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9840-2
00:46:58.222 --> 00:47:02.338
equal to t, -, 1 and it is very
simple to do and it is constant.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9849-0
00:47:02.348 --> 00:47:04.968
You know, time complexity, it
has disadvantage.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9852-0
00:47:04.978 --> 00:47:05.888
We already spoke.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9868-0
00:47:06.228 --> 00:47:09.038
There's an upper bound capital N
on the size of the stack.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9891-0
00:47:09.968 --> 00:47:13.928
The arbitrary value N maybe too
small for a given application,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9891-1
00:47:13.928 --> 00:47:16.568
or it might be a wastage of
memory right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9899-0
00:47:16.808 --> 00:47:17.698
But now I have a question.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9913-0
00:47:18.578 --> 00:47:22.543
This disadvantage is it the
disadvantage of the stack

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9913-1
00:47:22.543 --> 00:47:23.058
itself?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9918-0
00:47:23.138 --> 00:47:24.478
Or is it because of the array?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9924-0
00:47:29.608 --> 00:47:29.888
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9951-0
00:47:29.898 --> 00:47:32.548
So in that will also be a stack
as long as you follow the

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9951-1
00:47:32.548 --> 00:47:34.468
paradigm last in first out it is
a stack.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9970-0
00:47:35.588 --> 00:47:38.896
Yeah, all of you are right, this
problem is not actually because

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9970-1
00:47:38.896 --> 00:47:39.558
of the stack.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9992-0
00:47:39.568 --> 00:47:42.437
It is because of the underlying
array, because array has a

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9992-1
00:47:42.437 --> 00:47:44.917
problem, it cannot grow
dynamically or you know it

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/9992-2
00:47:44.917 --> 00:47:45.598
cannot shrink.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10020-0
00:47:45.968 --> 00:47:49.808
So it is a problem of the array
which is then becoming a problem

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10020-1
00:47:49.808 --> 00:47:53.648
of stack also right because you
are using array to implement it.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10023-0
00:47:54.448 --> 00:47:54.638
Cool.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10033-0
00:47:55.718 --> 00:47:58.088
That is why we will use a better
approach using list.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10036-0
00:48:00.648 --> 00:48:00.818
No.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10046-0
00:48:00.828 --> 00:48:02.658
What are the applications of
this data structure?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10065-0
00:48:02.668 --> 00:48:06.179
Some of you might be like, you
know, all this top topmost is

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10065-1
00:48:06.179 --> 00:48:06.698
all fine.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10070-0
00:48:06.708 --> 00:48:08.458
Like you know, pushing, popping.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10080-0
00:48:08.868 --> 00:48:11.438
But why should I even learn
about stack, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10098-0
00:48:11.698 --> 00:48:15.453
Because it is very, very, you
know, important for our systems

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10098-1
00:48:15.453 --> 00:48:15.938
to work.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10105-0
00:48:16.058 --> 00:48:18.608
There are plenty of applications
of stack, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10120-0
00:48:18.618 --> 00:48:21.653
A couple of them have mentioned
here, stacks can be used for

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10120-1
00:48:21.653 --> 00:48:22.748
expression evaluation.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10124-0
00:48:23.278 --> 00:48:23.768
Yeah, I'll.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10143-0
00:48:23.778 --> 00:48:27.598
I'll talk about that now and
stacks can be used to convert

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10143-1
00:48:27.598 --> 00:48:30.188
from one form of expression to
another.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10148-0
00:48:30.268 --> 00:48:30.528
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10170-0
00:48:30.538 --> 00:48:33.788
In this PPT there is an appendix
I have given that in detail you

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10170-1
00:48:33.788 --> 00:48:34.988
can have a look at that.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10192-0
00:48:35.158 --> 00:48:38.966
I'll briefly also touch upon
that now stacks can be used to

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10192-1
00:48:38.966 --> 00:48:42.268
check parenthesis matching in an
expression, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10200-0
00:48:42.368 --> 00:48:42.968
Are you getting it?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10211-0
00:48:44.068 --> 00:48:46.898
These type of parenthesis we use
in our programs right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10251-0
00:48:47.758 --> 00:48:51.235
So I can I can actually use
stack in order to match this

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10251-1
00:48:51.235 --> 00:48:54.774
whenever there is an opening,
I'll push it onto the stack

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10251-2
00:48:54.774 --> 00:48:57.398
whenever there is a
corresponding bracket.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10274-0
00:48:57.408 --> 00:49:00.495
Whenever there is a closing
bracket, I'll pop something out

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10274-1
00:49:00.495 --> 00:49:03.378
right and I will match if there
is the same one or not.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10276-0
00:49:04.768 --> 00:49:05.128
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10288-0
00:49:05.138 --> 00:49:07.158
So I will leave it to you to
explore more about that.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10311-0
00:49:07.248 --> 00:49:10.650
Yeah, it's there in your book,
but this is the fundamental, you

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10311-1
00:49:10.650 --> 00:49:12.298
know, picture for example here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10334-0
00:49:12.308 --> 00:49:16.280
If I had this bracket, then when
I, you know encounter this, I'll

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10334-1
00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:18.868
pop something from the stack
from the pop.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10348-0
00:49:18.878 --> 00:49:21.528
I'll get this bracket, but what
I have in hand is this.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10354-0
00:49:21.618 --> 00:49:23.938
There is a mismatch, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10379-0
00:49:23.948 --> 00:49:27.579
So that is a problem, but it can
be used for, you know,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10379-1
00:49:27.579 --> 00:49:30.628
parenthesis matching and stack
data structure.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10389-0
00:49:30.638 --> 00:49:32.938
Are you also used in
backtracking problems like

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10389-1
00:49:32.938 --> 00:49:33.418
recursion?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10391-0
00:49:34.308 --> 00:49:34.518
Right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10393-0
00:49:35.658 --> 00:49:35.868
Cool.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10420-0
00:49:35.878 --> 00:49:38.598
So let's you know, get into the
expressions and so on, and then

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10420-1
00:49:38.598 --> 00:49:40.128
we will take it forward from
there.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10439-0
00:49:40.498 --> 00:49:43.384
If we want to delete the first
element when the size is yen,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10439-1
00:49:43.384 --> 00:49:44.568
then the case is correct.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10443-0
00:49:45.058 --> 00:49:45.548
That's right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10457-0
00:49:45.558 --> 00:49:49.645
You know Divya, but we are
always talking about one delete

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10457-1
00:49:49.645 --> 00:49:50.338
operation.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10466-0
00:49:50.528 --> 00:49:52.268
One delete operation is big O of
1.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10485-0
00:49:53.208 --> 00:49:56.546
If I want to do yen deletion
then that is of course we go of

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10485-1
00:49:56.546 --> 00:49:57.148
yen, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10500-0
00:49:57.868 --> 00:50:01.088
But always we are giving that
complexity of 1 operation not

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10500-1
00:50:01.088 --> 00:50:02.538
for the whole you know set.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10509-0
00:50:05.778 --> 00:50:06.568
Yeah, so far, so good.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10513-0
00:50:06.578 --> 00:50:07.138
All of you with me?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10515-0
00:50:09.118 --> 00:50:09.398
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10530-0
00:50:09.408 --> 00:50:11.670
Can we get started with
expressions and how stacks are

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10530-1
00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:12.328
being used here?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10539-0
00:50:13.538 --> 00:50:16.678
Yeah, real quick, just early
morning.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10546-0
00:50:16.738 --> 00:50:17.738
I don't see any responses.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10554-0
00:50:20.558 --> 00:50:22.308
Yeah, T is just the index,
ANIKET.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10561-0
00:50:22.318 --> 00:50:24.208
Yeah, not the top element
itself.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10572-0
00:50:24.318 --> 00:50:26.008
Yes, of T will give you the top
element.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10575-0
00:50:26.968 --> 00:50:27.698
These just the index.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10580-0
00:50:30.078 --> 00:50:30.308
Cool.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10587-0
00:50:30.318 --> 00:50:31.778
So let's see about these
expressions.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10606-0
00:50:31.788 --> 00:50:34.887
This is all your computer
organization course, but I just

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10606-1
00:50:34.887 --> 00:50:36.758
want to you know, that's about
it.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10624-0
00:50:36.768 --> 00:50:40.593
Maybe some of you might not know
this, so there are three types

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10624-1
00:50:40.593 --> 00:50:41.848
of expressions. Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10641-0
00:50:41.888 --> 00:50:45.694
So human beings, as human
beings, we use the infix

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10641-1
00:50:45.694 --> 00:50:46.888
notation, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10661-0
00:50:46.898 --> 00:50:50.337
Even in your math classes in
your childhood, you always use

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10661-1
00:50:50.337 --> 00:50:52.688
this notation where the operator
symbol.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10666-0
00:50:53.118 --> 00:50:53.948
What is an operator?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10672-0
00:50:53.958 --> 00:50:54.738
Can you give some examples?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10680-0
00:51:06.548 --> 00:51:06.918
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10691-0
00:51:06.988 --> 00:51:10.521
Your place minus and all those,
so that becomes your operator,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10691-1
00:51:10.521 --> 00:51:10.858
right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10698-0
00:51:11.108 --> 00:51:12.438
And what is your upper Rand?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10719-0
00:51:15.968 --> 00:51:19.512
Yeah, operand is nothing but a
BCD, or you know, you can have

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10719-1
00:51:19.512 --> 00:51:19.798
1000.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10732-0
00:51:19.808 --> 00:51:21.878
You are numbers and you are
variables.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10752-0
00:51:22.628 --> 00:51:26.863
So if you're pure operator in
between operand, then that is

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10752-1
00:51:26.863 --> 00:51:28.628
called as infix notation.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10794-0
00:51:29.848 --> 00:51:33.842
Yeah, that is how we we usually
use mathematical notations, and

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10794-1
00:51:33.842 --> 00:51:37.774
even in our programs, this is
how we use it. Whereas there are

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10794-2
00:51:37.774 --> 00:51:40.458
other two notations called
prefix and put.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10817-0
00:51:40.978 --> 00:51:45.737
Postfix prefix notation is also
called as Polish notation, and

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10817-1
00:51:45.737 --> 00:51:49.968
in this case the operator is
placed before the operand.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10850-0
00:51:50.218 --> 00:51:55.407
Something like this, less a, B
-, C, D into eight and so on,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10850-1
00:51:55.407 --> 00:52:00.682
where the operator comes first,
then the operand can post fix

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10850-2
00:52:00.682 --> 00:52:01.448
notation.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10855-0
00:52:01.958 --> 00:52:03.208
Is the exact opposite of it.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10875-0
00:52:03.698 --> 00:52:07.773
It is also called as reverse
Polish notation, where the

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10875-1
00:52:07.773 --> 00:52:11.048
operator symbol is placed after
its operand.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10898-0
00:52:11.358 --> 00:52:15.233
Thing like this right A/B plus
ad into and so one where the

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10898-1
00:52:15.233 --> 00:52:17.688
operator is coming after the
operand.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10901-0
00:52:18.858 --> 00:52:19.008
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10921-0
00:52:20.528 --> 00:52:23.535
Is this clear guys for all of
you and your computers, don't

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10921-1
00:52:23.535 --> 00:52:24.838
use infix notation at all.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10924-0
00:52:25.368 --> 00:52:25.958
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10931-0
00:52:26.228 --> 00:52:27.978
And I would also urge you why?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10937-0
00:52:28.028 --> 00:52:28.848
Yeah, go look.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10961-0
00:52:29.798 --> 00:52:32.740
You know, into your book or no
in the Internet on why are

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10961-1
00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:34.668
computers do not use in fix
notation.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/10977-0
00:52:34.958 --> 00:52:37.388
This is a very solid reasoning
why it doesn't use it.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11003-0
00:52:37.838 --> 00:52:42.439
Our computer will always use
only the post fix notation or

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11003-1
00:52:42.439 --> 00:52:46.962
prefix notation, and most modern
day hardware use postfix

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11003-2
00:52:46.962 --> 00:52:48.288
notations, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11008-0
00:52:48.438 --> 00:52:48.968
Is this clear?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11010-0
00:52:48.978 --> 00:52:49.498
Guys, all of you?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11013-0
00:52:52.498 --> 00:52:52.808
Yes.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11029-0
00:52:52.818 --> 00:52:55.628
No, maybe in fix is the one that
we are using.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11040-0
00:52:55.638 --> 00:52:58.258
If you put the symbol first then
it is prefix.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11063-0
00:52:58.458 --> 00:53:02.277
If you put the symbol after the
operand, it is postfix and our

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11063-1
00:53:02.277 --> 00:53:05.248
computer will always use only
postfix or prefix.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11071-0
00:53:05.738 --> 00:53:07.908
But as human beings, that is
difficult for us.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11096-0
00:53:07.958 --> 00:53:13.062
We always use infix, so now how
do I convert an infix notation

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11096-1
00:53:13.062 --> 00:53:15.088
into a post fix notation?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11100-0
00:53:16.228 --> 00:53:18.478
You can use stack right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11116-0
00:53:18.488 --> 00:53:21.138
That is what I have given as an
appendix in this deck.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11136-0
00:53:21.228 --> 00:53:26.799
If I have an expression like
this A+B into C and if I want to

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11136-1
00:53:26.799 --> 00:53:27.968
convert this.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11147-0
00:53:28.038 --> 00:53:31.608
If I want to convert this into
other notation right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11169-0
00:53:31.618 --> 00:53:35.011
Like post fix notation, I will
be able to make use of my stack

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11169-1
00:53:35.011 --> 00:53:36.628
and I will be able to do that.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11172-0
00:53:38.588 --> 00:53:38.788
Right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11176-0
00:53:40.248 --> 00:53:40.798
He asked Ruby.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11182-0
00:53:40.808 --> 00:53:41.658
Yeah, this is the example.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11200-0
00:53:41.728 --> 00:53:45.786
Prefix is this, let's say B -, C
These are all examples of

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11200-1
00:53:45.786 --> 00:53:46.268
prefix.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11214-0
00:53:48.108 --> 00:53:49.988
In this clear guys, we all go
through the appendix.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11218-0
00:53:51.458 --> 00:53:52.568
That is a separate algorithm.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11237-0
00:53:52.578 --> 00:53:55.585
Yeah, that's a separate
algorithm on how to use a stack

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11237-1
00:53:55.585 --> 00:53:56.928
in order to convert this.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11258-0
00:53:57.858 --> 00:54:01.362
Right there is another one,
which is how do you evaluate

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11258-1
00:54:01.362 --> 00:54:03.268
this postfix expression, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11270-0
00:54:03.438 --> 00:54:05.608
There's a post fix expression
given to you.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11283-0
00:54:05.758 --> 00:54:09.068
How do you evaluate and get the
final answer for that?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11297-0
00:54:09.078 --> 00:54:11.909
Also we can use stack and that
is the example I'll show you

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11297-1
00:54:11.909 --> 00:54:12.098
now.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11311-0
00:54:14.488 --> 00:54:17.488
Add a ) at the end of the
arithmetic expression.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11318-0
00:54:17.498 --> 00:54:20.208
Yes, this CF is in which
notation?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11324-0
00:54:20.518 --> 00:54:21.578
Can someone correctly guess
that?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11326-0
00:54:26.628 --> 00:54:26.788
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11331-0
00:54:28.598 --> 00:54:29.168
Exactly.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11343-0
00:54:29.338 --> 00:54:31.448
Post fix whatever is given to us
is not in.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11352-0
00:54:31.458 --> 00:54:32.868
In fix that is in post fix.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11361-0
00:54:33.418 --> 00:54:35.428
Yeah, there is already an
algorithm.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11378-0
00:54:35.438 --> 00:54:39.026
It has converted infix to
postfix and that post fix

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11378-1
00:54:39.026 --> 00:54:39.648
notation.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11387-0
00:54:39.658 --> 00:54:42.708
We are now evaluating to get
that final answer right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11401-0
00:54:42.758 --> 00:54:44.498
So this F is in postfix
notation.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11427-0
00:54:45.688 --> 00:54:49.215
Scan that from left to right and
repeat steps three and four till

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11427-1
00:54:49.215 --> 00:54:52.048
we reach that Sentinel bracket
that we had only put.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11437-0
00:54:52.228 --> 00:54:53.988
So this is just the end of
marker guys.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11446-0
00:54:53.998 --> 00:54:56.178
You can just put, you know
whatever you like.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11460-0
00:54:56.468 --> 00:55:00.149
Yeah, that that is to denote
that my algorithm is over

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11460-1
00:55:00.149 --> 00:55:00.618
though.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11490-0
00:55:00.758 --> 00:55:04.307
Is the algorithm say if an
operand is encountered, put it

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11490-1
00:55:04.307 --> 00:55:06.878
onto the stack or push it onto
the stack.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11495-0
00:55:07.378 --> 00:55:08.818
If an operator is encoded.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11500-0
00:55:08.828 --> 00:55:09.528
Yeah, very important.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11505-0
00:55:09.538 --> 00:55:10.668
This is not multiply.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11511-0
00:55:10.718 --> 00:55:11.738
This is just a placeholder.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11516-0
00:55:12.528 --> 00:55:13.998
This indicates any operator.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11529-0
00:55:14.148 --> 00:55:17.578
OK, it can be placed minus into,
you know, power.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11541-0
00:55:17.588 --> 00:55:20.671
Whatever you know, operator, if
you encounter that, then what

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11541-1
00:55:20.671 --> 00:55:21.368
should you do?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11569-0
00:55:22.828 --> 00:55:27.998
Remove the two top elements from
the stack where yen one is the

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11569-1
00:55:27.998 --> 00:55:32.118
top element and N2 is the next
to two top element.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11585-0
00:55:32.708 --> 00:55:36.658
Perform N 2 Operation, N One
you'll get an answer right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11592-0
00:55:36.728 --> 00:55:38.738
Place the result back onto the
stack.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11596-0
00:55:39.248 --> 00:55:40.198
Keep doing this.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11608-0
00:55:40.388 --> 00:55:43.128
Ultimately, what you have in the
stack is the final answer.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11613-0
00:55:44.208 --> 00:55:45.098
Yeah, let's do this.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11618-0
00:55:45.108 --> 00:55:45.978
It'll be even more clear.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11630-0
00:55:48.048 --> 00:55:50.718
Evaluate this expression and
answers have been given.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11635-0
00:55:50.728 --> 00:55:51.778
So what notation is this?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11647-0
00:55:55.458 --> 00:55:56.818
Actually was, so we had this.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11653-0
00:55:56.968 --> 00:55:58.358
What notation is this?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11667-0
00:55:58.808 --> 00:56:02.738
The operator is coming after the
you know operandi AB plus.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11676-0
00:56:02.908 --> 00:56:03.888
So it is in postfix.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11702-0
00:56:05.048 --> 00:56:08.623
So as a first step, let me just
substitute them right for one

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11702-1
00:56:08.623 --> 00:56:12.198
for a M substituting one for BM,
putting 2 for CM, putting 3.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11723-0
00:56:12.288 --> 00:56:15.607
So I've substituted that and
I've got this and I have added

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11723-1
00:56:15.607 --> 00:56:16.658
this extra bracket.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11735-0
00:56:16.668 --> 00:56:20.328
Also, I have only added it when
I come to that bracket.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11743-0
00:56:20.338 --> 00:56:21.748
I know that the algorithm is
over.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11749-0
00:56:21.788 --> 00:56:23.328
I will stop it there, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11753-0
00:56:23.338 --> 00:56:24.068
Just like a marker.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11758-0
00:56:26.298 --> 00:56:26.508
One.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11762-0
00:56:26.518 --> 00:56:27.138
So let's get started.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11773-0
00:56:28.168 --> 00:56:29.838
I prefer to do this using a
table.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11780-0
00:56:29.918 --> 00:56:32.168
You can also follow that if you
like, yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11794-0
00:56:34.628 --> 00:56:36.738
Will this work only for
arithmetic logical as well?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11807-0
00:56:36.748 --> 00:56:39.718
If yes, if what it will work
only for arithmetic.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11815-0
00:56:39.728 --> 00:56:42.750
Yeah, this is for arithmetic
evaluation, not logical

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11815-1
00:56:42.750 --> 00:56:43.378
evaluation.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11819-0
00:56:44.188 --> 00:56:44.348
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11822-0
00:56:45.838 --> 00:56:46.058
Cool.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11824-0
00:56:46.068 --> 00:56:46.658
Let's get started.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11839-0
00:56:48.448 --> 00:56:51.078
Sky left to go from left to
right, right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11852-0
00:56:51.128 --> 00:56:55.378
First I encounter a symbol one,
so is 1 an operator or operand?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11856-0
00:56:57.348 --> 00:56:58.018
Yeah, real quick.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11889-0
00:57:00.578 --> 00:57:04.145
Operand correct while push it
onto the stack so the stack in

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11889-1
00:57:04.145 --> 00:57:07.128
this case my example is growing
in this direction.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11909-0
00:57:08.188 --> 00:57:11.574
In this direction guys, instead
of something like this, it is

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11909-1
00:57:11.574 --> 00:57:13.978
growing in this direction all
are the same.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11925-0
00:57:14.368 --> 00:57:18.338
Yeah, so now it is stack is 1
again I encounter 2.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11938-0
00:57:18.348 --> 00:57:21.178
Two is also an operand, so I
push it onto the stack.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11942-0
00:57:21.508 --> 00:57:22.238
Something like that.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11951-0
00:57:22.248 --> 00:57:23.668
So who's the topmost element
here?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11956-0
00:57:26.048 --> 00:57:26.398
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11964-0
00:57:26.448 --> 00:57:28.138
Who's the topmost element here?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/11970-0
00:57:28.668 --> 00:57:29.338
Yeah, very good.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12003-0
00:57:29.388 --> 00:57:33.303
22 is the topmost element and
then I am going to a place less

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12003-1
00:57:33.303 --> 00:57:37.345
is an operator, so if it is an
operator, what did the algorithm

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12003-2
00:57:37.345 --> 00:57:37.598
say?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12028-0
00:57:38.128 --> 00:57:43.421
It told Pop the top two elements
the top most element is north

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12028-1
00:57:43.421 --> 00:57:46.698
one, the second of most element
is N2.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12045-0
00:57:47.658 --> 00:57:54.707
Perform in two Operation N One
that is N2 is 1 and then N N1 is

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12045-1
00:57:54.707 --> 00:57:54.928
2.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12060-0
00:57:55.298 --> 00:57:58.168
I do this operation plus that is
1 + 2 is 3.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12068-0
00:57:58.578 --> 00:57:59.638
I get an answer three.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12077-0
00:58:00.518 --> 00:58:02.408
Put that answer again back to
the stack.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12091-0
00:58:02.938 --> 00:58:06.398
Right, so now only three is
there in the stack, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12100-0
00:58:06.608 --> 00:58:07.948
Again, encounter a new three.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12118-0
00:58:07.958 --> 00:58:12.589
This three right three is an
operand, so push it onto the

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12118-1
00:58:12.589 --> 00:58:13.068
stack.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12123-0
00:58:13.078 --> 00:58:13.688
Yeah, very good.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12131-0
00:58:13.778 --> 00:58:16.338
Top element is 3 now also
topped.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12163-0
00:58:16.348 --> 00:58:20.651
This is the top most this, the
second top most encounter a

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12163-1
00:58:20.651 --> 00:58:25.246
minus, so pop the topmost second
topmost, perform N 2 up north

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12163-2
00:58:25.246 --> 00:58:25.538
one.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12175-0
00:58:25.548 --> 00:58:27.648
I got zero again push it onto
the stack.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12182-0
00:58:28.438 --> 00:58:30.458
That encounter 2.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12190-0
00:58:31.168 --> 00:58:32.158
Push it onto the stack.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12210-0
00:58:32.268 --> 00:58:35.868
I encounter one feet on to the
stack, so now my stack looks

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12210-1
00:58:35.868 --> 00:58:37.188
like this zero to one.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12221-0
00:58:37.898 --> 00:58:40.068
You guys will tell me what is
the topmost here?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12229-0
00:58:41.598 --> 00:58:42.708
Who is the topmost?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12237-0
00:58:42.858 --> 00:58:44.098
Who is this second topmost?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12257-0
00:58:47.768 --> 00:58:52.368
Yeah, one is the top post,
second is the two is the second

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12257-1
00:58:52.368 --> 00:58:53.538
top most right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12269-0
00:58:53.788 --> 00:58:55.118
So now I'm getting a plus
symbol.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12271-0
00:58:55.128 --> 00:58:55.738
Here again I'm.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12279-0
00:58:55.748 --> 00:58:57.298
I'm scanning this expression
guys.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12286-0
00:58:57.308 --> 00:58:58.318
Yeah, one by one.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12326-0
00:58:58.328 --> 00:59:02.390
I'm getting this to one plus
this plus is what I'm currently

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12326-1
00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:06.386
at, so an encounter that plus I
bought this one that is N1I

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12326-2
00:59:06.386 --> 00:59:08.718
popped this two only two
elements.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12344-0
00:59:08.728 --> 00:59:13.129
You should pop the top most
becomes N1, the next one becomes

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12344-1
00:59:13.129 --> 00:59:13.418
N 2.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12363-0
00:59:13.668 --> 00:59:18.098
You are doing N2 0PN one, so you
are doing 2 + 1 not 1 + 2.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12371-0
00:59:18.528 --> 00:59:19.898
Yeah, 2 + 1 is 3.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12377-0
00:59:20.288 --> 00:59:21.318
You got the answer 3.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12383-0
00:59:21.648 --> 00:59:23.038
So these two only got removed.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12390-0
00:59:23.048 --> 00:59:24.418
Zero was already there, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12399-0
00:59:24.508 --> 00:59:25.738
So the zero is already there.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12415-0
00:59:26.028 --> 00:59:29.712
This new answer three also you
are pushing so it became 0 comma

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12415-1
00:59:29.712 --> 00:59:30.058
three.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12426-0
00:59:30.348 --> 00:59:33.068
This is my stack status now
again have a 3.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12443-0
00:59:33.078 --> 00:59:36.428
Here is an operand, so I push it
onto the stack.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12462-0
00:59:36.578 --> 00:59:42.388
So 033 I have a power symbol, so
I pop this three.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12486-0
00:59:42.438 --> 00:59:47.048
This three I do three power
Operation, 3 right 3 into 3 into

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12486-1
00:59:47.048 --> 00:59:50.148
3 right or three power right
that is 27.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12499-0
00:59:50.638 --> 00:59:52.968
So I again push it onto the
stack.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12515-0
00:59:53.038 --> 00:59:56.648
So I have zero comma 27 there, I
have a minus symbol.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12526-0
00:59:57.168 --> 01:00:00.348
So this 27 top most becomes N1.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12532-0
01:00:00.418 --> 01:00:02.528
The zero becomes N2 always.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12551-0
01:00:02.538 --> 01:00:07.168
We were doing N 2 operation and
one so 0 -, 27 is minus 27.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12581-0
01:00:07.518 --> 01:00:11.471
I push it onto the stack and now
I have encountered my last

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12581-1
01:00:11.471 --> 01:00:15.358
bracket which I had only put, so
I will stop my algorithm.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12593-0
01:00:16.358 --> 01:00:18.658
Whatever is there in the stack,
I'll pop it.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12609-0
01:00:20.048 --> 01:00:23.388
That will become my final answer
and my staff will become empty.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12620-0
01:00:25.248 --> 01:00:26.228
I'll tell you a small trick.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12637-0
01:00:27.288 --> 01:00:31.240
If you complete this properly,
exactly how we did now and in

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12637-1
01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:31.888
the stack.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12660-0
01:00:31.898 --> 01:00:35.321
If you have multiple items, if
you have multi here we had only

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12660-1
01:00:35.321 --> 01:00:36.898
minus 27 which is the answer.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12671-0
01:00:37.178 --> 01:00:40.986
But if you have multiple
answers, then there are two

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12671-1
01:00:40.986 --> 01:00:41.418
cases.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12726-0
01:00:41.888 --> 01:00:46.128
Either you have made a mistake
as simple as that you have made

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12726-1
01:00:46.128 --> 01:00:50.504
a mistake somewhere and that is
why you have multiple answers in

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12726-2
01:00:50.504 --> 01:00:54.677
the stack at the end or or the
other case would be this given

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12726-3
01:00:54.677 --> 01:00:58.716
expression itself is a wrong
expression, then also that can

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12726-4
01:00:58.716 --> 01:00:59.188
happen.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12728-0
01:01:00.638 --> 01:01:00.868
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12734-0
01:01:00.878 --> 01:01:01.348
Is this clear?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12765-0
01:01:01.358 --> 01:01:04.492
Guys, all of you in this
example, if you saw properly you

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12765-1
01:01:04.492 --> 01:01:07.897
had at the end of the you know
some you had only one answer in

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12765-2
01:01:07.897 --> 01:01:08.438
the stack.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12771-0
01:01:08.448 --> 01:01:09.438
That is the correct answer.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12791-0
01:01:10.028 --> 01:01:14.132
If there are multiple, you have
made a mistake or this given

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12791-1
01:01:14.132 --> 01:01:17.228
question itself is a wrong
expression, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12793-0
01:01:18.948 --> 01:01:19.358
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12800-0
01:01:19.428 --> 01:01:20.618
No, you will be given. Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12839-0
01:01:20.628 --> 01:01:23.743
So you can verify your steps and
if you have done everything

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12839-1
01:01:23.743 --> 01:01:26.859
correctly then you can claim
that you know what the question

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12839-2
01:01:26.859 --> 01:01:29.668
itself is wrong or there are
other sophisticated ones.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12852-0
01:01:29.678 --> 01:01:33.490
That is, you can reconvert this
into infix notation, and that

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12852-1
01:01:33.490 --> 01:01:33.798
will.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12868-0
01:01:33.868 --> 01:01:37.182
That will have something like a
+, -, B, something like that,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12868-1
01:01:37.182 --> 01:01:38.358
which is wrong, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12876-0
01:01:38.368 --> 01:01:39.938
You can verify and prove like
that.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12887-0
01:01:40.558 --> 01:01:41.948
I'll not put you into all the
trouble.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12904-0
01:01:41.958 --> 01:01:44.381
Yeah, I'll give you a valid
expression, if at all this comes

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12904-1
01:01:44.381 --> 01:01:44.858
in the exam.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12922-0
01:01:45.608 --> 01:01:48.500
Yeah, but if you make some
mistakes, you will have multiple

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12922-1
01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:50.188
things here in this stack
finally.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12935-0
01:01:52.158 --> 01:01:55.258
Yeah, you just example clear
guys for all of you.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12941-0
01:01:56.778 --> 01:01:58.708
There are no element, is there?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12953-0
01:01:58.718 --> 01:01:59.928
You are taking N2A0?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12956-0
01:01:59.938 --> 01:02:00.718
No, not at all.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12964-0
01:02:00.728 --> 01:02:02.388
There is an element 0 here,
right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12970-0
01:02:04.258 --> 01:02:05.918
Zero is here, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12987-0
01:02:08.038 --> 01:02:09.888
There was the answer I got here
and that was pushed.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/12997-0
01:02:11.308 --> 01:02:12.878
I'm not clear on the three power
three.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13004-0
01:02:12.888 --> 01:02:13.588
What is 3 power?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13012-0
01:02:13.598 --> 01:02:16.288
Three, that nothing but three
power.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13014-0
01:02:16.298 --> 01:02:16.838
Three guys?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13033-0
01:02:17.308 --> 01:02:22.888
Yeah, that's like 3 square into
three, right, 99 into 327.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13046-0
01:02:22.958 --> 01:02:26.206
That one, what would happen if
the last no operator present

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13046-1
01:02:26.206 --> 01:02:26.748
like this?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13054-0
01:02:26.808 --> 01:02:28.218
Uh, case minus will not be
present.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13061-0
01:02:29.548 --> 01:02:30.828
No, this is not a minus.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13067-0
01:02:30.838 --> 01:02:33.058
Yeah, this is nil here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13085-0
01:02:33.068 --> 01:02:35.246
Yeah, if this minus is not
present, then there is something

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13085-1
01:02:35.246 --> 01:02:36.808
wrong with the expression
itself, correct?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13087-0
01:02:40.768 --> 01:02:40.928
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13101-0
01:02:44.228 --> 01:02:45.858
Can you explain the last of
which step?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13114-0
01:02:45.868 --> 01:02:49.118
So I'm not sure why you are
getting unnecessarily confused.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13119-0
01:02:49.208 --> 01:02:50.708
So till here is everyone clear?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13121-0
01:02:51.898 --> 01:02:52.168
Yes.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13125-0
01:02:52.178 --> 01:02:52.678
No, all of you.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13148-0
01:02:57.018 --> 01:02:59.831
Yes, we are only put that, yeah,
so that is why you have to be

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13148-1
01:02:59.831 --> 01:03:00.948
really careful about now.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13153-0
01:03:00.958 --> 01:03:02.588
Yeah, every slide is important.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13168-0
01:03:02.968 --> 01:03:06.119
They're very step first step
says add this to the end of the

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13168-1
01:03:06.119 --> 01:03:06.688
expression.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13170-0
01:03:07.198 --> 01:03:07.488
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13197-0
01:03:07.498 --> 01:03:11.004
So if you see here here itself
that bracket was not there, I

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13197-1
01:03:11.004 --> 01:03:13.648
only added it when I approached
that bracket.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13203-0
01:03:13.658 --> 01:03:14.818
I know my problem is over.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13216-0
01:03:15.328 --> 01:03:16.948
Yeah, that's like an end of line
marker.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13222-0
01:03:17.738 --> 01:03:19.128
I could have put anything for
that.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13238-0
01:03:19.138 --> 01:03:21.710
Yeah, it doesn't matter that you
have to put that close bracket.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13238-1
01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:21.908
Only.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13258-0
01:03:22.158 --> 01:03:25.664
I can put something else like
dollar or something also which

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13258-1
01:03:25.664 --> 01:03:27.848
is not a valid operator in Max
right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13267-0
01:03:27.858 --> 01:03:30.348
You can put anything build this
line.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13269-0
01:03:30.358 --> 01:03:31.168
Everyone is clear.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13279-0
01:03:31.418 --> 01:03:33.648
Yeah, I have three things here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13290-0
01:03:35.238 --> 01:03:39.388
I encountered an operator, so
this three became popped out.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13306-0
01:03:39.438 --> 01:03:42.863
These three also popped out, but
zero is still here 0 still there

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13306-1
01:03:42.863 --> 01:03:43.538
in the stack.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13311-0
01:03:44.338 --> 01:03:46.828
Yeah, I did this.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13342-0
01:03:47.378 --> 01:03:51.524
I got answer as 3 into 3 into 3
which is 27 and that also I

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13342-1
01:03:51.524 --> 01:03:55.048
pushed it here and then I again
got a subtraction.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13351-0
01:03:55.518 --> 01:03:57.708
So I popped this 27 here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13359-0
01:03:57.818 --> 01:03:59.288
I popped this zero here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13371-0
01:03:59.418 --> 01:04:02.878
I did 0 -, 27 which is minus 27,
right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13382-0
01:04:02.888 --> 01:04:05.408
So both of these were popped, so
stack was empty.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13399-0
01:04:05.658 --> 01:04:11.044
This minus 27 alone got pushed
and now I encountered this final

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13399-1
01:04:11.044 --> 01:04:11.718
bracket.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13411-0
01:04:11.728 --> 01:04:14.468
So my problem is over and this
27 is my answer.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13423-0
01:04:15.988 --> 01:04:17.358
Wait, please perform Beaver.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13430-0
01:04:17.458 --> 01:04:18.918
Yeah, what about this
expression?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13435-0
01:04:19.268 --> 01:04:20.608
This place is coming here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13444-0
01:04:20.618 --> 01:04:23.158
This is coming way later,
correct.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13460-0
01:04:25.138 --> 01:04:27.788
So I am going from left to right
one after the other.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13486-0
01:04:27.798 --> 01:04:31.339
So first, if this place comes,
I'm already doing it, then I'm

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13486-1
01:04:31.339 --> 01:04:34.652
encountering this minus I'm
doing that this place I'll do

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13486-2
01:04:34.652 --> 01:04:34.938
next.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13498-0
01:04:34.948 --> 01:04:37.190
Then I'll do this power, and
then I'll do the subtraction,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13498-1
01:04:37.190 --> 01:04:37.418
right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13505-0
01:04:39.668 --> 01:04:40.548
Yeah, RUMIK, is that clear?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13514-0
01:04:44.338 --> 01:04:45.078
What is 0 -?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13523-0
01:04:45.088 --> 01:04:46.828
21 If we go left to right, yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13559-0
01:04:46.838 --> 01:04:50.541
So that is what again and again
I was selling expression, we are

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13559-1
01:04:50.541 --> 01:04:53.902
scanning from left to right,
whereas operation here we are

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13559-2
01:04:53.902 --> 01:04:55.498
doing end to open one right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13572-0
01:04:55.908 --> 01:04:58.608
So this is the topmost which
goes to N1.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13598-0
01:04:59.298 --> 01:05:04.377
This zero goes to end two, so we
are doing N2O, PN, 10 minus N 1

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13598-1
01:05:04.377 --> 01:05:04.768
here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13607-0
01:05:04.778 --> 01:05:06.488
Also, we are doing 2 + 1 not.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13614-0
01:05:06.498 --> 01:05:07.768
We are doing 1 + 2.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13626-0
01:05:09.028 --> 01:05:11.432
Yeah, if you do it the other
way, you will get a wrong

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13626-1
01:05:11.432 --> 01:05:11.738
answer.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13630-0
01:05:11.748 --> 01:05:11.848
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13652-0
01:05:12.478 --> 01:05:16.263
And that is also because there's
a beautiful logic behind why we

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13652-1
01:05:16.263 --> 01:05:17.428
are doing N 2 N one.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13667-0
01:05:17.938 --> 01:05:22.629
That is to you know, follow your
math rules like this bot mass

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13667-1
01:05:22.629 --> 01:05:23.448
and others.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13685-0
01:05:24.298 --> 01:05:27.088
Yeah, if you don't use that,
then you'll do N1.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13691-0
01:05:27.098 --> 01:05:28.438
Open two, you'll get wrong
answers.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13695-0
01:05:29.518 --> 01:05:30.938
Cool 2.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13697-0
01:05:30.948 --> 01:05:31.478
Practice it.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13700-0
01:05:31.488 --> 01:05:31.668
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13719-0
01:05:31.678 --> 01:05:35.280
When I talk about this, it'll
all seem fine, but no practice

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13719-1
01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:35.458
it.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13727-0
01:05:36.008 --> 01:05:37.468
I have a couple of questions for
you here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13736-0
01:05:38.208 --> 01:05:41.678
Yeah, this is all a boost fix
expression.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13755-0
01:05:41.688 --> 01:05:45.124
Substitute the values, add A
bracket here and try to solve

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13755-1
01:05:45.124 --> 01:05:45.998
these problems.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13768-0
01:05:46.508 --> 01:05:49.738
But there are two problems that
I've given you exactly same way.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13773-0
01:05:49.748 --> 01:05:50.358
Try to do it.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13779-0
01:05:50.368 --> 01:05:51.838
Please don't do anything else.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13816-0
01:05:51.848 --> 01:05:55.483
Yeah, line by line if you do it
also it's fine or do it like a

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13816-1
01:05:55.483 --> 01:05:58.887
table like this and exactly
trace it like how we have done

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13816-2
01:05:58.887 --> 01:06:00.618
it will not make any mistakes.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13826-0
01:06:02.108 --> 01:06:04.018
Yeah, you cannot do it for
infix.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13851-0
01:06:04.028 --> 01:06:07.368
This algorithm is only for
postfix, so if you have an infix

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13851-1
01:06:07.368 --> 01:06:09.038
notation, there are two steps.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13940-0
01:06:10.398 --> 01:06:14.860
If you have in fix first you
have to convert that expression

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13940-1
01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:19.395
itself into postfix and then
that postfix expression you need

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13940-2
01:06:19.395 --> 01:06:23.785
to evaluate and for converting
in fix to this also my stack

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13940-3
01:06:23.785 --> 01:06:28.320
will help me and to evaluate
also my stack will help me right

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13940-4
01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:32.855
and this conversion algorithm I
have given it in this deck in

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13940-5
01:06:32.855 --> 01:06:37.537
Appendix Appendix this is there
and this post fix evaluation we

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13940-6
01:06:37.537 --> 01:06:40.098
have learned it now is this
clear?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13945-0
01:06:42.198 --> 01:06:42.428
Cool.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13956-0
01:06:42.438 --> 01:06:44.692
If that is clear, you can
actually take a very quick

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13956-1
01:06:44.692 --> 01:06:44.948
break.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13963-0
01:06:44.958 --> 01:06:46.248
We'll come back in 5 minutes.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13980-0
01:06:46.778 --> 01:06:50.165
Yeah, while converting the infix
to postfix, the operators follow

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13980-1
01:06:50.165 --> 01:06:51.038
selectivity, yes.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/13985-0
01:06:51.448 --> 01:06:52.248
Yeah, it will follow.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14038-0
01:06:53.878 --> 01:06:57.344
We take a very short 5 minute
break and then we'll be back and

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14038-1
01:06:57.344 --> 01:07:00.865
for this the also trick is that
once you complete this problems

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14038-2
01:07:00.865 --> 01:07:04.277
you can actually go to this URL
and if you paste this problem

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14038-3
01:07:04.277 --> 01:07:07.028
you'll actually get the complete
table like this.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14042-0
01:07:07.538 --> 01:07:08.828
You can verify this solution.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14060-0
01:07:10.458 --> 01:07:12.845
Yeah, you need not wait for me
or you need not wait for your

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14060-1
01:07:12.845 --> 01:07:13.158
friends.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14072-0
01:07:13.948 --> 01:07:16.498
You can actually verify your own
answer is correct or not.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14081-0
01:07:16.768 --> 01:07:18.558
Yeah, please don't directly go
put there.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14088-0
01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:21.538
Yeah, do it on your own.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14095-0
01:07:22.628 --> 01:07:24.578
See how stack is being used.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14108-0
01:07:24.628 --> 01:07:27.958
See the correct answer and then
try to put it in this URL.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14120-0
01:07:28.508 --> 01:07:31.921
It's called postfix evaluator
and then you can see your

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14120-1
01:07:31.921 --> 01:07:32.348
answer.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14149-0
01:07:42.208 --> 01:07:44.554
For one question on stack
operations to delete bottom

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14149-1
01:07:44.554 --> 01:07:47.075
element, we might end up
deleting all the elements before

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14149-2
01:07:47.075 --> 01:07:47.858
bottom 1, correct?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14160-0
01:07:48.068 --> 01:07:50.278
So we might lose all the
elements before bottom one.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14172-0
01:07:50.288 --> 01:07:51.258
Yes, that's right, Ajay.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14178-0
01:07:51.958 --> 01:07:53.428
That is the whole point of spec.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14181-0
01:07:53.958 --> 01:07:54.358
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14193-0
01:07:54.408 --> 01:07:56.628
For example, there is a stack of
rotis.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14205-0
01:07:57.118 --> 01:07:59.988
If you want to remove the bottom
one, you cannot do that.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14231-0
01:08:00.258 --> 01:08:03.032
You'll have to eat all the
routes and then take the last

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14231-1
01:08:03.032 --> 01:08:05.758
one, meaning you would have to
delete all the top ones.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14236-0
01:08:07.448 --> 01:08:08.628
That is by design here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14239-0
01:08:10.578 --> 01:08:10.998
Here here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14250-0
01:08:21.198 --> 01:08:22.168
Yeah, that is the whole point.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14276-0
01:08:22.178 --> 01:08:25.731
Krishna, you have to put it in
the canvas discussion and chit

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14276-1
01:08:25.731 --> 01:08:29.054
chat with others and you know
see if you are in the right

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14276-2
01:08:29.054 --> 01:08:29.628
direction.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14283-0
01:08:29.698 --> 01:08:31.358
I have multiple people got the
same answer.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14298-0
01:08:34.118 --> 01:08:35.978
If I'm giving the answer then
there is no point, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14305-0
01:08:37.598 --> 01:08:39.208
Yeah, you have to make your
connections.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14320-0
01:08:41.358 --> 01:08:43.841
So by now we all know at least
fifty other people in your

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14320-1
01:08:43.841 --> 01:08:44.098
class.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14327-0
01:08:56.378 --> 01:08:58.198
Yeah, no.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14346-0
01:09:00.178 --> 01:09:04.190
That's saddening to here, at
least these activities will make

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14346-1
01:09:04.190 --> 01:09:04.838
you do it.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14377-0
01:09:04.848 --> 01:09:08.313
Yeah, in the canvas, you know,
just stack people ask them for,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14377-1
01:09:08.313 --> 01:09:11.393
you know, if your answers are
right, you will have your

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14377-2
01:09:11.393 --> 01:09:13.098
assignments in another 10 days.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14386-0
01:09:13.188 --> 01:09:15.278
Yeah, you'll be working in
groups.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14389-0
01:09:15.608 --> 01:09:16.118
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14399-0
01:09:16.488 --> 01:09:18.298
So don't even know who's the
group member.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14405-0
01:09:18.508 --> 01:09:20.918
Then how would you do justice,
right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14419-0
01:09:31.828 --> 01:09:35.278
And then will Peter's even more
very important?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14433-0
01:09:35.288 --> 01:09:40.178
Yeah, because in your in on
campus, students stay together.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14443-0
01:09:40.188 --> 01:09:41.648
They're in the same hostel and
so on.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14453-0
01:09:41.658 --> 01:09:42.838
And you know that happens.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14474-0
01:09:43.718 --> 01:09:46.435
But in WILP, if you are not
making any connections then it

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14474-1
01:09:46.435 --> 01:09:48.278
really becomes difficult after a
point.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14481-0
01:09:50.138 --> 01:09:52.338
It is star 12 four in question.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14486-0
01:09:52.398 --> 01:09:54.428
Uh, where, exactly?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14489-0
01:09:54.438 --> 01:09:55.028
Yeah, correct.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14499-0
01:09:55.148 --> 01:09:56.718
Yeah, so this is multiply.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14513-0
01:09:56.728 --> 01:09:59.258
This 12 is a single number and
this four is a single number.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14522-0
01:09:59.608 --> 01:10:01.188
Here 24 is also single number.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14524-0
01:10:02.298 --> 01:10:02.818
There's here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14532-0
01:10:02.828 --> 01:10:03.748
There's a space right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14537-0
01:10:03.758 --> 01:10:05.228
575 rolls out, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14547-0
01:10:09.308 --> 01:10:11.748
OK, already got assignments for
two subjects. Nice.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14569-0
01:10:21.758 --> 01:10:24.501
But as Inman groups are just
small right SURYA, you might

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14569-1
01:10:24.501 --> 01:10:25.968
know just another four or five.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14580-0
01:10:26.028 --> 01:10:28.808
Maybe, but what about 5000
people?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14589-0
01:10:30.478 --> 01:10:32.728
That should also be one of your
hidden agendas.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14593-0
01:10:32.738 --> 01:10:33.628
Sort of this program.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14605-0
01:10:34.068 --> 01:10:37.706
Right to make a lot more
connections learn from each

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14605-1
01:10:37.706 --> 01:10:38.118
other.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14620-0
01:10:40.348 --> 01:10:43.528
Make job referrals or maybe one
of you start a company.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14633-0
01:10:43.578 --> 01:10:46.773
You can, you know, high to your
friends, or that can happen,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14633-1
01:10:46.773 --> 01:10:47.088
right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14652-0
01:10:58.708 --> 01:11:01.085
One general question, why are we
not allowed to watch other

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14652-1
01:11:01.085 --> 01:11:01.838
section recordings?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14654-0
01:11:01.848 --> 01:11:02.238
Section 2.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14662-0
01:11:02.248 --> 01:11:03.978
People want to listen to your
sessions.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14676-0
01:11:04.388 --> 01:11:07.348
OK, let's let's forget about the
online mode for now.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14692-0
01:11:07.548 --> 01:11:10.218
And if you are in a real
classroom, will you be able to

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14692-1
01:11:10.218 --> 01:11:11.268
attend in two classes?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14696-0
01:11:13.948 --> 01:11:14.418
Yeah, venkat.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14720-0
01:11:17.738 --> 01:11:21.427
Mehta and S1 also is still not
so matured where you are sitting

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14720-1
01:11:21.427 --> 01:11:22.868
in two classrooms, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14726-0
01:11:23.828 --> 01:11:24.918
So that's the same principle.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14730-0
01:11:25.008 --> 01:11:25.418
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14745-0
01:11:25.428 --> 01:11:28.288
We follow the same guideline,
even if it is online or offline.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14750-0
01:11:28.788 --> 01:11:30.378
A student belongs to one
section.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14762-0
01:11:30.548 --> 01:11:33.418
Yeah, which is what, you know,
it is you.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14767-0
01:11:33.428 --> 01:11:34.468
You belong to that section.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14781-0
01:11:34.478 --> 01:11:38.590
You follow that and these are
unnecessary confusions on, you

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14781-1
01:11:38.590 --> 01:11:38.928
know.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14794-0
01:11:38.938 --> 01:11:42.074
But topic wise I will guarantee
that it is exactly the same

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14794-1
01:11:42.074 --> 01:11:42.388
topic.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14804-0
01:11:42.398 --> 01:11:44.588
It is exactly the same depth. We
will be covering.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14811-0
01:11:45.038 --> 01:11:45.728
Yeah, I know.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14816-0
01:11:45.738 --> 01:11:47.388
Raghu and Sarah, for, like
decades?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14830-0
01:11:47.938 --> 01:11:51.348
Exactly the same topic, exactly
the same thing will be covered.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14835-0
01:11:51.608 --> 01:11:52.448
There's nothing extra.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14841-0
01:11:52.458 --> 01:11:54.358
There's nothing less these
exercises.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14850-0
01:11:54.368 --> 01:11:55.888
Maybe I might be giving
something extra.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14865-0
01:11:55.898 --> 01:11:58.209
He might be giving something
else, but all this doesn't

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14865-1
01:11:58.209 --> 01:11:58.498
matter.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14878-0
01:11:58.508 --> 01:12:00.588
As I told, none of these
excesses will come in your exam.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14885-0
01:12:01.338 --> 01:12:02.118
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14900-0
01:12:04.468 --> 01:12:06.538
There is a 12, four and 24 in
the second question.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14903-0
01:12:06.548 --> 01:12:07.058
Yes, correct.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14906-0
01:12:07.148 --> 01:12:07.788
That's right, NANDINI.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14922-0
01:12:17.368 --> 01:12:19.938
So I would say is is assignment
mandatory?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14933-0
01:12:19.948 --> 01:12:21.478
What if you have missed any
assignment?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14949-0
01:12:21.488 --> 01:12:24.472
Then what will happen if we
still give another uh assignment

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14949-1
01:12:24.472 --> 01:12:25.108
and eligible?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14956-0
01:12:26.458 --> 01:12:27.628
But yeah, that is still
possible.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14975-0
01:12:27.638 --> 01:12:31.487
Yeah, if you if you don't give
an assignment then you'll get 0

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/14975-1
01:12:31.487 --> 01:12:32.648
on that assignment.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15014-0
01:12:32.958 --> 01:12:36.085
But if you are still able to
pull it off, for example, if you

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15014-1
01:12:36.085 --> 01:12:39.314
write the midterm exam, if you
write the final exam, and if you

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15014-2
01:12:39.314 --> 01:12:41.988
are able to still pass the
course, then that's fine.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15024-0
01:12:41.998 --> 01:12:44.568
Yeah, but mid semester and final
are mandatory.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15031-0
01:12:44.818 --> 01:12:45.668
You cannot tell that.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15069-0
01:12:45.678 --> 01:12:49.258
I'll do the assignments, but
I'll skip them at some store

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15069-1
01:12:49.258 --> 01:12:52.714
final EC2 exam and EC3 exam are
mandatory, whereas your

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15069-2
01:12:52.714 --> 01:12:54.258
assignments is up to you.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15090-0
01:12:54.268 --> 01:12:57.121
I mean, if you're confident that
you will clear the course only

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15090-1
01:12:57.121 --> 01:12:59.128
with midterm and final, then
it's up to you.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15104-0
01:13:01.288 --> 01:13:03.058
Cool guys, I think it's good
time for us to get started.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15122-0
01:13:03.068 --> 01:13:05.876
Let's you know chat about these
later, but yeah, you are on the

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15122-1
01:13:05.876 --> 01:13:06.578
right direction.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15142-0
01:13:07.048 --> 01:13:09.830
I do remember that you know,
these are the solutions, but you

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15142-1
01:13:09.830 --> 01:13:10.818
can also test it here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15171-0
01:13:10.828 --> 01:13:13.242
As I told once I upload the
slides, you can click on this

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15171-1
01:13:13.242 --> 01:13:15.740
URL, you can just copy paste
this question and you will get

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15171-2
01:13:15.740 --> 01:13:16.198
the answer.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15183-0
01:13:16.208 --> 01:13:19.818
Then yeah, and space is also you
will get of course, right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15206-0
01:13:19.828 --> 01:13:22.521
So once you get this question,
you can actually copy this line

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15206-1
01:13:22.521 --> 01:13:24.488
and you will know where the
spaces are. Cool.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15213-0
01:13:27.258 --> 01:13:27.488
Right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15219-0
01:13:27.498 --> 01:13:29.588
So let's get started with the
next data structure.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15228-0
01:13:29.898 --> 01:13:32.068
So what are the heart of?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15232-0
01:13:32.118 --> 01:13:32.658
You know stack.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15236-0
01:13:32.668 --> 01:13:33.738
What are the two operations
there?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15239-0
01:13:36.278 --> 01:13:36.578
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15245-0
01:13:36.588 --> 01:13:37.458
Can you real quick tell me.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15251-0
01:13:41.228 --> 01:13:42.248
Yeah, push and pop.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15265-0
01:13:42.258 --> 01:13:43.898
Yeah, push and pop are the heart
of it.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15279-0
01:13:43.908 --> 01:13:47.378
That is insert and remove and it
follows the paradigm of LIFO.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15287-0
01:13:47.848 --> 01:13:49.298
This is exactly the opposite of
it.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15345-0
01:13:50.188 --> 01:13:54.072
AQ differs from a stack in that
sense that it's insertion and

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15345-1
01:13:54.072 --> 01:13:57.830
removal routines follow FIFO,
meaning the first one will be

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15345-2
01:13:57.830 --> 01:14:01.526
the first one to get out, and
then he has these operations

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15345-3
01:14:01.526 --> 01:14:05.160
that is insertion, he's called
enquiring, and deletion or

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15345-4
01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:06.288
removal is called.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15382-0
01:14:06.298 --> 01:14:09.303
Dequeuing elements may be
inserted at any time, but only

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15382-1
01:14:09.303 --> 01:14:12.625
the element which has been in
the queue for the longest may be

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15382-2
01:14:12.625 --> 01:14:14.998
remote and who will be there in
the longest.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15407-0
01:14:15.588 --> 01:14:18.407
The one who enter in first
right, he was in the queue for a

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15407-1
01:14:18.407 --> 01:14:20.428
long time, so he'll be the one
to get out.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15426-0
01:14:22.018 --> 01:14:26.453
Elements are inserted at the
rear end and they are removed

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15426-1
01:14:26.453 --> 01:14:28.408
from the front end, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15439-0
01:14:28.658 --> 01:14:32.068
So elements go get joined here
in the rear end.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15447-0
01:14:32.398 --> 01:14:34.548
Now there is no one thing called
top.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15462-0
01:14:34.658 --> 01:14:37.358
Yeah, there are two things right
from the rear end.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15468-0
01:14:38.358 --> 01:14:40.648
Things will go get joined,
right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15488-0
01:14:40.958 --> 01:14:46.046
Get joined here in the queue and
from the front end people will

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15488-1
01:14:46.046 --> 01:14:47.478
get removed right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15504-0
01:14:48.538 --> 01:14:51.915
And insertion is called N
queuing and removal is called

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15504-1
01:14:51.915 --> 01:14:52.518
dequeuing.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15509-0
01:14:53.688 --> 01:14:54.588
Somebody life examples.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15519-0
01:14:55.658 --> 01:14:58.388
So for example, you have a toll
gate here, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15536-0
01:14:58.838 --> 01:15:02.004
So this is the first one, first
car to come in and he's standing

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15536-1
01:15:02.004 --> 01:15:02.248
here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15579-0
01:15:02.478 --> 01:15:06.646
He will be the first one to get
out, so this is the front end

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15579-1
01:15:06.646 --> 01:15:10.882
and this is the rear end where
newer cars are, you know, going

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15579-2
01:15:10.882 --> 01:15:14.378
on and standing enter from one
leaf from the other.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15605-0
01:15:14.388 --> 01:15:17.875
Exactly from the one you enter
is called errand from the one

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15605-1
01:15:17.875 --> 01:15:20.448
you leave is called as the front
end, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15629-0
01:15:20.658 --> 01:15:24.647
Similarly, for example, if there
is a banker here right, you will

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15629-1
01:15:24.647 --> 01:15:27.548
go get yourself added here in
the queue, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15638-0
01:15:27.748 --> 01:15:28.938
Who will be the first one to get
out?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15664-0
01:15:33.268 --> 01:15:36.555
Your life cues also have same
case where someone in the middle

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15664-1
01:15:36.555 --> 01:15:39.478
drops out and everyone behind
them moves up a position.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15670-0
01:15:39.488 --> 01:15:40.338
Yeah, you can do that.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15688-0
01:15:40.508 --> 01:15:43.544
Yeah, but in these type of
examples, we won't allow someone

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15688-1
01:15:43.544 --> 01:15:44.708
to, you know, drop out.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15692-0
01:15:44.718 --> 01:15:45.198
And so on.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15713-0
01:15:45.528 --> 01:15:49.207
Usually, yeah, but you can do
that if someone moves you can,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15713-1
01:15:49.207 --> 01:15:51.138
you know, compact the other one.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15727-0
01:15:51.148 --> 01:15:53.918
So one will go out first, then
two will go out and so on.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15754-0
01:15:54.108 --> 01:15:59.091
So then the teller is sitting in
which end and someone gets that

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15754-1
01:15:59.091 --> 01:16:00.088
Teller isn't.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15773-0
01:16:00.098 --> 01:16:03.916
Which end of the queue is he in
the front end or is he in the

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15773-1
01:16:03.916 --> 01:16:05.148
rear end? Very good?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15783-0
01:16:05.158 --> 01:16:06.258
Yeah, he's in the front end.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15800-0
01:16:07.168 --> 01:16:10.560
From print you get removed and
in the rare end people are going

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15800-1
01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:11.938
and standing in the queue.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15814-0
01:16:13.868 --> 01:16:15.928
Well, is the concept clear for
all of you?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15826-0
01:16:16.018 --> 01:16:19.038
3-4 first one gets out first.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15829-0
01:16:19.488 --> 01:16:19.618
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15839-0
01:16:21.038 --> 01:16:24.728
The last one we'll get out last
simple stuff.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15841-0
01:16:24.798 --> 01:16:24.918
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15857-0
01:16:26.118 --> 01:16:29.070
What are the different
operations that you can do in

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15857-1
01:16:29.070 --> 01:16:29.628
the stack?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15862-0
01:16:29.638 --> 01:16:30.548
You can do top.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15868-0
01:16:30.598 --> 01:16:31.338
You can do push.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15876-0
01:16:31.348 --> 01:16:32.748
You can do pop all that.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15892-0
01:16:33.588 --> 01:16:36.918
Here you can do NQ, NQ, meaning
insert, right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15906-0
01:16:37.148 --> 01:16:39.528
If you want to insert, do you
want to have an element?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15910-0
01:16:40.428 --> 01:16:41.338
Yes, right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15914-0
01:16:41.388 --> 01:16:42.168
This is O.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15928-0
01:16:42.938 --> 01:16:44.818
Yeah, this is the element that I
want to insert.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15940-0
01:16:45.968 --> 01:16:48.898
Great insert object O at the
rare of the queue.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15949-0
01:16:49.698 --> 01:16:51.428
Again, there can be an error,
right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15960-0
01:16:51.858 --> 01:16:53.418
An error occurs if the queue is
full.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15977-0
01:16:54.588 --> 01:16:58.701
If the queue itself is full,
then how can I still insert in

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15977-1
01:16:58.701 --> 01:16:59.798
the stack world?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/15982-0
01:16:59.808 --> 01:17:00.668
What is this error called?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16010-0
01:17:02.598 --> 01:17:07.582
Yeah, real quick theme edge
cases there also in stack there

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16010-1
01:17:07.582 --> 01:17:10.158
it is called as Stack Overflow.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16013-0
01:17:10.958 --> 01:17:11.618
Our stack full.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16019-0
01:17:12.878 --> 01:17:14.718
Here it is called Q full, yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16027-0
01:17:16.568 --> 01:17:18.338
Perfect, that is N queuing.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16050-0
01:17:18.528 --> 01:17:22.409
This is equal into your push
operation there and here DQ

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16050-1
01:17:22.409 --> 01:17:26.358
again for DQ, you don't have any
element given here. Why?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16062-0
01:17:28.568 --> 01:17:30.528
Yeah, queue also you can write
it using array.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16067-0
01:17:32.228 --> 01:17:32.438
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16069-0
01:17:32.448 --> 01:17:33.508
The underlying is, sorry.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16072-0
01:17:36.578 --> 01:17:37.048
Exactly.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16076-0
01:17:37.058 --> 01:17:37.728
Yeah, very good.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16096-0
01:17:37.738 --> 01:17:40.873
So I have not given any element
to remove because here also it

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16096-1
01:17:40.873 --> 01:17:42.118
follows a paradigm right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16125-0
01:17:42.128 --> 01:17:45.223
Only the first one, the first
element who went into the queue

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16125-1
01:17:45.223 --> 01:17:48.268
will be the first one to get out
or the one given by friend.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16134-0
01:17:48.618 --> 01:17:49.718
He will be the one to get out.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16143-0
01:17:50.618 --> 01:17:52.198
Yeah, AD stands for abstract
data type.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16147-0
01:17:53.398 --> 01:17:53.538
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16154-0
01:17:54.918 --> 01:17:56.788
So this very good question,
right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16159-0
01:17:56.798 --> 01:17:57.868
We did not touch upon that.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16175-0
01:17:58.118 --> 01:18:01.748
So your integer, your string,
your character, your array.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16214-0
01:18:01.918 --> 01:18:06.404
So these things are your basic
data types, which any language

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16214-1
01:18:06.404 --> 01:18:10.746
gives you correct you skew and
these type of things already

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16214-2
01:18:10.746 --> 01:18:15.015
there through the posing 3
programming is a queue directly

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16214-3
01:18:15.015 --> 01:18:16.318
available for you.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16223-0
01:18:18.718 --> 01:18:20.998
Yeah, MANISHA, don't really
right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16258-0
01:18:21.158 --> 01:18:24.278
It is just a concept, it it's a
concept which says that you know

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16258-1
01:18:24.278 --> 01:18:27.255
last one will come out first,
first one will 1st and all that

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16258-2
01:18:27.255 --> 01:18:28.168
we only four right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16331-0
01:18:28.738 --> 01:18:32.250
So these are called abstract
data types which you create

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16331-1
01:18:32.250 --> 01:18:35.885
using the other built-in data
types using your array using

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16331-2
01:18:35.885 --> 01:18:39.458
your linked list, you are
actually creating these type of

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16331-3
01:18:39.458 --> 01:18:43.402
abstract data types and you will
only expose the operations you

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16331-4
01:18:43.402 --> 01:18:47.283
will tell you can do Anqing you
can do dequeuing, you can know

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16331-5
01:18:47.283 --> 01:18:50.118
the front only these methods you
will expose.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16341-0
01:18:50.568 --> 01:18:52.898
They will not know the internal
working and all that.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16367-0
01:18:53.328 --> 01:18:56.328
Yeah, but in advanced
programming languages, they have

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16367-1
01:18:56.328 --> 01:18:59.602
made these available already,
like in your you know, Python

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16367-2
01:18:59.602 --> 01:19:00.148
And so on.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16371-0
01:19:00.158 --> 01:19:01.138
It's already available.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16376-0
01:19:01.268 --> 01:19:03.338
Yeah. And this?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16386-0
01:19:03.348 --> 01:19:04.248
Yes, is the name of it.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16401-0
01:19:05.108 --> 01:19:08.318
8 stands for abstract data type
which is queue in this example.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16413-0
01:19:08.708 --> 01:19:12.298
And yes, is the name of that
what does DQ do?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16425-0
01:19:12.308 --> 01:19:14.228
It removes the object from the
front of the queue.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16436-0
01:19:15.258 --> 01:19:17.308
Again, there can be a problem if
the queue is empty.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16442-0
01:19:17.318 --> 01:19:18.248
I cannot remove anything.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16446-0
01:19:19.208 --> 01:19:19.828
Yeah, that's right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16450-0
01:19:21.098 --> 01:19:21.768
What about friend?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16466-0
01:19:22.678 --> 01:19:25.428
Print is equivalent to which
method we learned in stack.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16473-0
01:19:27.248 --> 01:19:28.278
Anyone remember was there?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16477-0
01:19:28.658 --> 01:19:29.788
He will return an element.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16484-0
01:19:31.438 --> 01:19:32.308
Our top, very good.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16493-0
01:19:32.318 --> 01:19:34.048
He'll return the topmost element
there.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16506-0
01:19:34.198 --> 01:19:37.428
Here also it returns but does
not remove it, not remove it.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16522-0
01:19:37.438 --> 01:19:40.688
I'll just give you who is in the
front of the queue.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16542-0
01:19:41.368 --> 01:19:46.297
Basically, this friend gives you
the potential element will get

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16542-1
01:19:46.297 --> 01:19:49.378
removed when you invoke a DQ
operation.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16544-0
01:19:50.538 --> 01:19:50.968
Correct.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16548-0
01:19:51.118 --> 01:19:51.908
Cool here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16566-0
01:19:51.918 --> 01:19:54.338
Also, there can be an error if
the queue is empty, then there

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16566-1
01:19:54.338 --> 01:19:54.768
is nothing.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16572-0
01:19:54.778 --> 01:19:56.178
Then what will it return?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16578-0
01:19:56.188 --> 01:19:58.198
As for it, so these are the
methods.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16582-0
01:20:00.478 --> 01:20:01.008
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16590-0
01:20:01.058 --> 01:20:02.398
Is this clear case all of you?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16596-0
01:20:02.478 --> 01:20:03.398
What is the queue?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16604-0
01:20:03.408 --> 01:20:05.238
The example and the operations
that we can do.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16607-0
01:20:07.218 --> 01:20:07.398
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16612-0
01:20:08.518 --> 01:20:08.768
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16618-0
01:20:08.778 --> 01:20:09.678
It's in the hit list, correct?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16621-0
01:20:10.638 --> 01:20:10.998
What is?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16625-0
01:20:11.008 --> 01:20:11.248
Yes.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16651-0
01:20:11.258 --> 01:20:14.360
And O is just a variable name,
it can have any item, any

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16651-1
01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:17.408
variable or you know, I mean
it's just a variable name.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16663-0
01:20:17.958 --> 01:20:20.228
And yes, is the name of this
whole queue.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16668-0
01:20:20.298 --> 01:20:20.948
I have named it as.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16677-0
01:20:20.958 --> 01:20:22.618
Yes, you can name it as queue or
anything.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16680-0
01:20:23.658 --> 01:20:23.878
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16683-0
01:20:23.888 --> 01:20:24.208
Is that clear?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16685-0
01:20:25.808 --> 01:20:26.158
OK.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16701-0
01:20:27.998 --> 01:20:30.440
Well, let then let's you know
implement it just like the

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16701-1
01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:30.698
stack.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16711-0
01:20:30.768 --> 01:20:32.598
It's implemented using an array,
right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16731-0
01:20:33.148 --> 01:20:37.007
Create a queue using an array,
meaning you are going to specify

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16731-1
01:20:37.007 --> 01:20:39.238
a maximum size capital north,
right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16736-0
01:20:39.248 --> 01:20:39.798
Same thing.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16780-0
01:20:40.088 --> 01:20:44.462
The moment this line you have
it, can you think about some

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16780-1
01:20:44.462 --> 01:20:48.761
disadvantages of queue the
moment this line comes you are

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16780-2
01:20:48.761 --> 01:20:53.432
going to use an array to create
a queue, meaning you are going

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16780-3
01:20:53.432 --> 01:20:55.508
to put a capital N directly.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16791-0
01:20:55.518 --> 01:20:58.128
You know that there is a problem
of this limited size.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16799-0
01:20:58.138 --> 01:21:00.208
It cannot dynamically grow or
shrink.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16807-0
01:21:00.598 --> 01:21:02.848
That problem is already there,
right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16819-0
01:21:03.038 --> 01:21:05.948
The problem of array directly
comes as a problem of queues.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16821-0
01:21:05.958 --> 01:21:06.178
For now.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16827-0
01:21:07.238 --> 01:21:08.998
All right, let's proceed ahead.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16837-0
01:21:10.468 --> 01:21:12.558
The queue consists of an element
array, queue.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16848-0
01:21:12.608 --> 01:21:14.398
So previous example I had named
it yes.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16878-0
01:21:14.408 --> 01:21:18.116
Now I'm naming it as Q and two
integer variables because in

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16878-1
01:21:18.116 --> 01:21:21.578
stack you had only one guy
called tea which is the top.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16886-0
01:21:22.498 --> 01:21:24.338
But here I have two directions
right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16901-0
01:21:25.368 --> 01:21:27.530
I have to insert in One
Direction, remove in another

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16901-1
01:21:27.530 --> 01:21:27.938
direction.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16908-0
01:21:28.208 --> 01:21:28.848
So I need two.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16914-0
01:21:29.638 --> 01:21:32.248
So yeah, very, very important
definitions, guys.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16924-0
01:21:32.258 --> 01:21:33.988
Yeah, there is a very subtle
difference here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16932-0
01:21:34.378 --> 01:21:35.338
It's an open book exam.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16952-0
01:21:35.348 --> 01:21:39.004
You can of course look at it in
the final, but for Midsem and

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16952-1
01:21:39.004 --> 01:21:41.068
others, you'll have to be
focused.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/16959-0
01:21:41.578 --> 01:21:43.708
Yeah, look at the definition.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17032-0
01:21:43.718 --> 01:21:48.034
Yeah, yesterday the index of the
front element, which is the

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17032-1
01:21:48.034 --> 01:21:51.856
candidate to be removed by a
dequeue operation, it is

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17032-2
01:21:51.856 --> 01:21:56.102
pointing to that front element
itself, which is going to be

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17032-3
01:21:56.102 --> 01:22:00.490
deleted if you call the deque
operation are R is the index of

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17032-4
01:22:00.490 --> 01:22:04.948
the next available array cell,
meaning he's always pointing to

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17032-5
01:22:04.948 --> 01:22:09.478
an empty cell cell, which can be
used by the enqueue operation.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17038-0
01:22:10.638 --> 01:22:11.738
Did you get the difference,
guys?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17051-0
01:22:15.458 --> 01:22:19.428
Yeah, Rajesh, Krishna, all of
you Simran.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17068-0
01:22:21.968 --> 01:22:25.095
If will always point you to an
element which is already

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17068-1
01:22:25.095 --> 01:22:25.598
occupied.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17072-0
01:22:26.688 --> 01:22:27.378
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17076-0
01:22:27.548 --> 01:22:28.768
No, not just two indices.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17085-0
01:22:28.778 --> 01:22:30.878
Yuvraj, there is a very
important difference here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17117-0
01:22:30.948 --> 01:22:35.142
Look at this index of different
element, meaning he will always

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17117-1
01:22:35.142 --> 01:22:39.074
point to an element where you
know there is some data which

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17117-2
01:22:39.074 --> 01:22:40.058
can be removed.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17157-0
01:22:40.888 --> 01:22:44.248
Whereas R always points to the
index of the next available

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17157-1
01:22:44.248 --> 01:22:47.721
array cell, meaning he's going
to point to an empty location

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17157-2
01:22:47.721 --> 01:22:50.968
which will be used when you
perform a enqueue operation.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17164-0
01:22:52.188 --> 01:22:53.598
Getting it right, we will see
them.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17170-0
01:22:53.608 --> 01:22:53.898
Example.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17179-0
01:22:53.908 --> 01:22:56.598
It'll be more here in this
example.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17190-0
01:22:56.608 --> 01:22:59.758
Let's say F is pointing here and
R is pointing here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17202-0
01:22:59.768 --> 01:23:01.488
Here itself, the difference is
very clear, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17225-0
01:23:02.238 --> 01:23:05.404
Our is pointing to an empty
place, meaning when I do an

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17225-1
01:23:05.404 --> 01:23:07.948
enqueue operation, I want to
insert hundred.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17232-0
01:23:08.728 --> 01:23:10.578
I will put my unread here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17263-0
01:23:11.048 --> 01:23:14.671
I will take my R to the next
cell, meaning R will always

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17263-1
01:23:14.671 --> 01:23:18.868
point to an empty cell which can
be used by the insert operation.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17271-0
01:23:19.788 --> 01:23:20.798
And queue right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17304-0
01:23:20.948 --> 01:23:23.983
Whereas if this pointing to an
existing element that is,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17304-1
01:23:23.983 --> 01:23:27.285
whenever I want to do a dequeue
when I delete something, this

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17304-2
01:23:27.285 --> 01:23:30.428
will get deleted and if will go
point to the next element.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17307-0
01:23:32.838 --> 01:23:33.158
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17314-0
01:23:33.168 --> 01:23:34.148
Is this clear for all of you?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17335-0
01:23:36.408 --> 01:23:39.478
No, there is no such relations
or equal to F + 1 and so on.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17353-0
01:23:39.798 --> 01:23:42.918
Initially both of them start
here and once you start

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17353-1
01:23:42.918 --> 01:23:45.038
inserting, our alone keeps
growing.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17357-0
01:23:45.048 --> 01:23:46.238
F will still point there.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17370-0
01:23:47.518 --> 01:23:49.068
Let me take an example like
this.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17382-0
01:23:49.478 --> 01:23:51.548
You know, for the time being,
just, you know, ignore all this.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17389-0
01:23:51.558 --> 01:23:52.628
Let's take this example.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17406-0
01:23:53.218 --> 01:23:57.998
Initially both of them are F and
are both of them are pointing to

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17406-1
01:23:57.998 --> 01:23:58.868
0 here yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17420-0
01:24:00.848 --> 01:24:03.168
Yeah, because we had already
deleted some example.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17436-0
01:24:03.208 --> 01:24:06.998
We had deleted all these cells,
so if I had come here, what?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17446-0
01:24:07.358 --> 01:24:08.508
But now let's see this example.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17451-0
01:24:09.618 --> 01:24:11.968
I'm inserting an element 100.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17465-0
01:24:13.998 --> 01:24:16.238
You will tell me where we'll FB
where will R be.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17476-0
01:24:18.198 --> 01:24:19.488
Just go by their definition.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17498-0
01:24:20.178 --> 01:24:22.980
If will point to the element
which is the first one to get

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17498-1
01:24:22.980 --> 01:24:25.308
deleted, whereas R will point to
the empty cell.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17501-0
01:24:26.268 --> 01:24:26.758
Very good.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17516-0
01:24:26.908 --> 01:24:30.168
Yeah, will remain at 0, whereas
R will go to the next position.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17526-0
01:24:31.528 --> 01:24:34.748
Well, I'm inserting another
element 200.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17541-0
01:24:36.658 --> 01:24:39.238
Where will you FB where will R
be in indexes?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17545-0
01:24:39.248 --> 01:24:39.718
You will tell me.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17550-0
01:24:42.278 --> 01:24:42.848
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17571-0
01:24:42.918 --> 01:24:45.499
Yeah, we'll still remain at zero
because I have not deleted

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17571-1
01:24:45.499 --> 01:24:47.048
anything, whereas R will go to
two.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17574-0
01:24:50.188 --> 01:24:50.328
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17589-0
01:24:51.748 --> 01:24:55.408
Or we'll go to two while insert
300 here date.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17608-0
01:24:57.458 --> 01:25:00.938
I want to insert another element
so R will not point to this.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17613-0
01:25:02.548 --> 01:25:03.458
Are will go to three.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17629-0
01:25:03.768 --> 01:25:07.949
I'll insert that element right
and R would have gone to four

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17629-1
01:25:07.949 --> 01:25:08.498
already.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17642-0
01:25:10.008 --> 01:25:12.228
At this stage I am now so far so
good.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17644-0
01:25:12.238 --> 01:25:12.558
All of you?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17652-0
01:25:13.388 --> 01:25:15.678
No, initially all are at zero,
yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17660-0
01:25:18.318 --> 01:25:19.258
So far so good, all of you.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17676-0
01:25:21.678 --> 01:25:23.868
If stays at zero or keeps
increasing and wins it.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17679-0
01:25:23.878 --> 01:25:24.288
OK, cool.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17684-0
01:25:24.298 --> 01:25:25.088
Now let's delete.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17692-0
01:25:25.148 --> 01:25:26.508
Now I want to delete an element.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17705-0
01:25:26.958 --> 01:25:30.344
You will tell me which element
will get deleted which actual

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17705-1
01:25:30.344 --> 01:25:30.788
element.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17710-0
01:25:34.168 --> 01:25:34.858
Yeah, very good.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17715-0
01:25:34.868 --> 01:25:35.858
100 will get deleted.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17722-0
01:25:35.918 --> 01:25:36.928
Yeah, that's absolutely right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17728-0
01:25:37.788 --> 01:25:38.418
I'll go ahead.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17744-0
01:25:38.788 --> 01:25:43.788
I'll delete this under it right
and now where Will F point?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17754-0
01:25:45.198 --> 01:25:47.218
Every little it where is the F
going to fine now?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17757-0
01:25:49.908 --> 01:25:50.248
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17766-0
01:25:50.258 --> 01:25:51.498
Yeah, becomes one very good.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17772-0
01:25:52.428 --> 01:25:54.118
F is pointing to 200 now.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17794-0
01:25:56.538 --> 01:26:01.186
I want to again delete 200 also
where will if go I want to

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17794-1
01:26:01.186 --> 01:26:02.998
delete my 200 also now.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17802-0
01:26:06.588 --> 01:26:08.128
Right, this is my current state
here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17812-0
01:26:12.158 --> 01:26:13.288
You want it got deleted?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17834-0
01:26:13.918 --> 01:26:18.775
F is always going to point to me
print element so 200 got deleted

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17834-1
01:26:18.775 --> 01:26:21.278
and where will F point now?
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17874-0
01:26:23.468 --> 01:26:28.057
If will point it the second
pollution, which is 300, this

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17874-1
01:26:28.057 --> 01:26:33.041
concept is it clear guys always
if is going to point me to the

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17874-2
01:26:33.041 --> 01:26:36.998
potential first element who can
be deleted right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17885-0
01:26:38.418 --> 01:26:40.268
OK, now let's see something
interesting with this.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17893-0
01:26:41.118 --> 01:26:44.078
I want to insert another
element. Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17920-0
01:26:44.248 --> 01:26:51.221
How do we deal insert, insert, I
increment RI, insert, increment,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17920-1
01:26:51.221 --> 01:26:53.968
RI, insert, I increment R.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17923-0
01:26:54.518 --> 01:26:55.548
So what happened to R now?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17925-0
01:26:58.268 --> 01:26:58.448
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17932-0
01:27:01.308 --> 01:27:02.158
What happened to R?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17938-0
01:27:02.678 --> 01:27:04.098
It's already filled.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17943-0
01:27:04.948 --> 01:27:05.908
What error will I throw?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17976-0
01:27:10.578 --> 01:27:14.564
I put an error that you know
what I've already inserted till

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17976-1
01:27:14.564 --> 01:27:18.812
700 and now I don't have anymore
too, you know, accommodate you?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17976-2
01:27:18.812 --> 01:27:19.008
No.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17988-0
01:27:20.928 --> 01:27:22.218
Is that you're really full.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17991-0
01:27:23.708 --> 01:27:24.258
Think about it.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/17998-0
01:27:27.328 --> 01:27:28.138
Summit was right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18013-0
01:27:28.528 --> 01:27:33.412
All of you think about it, and
let's assume I'm also deleting

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18013-1
01:27:33.412 --> 01:27:33.728
300.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18019-0
01:27:33.738 --> 01:27:34.828
I'm also deleting 400.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18025-0
01:27:34.838 --> 01:27:35.858
I'm also deleting 500.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18049-0
01:27:35.868 --> 01:27:40.548
I'm also deleting 600, so at
this stage where is my F

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18049-1
01:27:40.548 --> 01:27:44.188
pointing to our was already out
of bound.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18061-0
01:27:44.198 --> 01:27:48.348
You throw an error and where is
pointing now 700.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18071-0
01:27:50.128 --> 01:27:54.558
Meaning, actually speaking, all
these cells are empty.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18084-0
01:27:57.258 --> 01:28:00.788
But still you complained that
queue is full, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18127-0
01:28:01.568 --> 01:28:05.466
But this is a problem with
normal cube that is, even though

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18127-1
01:28:05.466 --> 01:28:09.040
there are empty space in the
beginning, if you hit the

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18127-2
01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:13.263
threshold you will complain that
the queue is full when actually

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18127-3
01:28:13.263 --> 01:28:14.238
it is not full.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18135-0
01:28:14.248 --> 01:28:16.928
There might be empty slots in
the beginning, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18143-0
01:28:17.868 --> 01:28:18.698
That is, what is it?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18173-0
01:28:18.708 --> 01:28:21.920
Vantage repeatedly in queuing
and dequeuing the single element

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18173-1
01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:24.878
10 times will make this happen
where Fr all of them start

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18173-2
01:28:24.878 --> 01:28:26.408
pointing to that last element.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18215-0
01:28:27.298 --> 01:28:31.182
No more elements can be added to
the queue, though there is space

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18215-1
01:28:31.182 --> 01:28:34.891
in the queue, right though there
is space, all these cells are

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18215-2
01:28:34.891 --> 01:28:38.658
empty, but still since R reached
here, you are complaining that

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18215-3
01:28:38.658 --> 01:28:39.718
he is full, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18224-0
01:28:39.848 --> 01:28:43.088
So what is the solution for
this? Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18233-0
01:28:45.198 --> 01:28:46.008
What is the solution?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18237-0
01:28:46.018 --> 01:28:46.578
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18242-0
01:28:46.638 --> 01:28:47.468
What can we think about?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18249-0
01:28:48.978 --> 01:28:50.708
Will values not be transferred
from zero?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18255-0
01:28:51.298 --> 01:28:52.028
Will be transferred?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18265-0
01:28:52.038 --> 01:28:53.568
Yeah, they'll all be in the same
place.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18282-0
01:28:53.578 --> 01:28:58.992
Only you should not transfer
explicitly doing all that but

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18282-1
01:28:58.992 --> 01:28:59.818
circular.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18303-0
01:28:59.828 --> 01:29:03.024
Can we imagine right if I hit
this last threshold, I will go

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18303-1
01:29:03.024 --> 01:29:04.858
back and check the first
position.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18319-0
01:29:05.408 --> 01:29:08.328
If these are all also, you know
filled, then I will claim that

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18319-1
01:29:08.328 --> 01:29:08.838
it is full.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18326-0
01:29:09.108 --> 01:29:11.088
Otherwise I can use this place
right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18340-0
01:29:14.888 --> 01:29:17.178
Yeah, this implementation isn't
fully utilizing.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18345-0
01:29:17.188 --> 01:29:18.038
The space is allocated.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18355-0
01:29:18.048 --> 01:29:20.178
However, if we implement
reordering arrange front, yes.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18368-0
01:29:20.328 --> 01:29:22.844
But if you implement the other
way, that is called a circular

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18368-1
01:29:22.844 --> 01:29:23.088
queue.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18371-0
01:29:24.068 --> 01:29:24.658
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18378-0
01:29:24.748 --> 01:29:25.948
So this is a normal queue.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18387-0
01:29:26.558 --> 01:29:29.088
The normal queue has this
problem, yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18399-0
01:29:29.098 --> 01:29:31.508
If you use normal queue, this
problem will happen.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18414-0
01:29:31.898 --> 01:29:34.468
So we will go for something
called as a circular queue.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18435-0
01:29:35.178 --> 01:29:38.134
Circular queues are one where
from the last you are again

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18435-1
01:29:38.134 --> 01:29:39.868
joining it back to the first
one.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18448-0
01:29:40.158 --> 01:29:42.148
After this you are again join it
to the first one.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18459-0
01:29:42.698 --> 01:29:47.158
It looks something like this
lake parent is here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18479-0
01:29:47.218 --> 01:29:50.423
Then you have kept on inserting
items and then you know you'll

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18479-1
01:29:50.423 --> 01:29:51.238
after the seven.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18500-0
01:29:51.248 --> 01:29:54.631
You'll again go back to the
zeroth position, and if this was

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18500-1
01:29:54.631 --> 01:29:57.128
empty then you could have
utilized it right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18505-0
01:29:58.588 --> 01:29:59.298
Is it clear, guys?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18530-0
01:29:59.308 --> 01:30:02.226
It's also called as a wrapped
around configuration where the

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18530-1
01:30:02.226 --> 01:30:05.288
last one and the first one are
wrapped around something to form

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18530-2
01:30:05.288 --> 01:30:05.958
like a circle.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18541-0
01:30:08.068 --> 01:30:10.138
But now there is another point.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18561-0
01:30:10.148 --> 01:30:13.202
So for front and rear, we were
just doing rare plus plus or

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18561-1
01:30:13.202 --> 01:30:14.068
friend plus plus.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18571-0
01:30:14.928 --> 01:30:17.518
But here when I have a circle,
will that still work?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18578-0
01:30:19.128 --> 01:30:21.338
Yeah, after seven.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18588-0
01:30:21.348 --> 01:30:23.308
So for example, here rare is
pointing to five.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18593-0
01:30:23.588 --> 01:30:24.678
I add another element.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18598-0
01:30:24.748 --> 01:30:25.878
I add another element.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18607-0
01:30:25.948 --> 01:30:28.618
I add a another element from 7.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18624-0
01:30:28.628 --> 01:30:31.439
If I do another increment, it
will go to eat, it'll go to 9

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18624-1
01:30:31.439 --> 01:30:31.908
and so on.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18636-0
01:30:32.728 --> 01:30:35.178
But I wanted to come back to the
front location.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18642-0
01:30:35.768 --> 01:30:36.778
So who will help us?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18645-0
01:30:37.368 --> 01:30:37.838
Very good.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18682-0
01:30:37.848 --> 01:30:42.382
Yeah, the mod operation will
help us if you do modulus

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18682-1
01:30:42.382 --> 01:30:47.411
operation, then after the seven
if you do 7 + 1 module is 8,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18682-2
01:30:47.411 --> 01:30:48.978
it'll become eight.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18709-0
01:30:48.988 --> 01:30:51.991
Model is 8 which is 0, so you'll
again come back to the first

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18709-1
01:30:51.991 --> 01:30:54.849
location and you will keep
rotating inside this particular

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18709-2
01:30:54.849 --> 01:30:55.188
circle.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18711-0
01:30:56.638 --> 01:30:56.888
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18719-0
01:30:56.898 --> 01:30:58.118
Is this clear guys for all of
you?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18744-0
01:31:00.198 --> 01:31:04.029
That's why we are doing or equal
to R + 1 mod N if equal to F + 1

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18744-1
01:31:04.029 --> 01:31:04.378
mod N.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18776-0
01:31:07.128 --> 01:31:10.876
All of you the exact same thing,
unless all of them got get

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18776-1
01:31:10.876 --> 01:31:14.188
occupied, there will not be any,
you know, problems.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18787-0
01:31:15.548 --> 01:31:19.198
But now when Ari is full, for
example, here I put.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18797-0
01:31:23.078 --> 01:31:24.958
And now, rare also has come
here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18814-0
01:31:26.348 --> 01:31:30.108
So no friend and rare both of
them are in the zeroth place.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18826-0
01:31:32.078 --> 01:31:34.188
Is the Q full or Q empty now?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18839-0
01:31:36.728 --> 01:31:38.448
Yeah, Vijay got it's a very
simple concept.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18851-0
01:31:38.608 --> 01:31:41.948
Since we have a queue, can I
have indexes going above 7 here?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18893-0
01:31:44.888 --> 01:31:48.509
When it is a normal thing like
this, I can keep incrementing

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18893-1
01:31:48.509 --> 01:31:52.131
and here I can claim that it is
out of bound, but when it is

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18893-2
01:31:52.131 --> 01:31:54.388
circular I wanted to go back to
zero.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18900-0
01:31:54.618 --> 01:31:55.898
And how will I make it to go
back?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18912-0
01:31:56.788 --> 01:31:58.178
That is where I use the mod
operation.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18927-0
01:31:58.948 --> 01:32:04.243
If I do a modulus operation, I
will again be back to this zero

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18927-1
01:32:04.243 --> 01:32:05.588
position, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18948-0
01:32:05.598 --> 01:32:08.790
That is why we are using the
modulus and now I had another

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18948-1
01:32:08.790 --> 01:32:09.548
question here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18957-0
01:32:09.828 --> 01:32:11.758
When will I know the queue is
full or empty?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18977-0
01:32:12.198 --> 01:32:15.448
Those initially, we told the
definition that a front and rare

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18977-1
01:32:15.448 --> 01:32:16.078
are at zero.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/18983-0
01:32:16.608 --> 01:32:17.908
It means that is empty.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19007-0
01:32:21.118 --> 01:32:24.746
So here, front and rear, both of
them are in 0, but now is the

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19007-1
01:32:24.746 --> 01:32:25.898
queue full or empty?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19041-0
01:32:28.378 --> 01:32:32.172
Right when arrays full F is
equal to R, same as empty

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19041-1
01:32:32.172 --> 01:32:36.388
condition then how do we know if
it is a queue full or QMT?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19049-0
01:32:36.918 --> 01:32:38.748
There are many ways to handle
this actually.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19057-0
01:32:38.818 --> 01:32:41.168
Yeah, you can actually do.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19092-0
01:32:41.178 --> 01:32:45.189
If rare is, you know, front or
equal to 0 and condition and if

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19092-1
01:32:45.189 --> 01:32:49.264
this element is not empty then
you can know that it is actually

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19092-2
01:32:49.264 --> 01:32:51.748
not having values something like
that.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19101-0
01:32:52.938 --> 01:32:54.228
There are many ways to approach
it.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19108-0
01:32:54.958 --> 01:32:56.068
A simple approach is to handle.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19123-0
01:32:56.078 --> 01:32:59.302
This is to insist the queue can
never hold more than North minus

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19123-1
01:32:59.302 --> 01:32:59.848
one object.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19133-0
01:33:00.278 --> 01:33:02.008
Unfortunately, this is the
textbook way.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19138-0
01:33:02.318 --> 01:33:03.848
Yeah, very pathetic way.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19140-0
01:33:03.898 --> 01:33:04.428
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19162-0
01:33:04.538 --> 01:33:08.205
So they are not wanting you to
put more than you know the six

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19162-1
01:33:08.205 --> 01:33:08.738
elements.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19167-0
01:33:09.018 --> 01:33:10.218
The cell will always be empty.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19169-0
01:33:11.748 --> 01:33:11.888
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19184-0
01:33:13.288 --> 01:33:16.144
So and they have of course
explained it for you to try it

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19184-1
01:33:16.144 --> 01:33:16.588
later on.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19199-0
01:33:16.598 --> 01:33:19.760
You know how to handle this
condition and all that, but is

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19199-1
01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:20.618
this clear guys?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19203-0
01:33:24.448 --> 01:33:24.698
Yes.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19208-0
01:33:24.708 --> 01:33:24.788
No.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19223-0
01:33:25.578 --> 01:33:28.757
If you want to know if it is
full or empty, it is not very

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19223-1
01:33:28.757 --> 01:33:29.188
trivial.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19264-0
01:33:29.518 --> 01:33:33.353
You might have to do some extra
check, meaning you'll have to

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19264-1
01:33:33.353 --> 01:33:37.312
check that if rent and Ray are
both 0, or if they're equal, and

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19264-2
01:33:37.312 --> 01:33:39.168
if that cells have some value.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19289-0
01:33:39.178 --> 01:33:43.007
If it is not equal to well, then
you can know that that is not

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19289-1
01:33:43.007 --> 01:33:46.168
empty, and if it is null it
means that it is empty.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19291-0
01:33:48.158 --> 01:33:48.328
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19297-0
01:33:50.398 --> 01:33:51.678
Similar examples, yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19308-0
01:33:53.738 --> 01:33:55.058
How will you know the size of
something?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19319-0
01:33:56.818 --> 01:34:00.848
You should do the capital N
minus front plus, Sir, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19328-0
01:34:00.858 --> 01:34:02.968
Because you could have also
deleted some elements, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19343-0
01:34:03.298 --> 01:34:06.708
So you should do A minus front
plus R again.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19363-0
01:34:06.718 --> 01:34:10.673
Of course, model is so in Q it
is mandatory to move null once

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19363-1
01:34:10.673 --> 01:34:11.758
we read the data.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19370-0
01:34:11.768 --> 01:34:13.758
Yes, that's a better practice,
correct?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19379-0
01:34:13.808 --> 01:34:15.258
Otherwise you will get misled
right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19386-0
01:34:15.268 --> 01:34:17.518
Some other old number will be
there, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19392-0
01:34:17.528 --> 01:34:18.228
So you should not do that.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19406-0
01:34:20.328 --> 01:34:23.038
If are equally equal to F and
exactly that's right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19412-0
01:34:24.768 --> 01:34:25.498
What if it is empty?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19423-0
01:34:26.638 --> 01:34:28.588
Yeah, this is the textbook way
of doing.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19434-0
01:34:28.598 --> 01:34:31.468
Again, this is a little, you
know, controversial, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19447-0
01:34:32.518 --> 01:34:34.118
If you use the textbook way,
this will work.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19468-0
01:34:34.128 --> 01:34:36.875
Otherwise this equal to R can
give problem and what your

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19468-1
01:34:36.875 --> 01:34:38.948
friend just suggested is the
right answer.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19473-0
01:34:39.728 --> 01:34:41.438
Yeah, CHARAN told you, right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19488-0
01:34:43.568 --> 01:34:46.918
If equal to R and if that
element is not null.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19492-0
01:34:49.958 --> 01:34:50.208
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19502-0
01:34:50.218 --> 01:34:51.208
Is it clear, guys, all of you?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19520-0
01:34:52.158 --> 01:34:55.232
Of course I will give you the
notebook which is having the

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19520-1
01:34:55.232 --> 01:34:57.838
right implementation, not the
textbook way, yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19533-0
01:34:59.638 --> 01:35:01.948
Print element if it is empty
then throw an error.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19565-0
01:35:02.358 --> 01:35:05.486
Otherwise, give the front
element queue of F like you you

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19565-1
01:35:05.486 --> 01:35:08.937
don't give any input because you
know that the front element is

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19565-2
01:35:08.937 --> 01:35:10.448
the one who will be deleted.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19580-0
01:35:11.518 --> 01:35:14.408
You check for error if there is
elements you can delete him.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19603-0
01:35:14.638 --> 01:35:17.274
Similar to stack, you take that
element and keep it in a

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19603-1
01:35:17.274 --> 01:35:19.818
variable so that you can tell
that was the guy who got

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19603-2
01:35:19.818 --> 01:35:20.188
deleted.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19625-0
01:35:21.148 --> 01:35:24.908
Otherwise make it null and do
front equal to friend plus plus,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19625-1
01:35:24.908 --> 01:35:26.998
but you cannot just do front
plus.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19649-0
01:35:27.008 --> 01:35:30.526
Plus, because there is a
circular queue, so you need to

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19649-1
01:35:30.526 --> 01:35:34.108
use mod N similarly for MQ you
need an insert operation.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19667-0
01:35:34.118 --> 01:35:37.251
You need what is to be inserted,
but you have to check for the

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19667-1
01:35:37.251 --> 01:35:37.998
edge condition.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19682-0
01:35:38.158 --> 01:35:41.313
There might be cases that the
queue is full, so you check for

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19682-1
01:35:41.313 --> 01:35:41.568
that.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19715-0
01:35:42.078 --> 01:35:46.199
You put error, otherwise you can
insert you do in that R position

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19715-1
01:35:46.199 --> 01:35:50.258
you insert your item and you do
R Plus plus, but you cannot just

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19715-2
01:35:50.258 --> 01:35:51.258
do plain R Plus.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19728-0
01:35:51.268 --> 01:35:54.429
Plus, because it is circular
queue, so you are doing R Plus

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19728-1
01:35:54.429 --> 01:35:55.378
plus modules here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19731-0
01:35:59.058 --> 01:35:59.358
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19741-0
01:35:59.368 --> 01:36:00.998
No, you will just use circular
form Vijay.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19745-0
01:36:01.008 --> 01:36:01.418
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19778-0
01:36:01.488 --> 01:36:04.420
We will not go for that because
it has a major problem, right,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19778-1
01:36:04.420 --> 01:36:07.166
even if it has empty spaces, we
have still complain that I

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19778-2
01:36:07.166 --> 01:36:07.818
cannot insert.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19792-0
01:36:08.088 --> 01:36:11.252
So whenever we are talking about
queue, we will actually use the

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19792-1
01:36:11.252 --> 01:36:12.178
circular form only.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19817-0
01:36:12.628 --> 01:36:17.041
Yeah, unless it's explicitly
told to you, it is understood

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19817-1
01:36:17.041 --> 01:36:20.558
that we will use the circular
form only. Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19834-0
01:36:20.678 --> 01:36:24.828
Sai is equal to n -, R which
line this this one you mean?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19841-0
01:36:24.838 --> 01:36:27.898
OK, it's all very trivial guys.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19847-0
01:36:27.908 --> 01:36:29.718
Yeah, don't get confused.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19852-0
01:36:30.188 --> 01:36:30.748
There is a queue.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19864-0
01:36:31.998 --> 01:36:32.728
It's app around.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19875-0
01:36:34.568 --> 01:36:38.338
I put some elements, I've
deleted them now.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19887-0
01:36:39.068 --> 01:36:42.648
Now my first pointing here and
may R is pointing here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19905-0
01:36:42.758 --> 01:36:47.198
So how do we get the total size
right from the total capital?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19930-0
01:36:47.208 --> 01:36:51.420
North, I must subtract my
because I deleted these parts

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19930-1
01:36:51.420 --> 01:36:55.708
and then I should add my this R
that will give my. Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19933-0
01:36:55.718 --> 01:36:56.018
Is it clear?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19936-0
01:36:58.998 --> 01:36:59.328
Yes.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19962-0
01:36:59.338 --> 01:37:03.297
No, maybe, but yeah, I will
recommend you to take an actual,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19962-1
01:37:03.297 --> 01:37:06.998
you know queue, put the indices
in trace these programs.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19964-0
01:37:07.008 --> 01:37:07.468
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19969-0
01:37:07.658 --> 01:37:08.668
So something like you know?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19980-0
01:37:10.838 --> 01:37:14.388
Take a cue like this and
actually put some numbers.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19986-0
01:37:16.888 --> 01:37:17.968
Give them index values.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/19989-0
01:37:20.868 --> 01:37:21.198
Right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20003-0
01:37:21.588 --> 01:37:24.838
And then try to go ahead and
trace each of the lines.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20014-0
01:37:24.848 --> 01:37:26.438
Then you will be able to get a
better picture.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20022-0
01:37:27.488 --> 01:37:28.318
Yeah, there's the end.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20034-0
01:37:28.328 --> 01:37:31.478
Is your capacity F is your
friend, or is your rare?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20058-0
01:37:32.188 --> 01:37:35.702
Since there are options that you
have inserted something and then

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20058-1
01:37:35.702 --> 01:37:38.578
deleted them, so you need to
account for that F also.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20066-0
01:37:38.848 --> 01:37:40.968
That is why there is a minus CF
plus R.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20076-0
01:37:42.768 --> 01:37:45.538
Yeah, his empty,
straightforward.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20109-0
01:37:45.548 --> 01:37:50.195
We already discussed both of
them are same and if that

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20109-1
01:37:50.195 --> 01:37:55.687
element also if that queue of F
is equally equal to null then it

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20109-2
01:37:55.687 --> 01:37:57.208
means it is empty.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20121-0
01:37:59.268 --> 01:38:00.978
But R will point to MD place.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20129-0
01:38:00.988 --> 01:38:02.278
Uh, how can we directly?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20141-0
01:38:02.598 --> 01:38:04.698
R will not point to an empty
place, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20150-0
01:38:05.288 --> 01:38:08.338
R location is empty, but R will
still point.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20167-0
01:38:08.348 --> 01:38:12.198
For example, in this case R will
.23 that is not empty, correct?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20173-0
01:38:14.178 --> 01:38:14.908
Are you getting it?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20192-0
01:38:15.318 --> 01:38:19.480
Q of R is empty that is not
having anything here, but R is

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20192-1
01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:21.668
still pointing to three, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20200-0
01:38:22.818 --> 01:38:24.578
So I should be calculating
something like that.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20204-0
01:38:26.838 --> 01:38:27.218
Yes. No.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20222-0
01:38:31.788 --> 01:38:35.823
Yeah, for the circular example
will give size as seven, but we

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20222-1
01:38:35.823 --> 01:38:37.168
should have, uh, six.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20227-0
01:38:38.098 --> 01:38:38.888
No, not really.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20246-0
01:38:38.898 --> 01:38:42.752
So we are talking about size
guys, not capital N so for this

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20246-1
01:38:42.752 --> 01:38:44.458
example, what is capital N?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20256-0
01:38:46.638 --> 01:38:48.628
Yeah, calculation is based on
indices, of course.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20277-0
01:38:48.638 --> 01:38:52.492
Yeah, the whole example revolves
around indices, not the actual,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20277-1
01:38:52.492 --> 01:38:53.738
you know, value here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20285-0
01:38:53.748 --> 01:38:56.308
Capital N is 6, where is F even
now?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20309-0
01:39:00.408 --> 01:39:05.582
If I have not deleted anything,
so if I still pointing me to 0,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20309-1
01:39:05.582 --> 01:39:06.068
great.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20334-0
01:39:08.058 --> 01:39:12.200
If we're still pointing to zero
and where is our pointing to, R

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20334-1
01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:15.308
is pointing to three here right
to the Mt slot.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20341-0
01:39:16.188 --> 01:39:17.358
So what did the formula say?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20358-0
01:39:17.368 --> 01:39:23.458
Formula told 6 -, 3 +, 0, that
is 6 -, 3 which is 3.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20373-0
01:39:23.528 --> 01:39:26.798
That is my size, so here there
is 123 elements.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20375-0
01:39:27.108 --> 01:39:28.138
So my formalize correct?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20378-0
01:39:30.008 --> 01:39:30.378
Right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20387-0
01:39:30.908 --> 01:39:32.878
What if I had deleted this
hundred?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20415-0
01:39:32.948 --> 01:39:38.218
If this F was pointing to one
right, then this F will be one,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20415-1
01:39:38.218 --> 01:39:41.278
so this will become 3 + 1 four 6
-.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20420-0
01:39:41.288 --> 01:39:42.298
Four will become two.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20434-0
01:39:42.598 --> 01:39:44.978
That is my size which is this
300 and 200.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20438-0
01:39:45.468 --> 01:39:46.338
You get the point, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20454-0
01:39:46.348 --> 01:39:50.388
All of you, we have to account
for that F correct.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20478-0
01:39:50.398 --> 01:39:53.118
Otherwise, you know, if you keep
deleting in the beginning only

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20478-1
01:39:53.118 --> 01:39:55.328
our if you have in the formula
you will get misled.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20494-0
01:39:55.858 --> 01:39:59.044
That is why we had all that so
size is including the empty

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20494-1
01:39:59.044 --> 01:39:59.368
place.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20496-0
01:39:59.378 --> 01:39:59.478
No.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20520-0
01:40:00.418 --> 01:40:02.789
Yeah, you have to take the R
value, but once you apply the

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20520-1
01:40:02.789 --> 01:40:04.438
formula you will get the correct
answer.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20523-0
01:40:05.378 --> 01:40:05.818
Hello again.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20535-0
01:40:05.828 --> 01:40:08.728
Urge Krishna, please take the
you know examples and trace it.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20543-0
01:40:09.858 --> 01:40:11.458
Yeah, and only if you trace it.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20568-0
01:40:11.468 --> 01:40:14.666
You will get it as a better
picture, but you were right, we

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20568-1
01:40:14.666 --> 01:40:17.651
should have taken the actual,
you know, let's take this

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20568-2
01:40:17.651 --> 01:40:18.078
example.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20581-0
01:40:20.388 --> 01:40:21.788
You will tell me where is F?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20587-0
01:40:21.928 --> 01:40:23.188
You'll tell me where is R?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20591-0
01:40:24.838 --> 01:40:25.508
Yeah, real quick.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20610-0
01:40:25.518 --> 01:40:29.050
Yeah, we're losing time on, you
know, very, very trivial things

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20610-1
01:40:29.050 --> 01:40:29.658
real quick.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20621-0
01:40:29.668 --> 01:40:32.558
Where is F0, where is R?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20625-0
01:40:33.528 --> 01:40:34.458
It is not four.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20628-0
01:40:34.518 --> 01:40:34.638
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20634-0
01:40:36.318 --> 01:40:37.718
Again, someone told four no.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20650-0
01:40:38.778 --> 01:40:42.294
Yeah, it is pointing to the
empty location which is 5,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20650-1
01:40:42.294 --> 01:40:42.678
right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20655-0
01:40:42.898 --> 01:40:44.058
What is capital N here?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20678-0
01:40:47.388 --> 01:40:53.038
Capital N is how many slots are
there 12345678 right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20699-0
01:40:53.048 --> 01:41:02.139
Capital N is 8 correct, though
formula ways 8 -, 0 + 5, that is

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20699-1
01:41:02.139 --> 01:41:04.128
8 -, 5, right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20701-0
01:41:05.668 --> 01:41:06.008
Yes, no.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20709-0
01:41:08.588 --> 01:41:09.488
So what is the answer we got?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20711-0
01:41:12.058 --> 01:41:12.248
3.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20715-0
01:41:14.708 --> 01:41:15.528
Why 7 frame?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20717-0
01:41:17.558 --> 01:41:17.928
Right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20731-0
01:41:18.318 --> 01:41:20.733
Can you please explain with an
example how mod calculation is

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20731-1
01:41:20.733 --> 01:41:20.928
done?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20734-0
01:41:21.258 --> 01:41:21.858
Come on, guys.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20745-0
01:41:21.868 --> 01:41:23.968
Yeah, we are doing master
scores, right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20772-0
01:41:24.818 --> 01:41:29.380
This is 8 if it is having three
to divide it by three and then

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20772-1
01:41:29.380 --> 01:41:31.988
three tools are is 6 and
remainder.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20777-0
01:41:32.038 --> 01:41:33.608
This is your model is sensor.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20788-0
01:41:33.978 --> 01:41:38.893
Yeah, the remainder answer is
your total answer, correct, yes,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20788-1
01:41:38.893 --> 01:41:39.128
no.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20790-0
01:41:43.118 --> 01:41:43.298
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20801-0
01:41:45.038 --> 01:41:48.818
So n -, F + R, right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20805-0
01:41:49.828 --> 01:41:50.578
So what did we do?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20818-0
01:41:50.648 --> 01:41:55.848
This is my capital N minus my F
+ R right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20825-0
01:41:56.078 --> 01:41:57.368
So my R was here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20853-0
01:41:57.838 --> 01:42:02.439
It is pointing me to five and my
capital N is nothing but eight

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20853-1
01:42:02.439 --> 01:42:05.818
and my friend is still pointing
me to 0 right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20858-0
01:42:05.828 --> 01:42:07.748
So this is what we got, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20875-0
01:42:09.598 --> 01:42:14.247
So this was my three right but
here how many elements are

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20875-1
01:42:14.247 --> 01:42:14.728
there?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20881-0
01:42:14.738 --> 01:42:15.678
What is the size here?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20888-0
01:42:15.728 --> 01:42:17.018
Is it 3 or is it 5?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20890-0
01:42:18.988 --> 01:42:19.148
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20896-0
01:42:23.128 --> 01:42:23.308
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20903-0
01:42:24.288 --> 01:42:26.218
You mean this capital N -?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20926-0
01:42:26.228 --> 01:42:31.072
F + R someone told that yeah,
even if you do that, F + R is

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20926-1
01:42:31.072 --> 01:42:32.768
nothing but five 8 -.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20934-0
01:42:32.778 --> 01:42:34.598
Five is 3 only, but here you
have wrong rate.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20944-0
01:42:36.628 --> 01:42:38.988
So is this formula correct or
wrong? Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20947-0
01:42:42.328 --> 01:42:42.638
Yes.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20949-0
01:42:42.648 --> 01:42:43.018
No, maybe.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20966-0
01:42:46.558 --> 01:42:52.498
Yeah, n -, F, less R and then
you also have something here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20970-0
01:42:52.908 --> 01:42:53.608
What is this part?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/20981-0
01:42:56.058 --> 01:43:00.788
Right, it is modulus N again
right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21012-0
01:43:03.238 --> 01:43:06.537
Yeah, so please try to do this
and also I will upload a

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21012-1
01:43:06.537 --> 01:43:10.368
notebook as I told your textbook
way of queue is a little wrong.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21048-0
01:43:10.378 --> 01:43:12.755
Yeah, it is a little wrong
because they go with some

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21048-1
01:43:12.755 --> 01:43:15.492
assumptions that you know you
should not allow more than you

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21048-2
01:43:15.492 --> 01:43:18.408
know and minus one object and so
on, which is not the right way.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21058-0
01:43:18.728 --> 01:43:20.648
So then you will get the right
thing, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21063-0
01:43:20.958 --> 01:43:21.828
So do practice this.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21078-0
01:43:21.838 --> 01:43:24.108
I will also upload the notebook
which will have the right one.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21085-0
01:43:24.478 --> 01:43:25.758
Yeah, don't get confused with
this.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21088-0
01:43:27.048 --> 01:43:27.278
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21095-0
01:43:27.288 --> 01:43:28.218
Is it clear, guys, all of you?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21098-0
01:43:31.648 --> 01:43:31.928
Yes.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21102-0
01:43:31.938 --> 01:43:32.108
No.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21106-0
01:43:32.118 --> 01:43:33.118
Maybe all of you got this.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21123-0
01:43:35.168 --> 01:43:40.395
13 mod 8 right, so you should
not forget this mod part also

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21123-1
01:43:40.395 --> 01:43:40.918
right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21136-0
01:43:40.928 --> 01:43:43.398
Otherwise you will, you know, go
for a bigger confusion.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21151-0
01:43:43.928 --> 01:43:45.138
But here it was all correct.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21169-0
01:43:45.148 --> 01:43:51.019
Right 8 + 5 gave you 1313 mod 8
gave you 5 which was the size of

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21169-1
01:43:51.019 --> 01:43:53.548
it, but it right all of you.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21172-0
01:43:56.918 --> 01:43:57.208
Yes.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21175-0
01:43:57.218 --> 01:43:57.388
No.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21194-0
01:43:57.398 --> 01:44:00.005
Maybe as long as you keep
deleting your F, this F value

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21194-1
01:44:00.005 --> 01:44:01.588
would have increased
accordingly.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21202-0
01:44:01.598 --> 01:44:04.358
It will give you the right
answers right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21205-0
01:44:07.358 --> 01:44:07.688
Yes.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21207-0
01:44:07.698 --> 01:44:08.048
No, maybe.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21220-0
01:44:10.618 --> 01:44:14.198
It is n -, F + R only correct.
Cool.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21231-0
01:44:14.208 --> 01:44:15.898
So what are the different
applications of this?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21243-0
01:44:15.968 --> 01:44:18.988
Right, so your computers will
not work without queues.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21250-0
01:44:19.998 --> 01:44:21.128
Yeah, as simple as that.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21263-0
01:44:21.558 --> 01:44:24.982
So internally there is some
advanced concept of CPU

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21263-1
01:44:24.982 --> 01:44:26.168
scheduling, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21279-0
01:44:26.218 --> 01:44:28.644
So even if I have multiple
applications, they'll switch

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21279-1
01:44:28.644 --> 01:44:29.988
quickly between them and so on.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21311-0
01:44:30.298 --> 01:44:33.591
So it uses CPU scheduling,
users, queues, plenty of queues

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21311-1
01:44:33.591 --> 01:44:36.885
called short term, you know
ready queue, waiting queue and

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21311-2
01:44:36.885 --> 01:44:39.788
all that and your disk
scheduling also uses queues.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21321-0
01:44:40.398 --> 01:44:42.168
There is something called as
priority queues.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21348-0
01:44:42.178 --> 01:44:45.588
We will look at it later in this
course and that will also be

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21348-1
01:44:45.588 --> 01:44:49.108
heavily used in, you know, heaps
and other advanced algorithms.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21358-0
01:44:49.378 --> 01:44:50.838
And at that time, we will have a
look at this.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21361-0
01:44:52.488 --> 01:44:52.738
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21373-0
01:44:52.748 --> 01:44:53.748
Is it clear these all of you?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21376-0
01:44:56.838 --> 01:44:57.178
Yes.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21378-0
01:44:57.188 --> 01:44:57.558
No, maybe.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21387-0
01:45:00.718 --> 01:45:01.808
Aris places and minus.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21402-0
01:45:01.818 --> 01:45:05.208
We already saw it is fast, but
it is impossible to resize.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21408-0
01:45:05.498 --> 01:45:08.688
But many applications will
require resizing, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21421-0
01:45:08.878 --> 01:45:10.788
And the required size might not
be available.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21447-0
01:45:11.018 --> 01:45:14.723
So that was the problem of array
and because we used array to

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21447-1
01:45:14.723 --> 01:45:18.249
implement stack and queue, they
also got the same problems

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21447-2
01:45:18.249 --> 01:45:18.608
right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21467-0
01:45:18.788 --> 01:45:23.286
So in order to avoid all that,
we will learn something about

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21467-1
01:45:23.286 --> 01:45:25.278
list or linked list, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21498-0
01:45:25.508 --> 01:45:28.455
A list is a sequence of items
where positional order matter

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21498-1
01:45:28.455 --> 01:45:31.305
and it is very general in
computing a list of students, a

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21498-2
01:45:31.305 --> 01:45:33.418
list of event and things like
that, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21512-0
01:45:35.028 --> 01:45:38.458
So what are the operations that
we can do on a stack real quick?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21517-0
01:45:42.828 --> 01:45:43.608
Yeah, real quick.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21534-0
01:45:43.618 --> 01:45:47.448
What are the operations that we
can do on a stack push pop top?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21537-0
01:45:48.368 --> 01:45:49.278
What about Q?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21546-0
01:45:52.458 --> 01:45:53.498
What can we do on a queue?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21563-0
01:45:57.808 --> 01:45:59.918
Yeah, in queue, what else we can
do?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21566-0
01:45:59.928 --> 01:46:03.188
NQDQ and friend, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21581-0
01:46:03.478 --> 01:46:05.948
But in a list you can do a lot
more things.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21591-0
01:46:06.398 --> 01:46:08.528
You can know what who is first,
who is last.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21627-0
01:46:08.818 --> 01:46:12.419
You can give someone and ask is
this the first position or you

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21627-1
01:46:12.419 --> 01:46:16.021
can give some position and ask
is this the last or you can ask

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21627-2
01:46:16.021 --> 01:46:17.508
who is before this who is.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21648-0
01:46:17.518 --> 01:46:21.703
After this you can ask the size
and so on right a lot more you

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21648-1
01:46:21.703 --> 01:46:22.168
can do.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21663-0
01:46:22.178 --> 01:46:24.956
You can insert after something
you can remove before someone

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21663-1
01:46:24.956 --> 01:46:25.548
and all this.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21671-0
01:46:25.818 --> 01:46:28.378
You can do a lot more operations
on a list.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21674-0
01:46:31.078 --> 01:46:31.238
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21684-0
01:46:32.298 --> 01:46:33.228
So what is a list now?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21711-0
01:46:34.838 --> 01:46:38.394
So a singly linked list is a
concrete data structure

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21711-1
01:46:38.394 --> 01:46:42.285
consisting of a sequence of
nodes and now what is a node?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21711-2
01:46:42.285 --> 01:46:42.688
Right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21720-0
01:46:42.748 --> 01:46:45.058
So this square one is a node.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21737-0
01:46:45.838 --> 01:46:49.038
There's a note it is going to
have two compartments.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21756-0
01:46:49.538 --> 01:46:53.561
One will have the actual element
and the next one is a pointer to

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21756-1
01:46:53.561 --> 01:46:54.598
the next element.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21765-0
01:46:56.158 --> 01:46:58.468
Alright, so now this is a linked
list.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21774-0
01:46:58.598 --> 01:47:01.588
This is a single linked list.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21792-0
01:47:02.648 --> 01:47:05.927
But I have E and then the
pointer to the next one and so

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21792-1
01:47:05.927 --> 01:47:06.158
one.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21794-0
01:47:06.578 --> 01:47:06.818
Right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21803-0
01:47:06.828 --> 01:47:08.228
Let me just go ahead and take.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21814-0
01:47:09.478 --> 01:47:11.688
Let's suppose this isn't address
4000.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21822-0
01:47:11.758 --> 01:47:13.268
This is an address 8000.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21837-0
01:47:13.638 --> 01:47:18.138
This is in 8400 and this is in
say 9100.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21855-0
01:47:19.418 --> 01:47:25.538
No, this 8000 will be here and
this will have 8400.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21863-0
01:47:26.128 --> 01:47:27.258
Maybe this is not very visible.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21874-0
01:47:28.718 --> 01:47:30.038
8000 will be here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21880-0
01:47:30.378 --> 01:47:32.008
8400 is here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21889-0
01:47:32.318 --> 01:47:35.248
9100 is here and here you have
empty.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21892-0
01:47:37.108 --> 01:47:37.378
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21904-0
01:47:37.388 --> 01:47:38.598
Is it clear for all of you guys?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21912-0
01:47:38.888 --> 01:47:41.558
So a node contains 2
compartments.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21941-0
01:47:41.918 --> 01:47:45.554
The first one is the element
part, the second one is the

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21941-1
01:47:45.554 --> 01:47:49.446
pointer to the next node, so
right it will have that address

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21941-2
01:47:49.446 --> 01:47:50.978
of the next node, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21952-0
01:47:51.048 --> 01:47:54.658
So now is it linear in the
memory?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21962-0
01:47:58.158 --> 01:48:00.678
Is this data structure linear in
the memory?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21968-0
01:48:03.038 --> 01:48:03.788
Makes an explosion.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21972-0
01:48:03.798 --> 01:48:04.228
It is not.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21988-0
01:48:04.238 --> 01:48:07.004
It can be anywhere in the
memory, but it is still a linear

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/21988-1
01:48:07.004 --> 01:48:07.708
data structure.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22004-0
01:48:10.598 --> 01:48:14.218
You can always go from A to BB
to CC2D only, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22012-0
01:48:15.178 --> 01:48:17.268
But there is some disadvantage
here, correct?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22035-0
01:48:17.758 --> 01:48:21.543
Let's say suppose you are in D
if you are in D, will you be

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22035-1
01:48:21.543 --> 01:48:22.868
able to go back to a?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22050-0
01:48:25.288 --> 01:48:27.958
If you are in deposition
already, you are standing here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22068-0
01:48:28.148 --> 01:48:30.958
Will you be able to go back to a
or will you be able to go back

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22068-1
01:48:30.958 --> 01:48:31.178
to B?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22098-0
01:48:31.188 --> 01:48:34.121
No, because your loss, that
pointer, all that you can do is

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22098-1
01:48:34.121 --> 01:48:36.958
you'll have to again come back
from the beginning, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22114-0
01:48:38.008 --> 01:48:41.308
If you want to add a new one,
how will you do so?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22126-0
01:48:41.318 --> 01:48:45.088
We say that links can
dynamically grow or shrink.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22129-0
01:48:45.198 --> 01:48:45.578
How's that?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22153-0
01:48:46.438 --> 01:48:50.461
Because I can create a new node
somewhere in memory, I will name

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22153-1
01:48:50.461 --> 01:48:52.628
it E I'll give the element
inside.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22173-0
01:48:52.698 --> 01:48:56.284
Let's say suppose this got
stored in memory in say address

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22173-1
01:48:56.284 --> 01:48:56.588
9500.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22190-0
01:48:57.468 --> 01:49:01.108
All that I should do is I'll
have to change this to 9500.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22208-0
01:49:02.058 --> 01:49:05.141
The moment I do that, this will
start pointing here and I will

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22208-1
01:49:05.141 --> 01:49:06.218
make this to be empty.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22241-0
01:49:06.928 --> 01:49:09.915
That's why I can dynamically
grow this list or when I don't

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22241-1
01:49:09.915 --> 01:49:13.052
want someone I will just delete
him and I'll make its previous

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22241-2
01:49:13.052 --> 01:49:13.998
pointer to be null.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22245-0
01:49:14.738 --> 01:49:16.028
That's it, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22266-0
01:49:16.038 --> 01:49:19.923
But as I told there is this
problem of I cannot go in the

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22266-1
01:49:19.923 --> 01:49:21.598
reverse direction, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22281-0
01:49:21.808 --> 01:49:23.928
And that is why we have a doubly
linked list.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22313-0
01:49:25.568 --> 01:49:29.707
Now this doubly linked list node
has three compartments, one is

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22313-1
01:49:29.707 --> 01:49:33.912
the actual element you have the
pointer to the next node and the

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22313-2
01:49:33.912 --> 01:49:35.788
pointer to the previous node.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22320-0
01:49:37.118 --> 01:49:39.328
A doubly linked list is often
more convenient.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22333-0
01:49:39.568 --> 01:49:41.948
They have the element linked to
the previous and next node.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22350-0
01:49:42.358 --> 01:49:45.578
It also has special trailer and
header nodes which has the

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22350-1
01:49:45.578 --> 01:49:46.998
address of the first node.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22356-0
01:49:47.008 --> 01:49:47.968
This is the header.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22377-0
01:49:48.078 --> 01:49:51.522
The trailer will have the last
nodes position so in either

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22377-1
01:49:51.522 --> 01:49:53.858
direction you will be able to
traverse.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22380-0
01:49:55.888 --> 01:49:56.158
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22386-0
01:49:56.168 --> 01:49:56.638
Is this clear?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22388-0
01:49:56.648 --> 01:49:57.258
Guys, all of you?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22391-0
01:49:59.378 --> 01:49:59.678
Yes.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22393-0
01:49:59.688 --> 01:50:00.068
No, maybe.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22399-0
01:50:04.818 --> 01:50:05.018
Cool.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22409-0
01:50:05.678 --> 01:50:08.728
But now I want to go to the
frog.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22426-0
01:50:08.788 --> 01:50:12.653
This position I want to go
really be able to directly go to

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22426-1
01:50:12.653 --> 01:50:14.458
the frog just like an array.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22438-0
01:50:16.478 --> 01:50:17.988
I don't even know where this
frog is.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22441-0
01:50:18.918 --> 01:50:19.298
Right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22448-0
01:50:19.888 --> 01:50:21.518
I should start from the header.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22454-0
01:50:21.528 --> 01:50:22.498
I should take the address.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22458-0
01:50:22.508 --> 01:50:23.758
I should go here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22466-0
01:50:23.888 --> 01:50:25.218
I should take the next address.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22475-0
01:50:25.228 --> 01:50:27.698
I should go here and check if
this is frog.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22482-0
01:50:27.708 --> 01:50:29.498
No, I'll take the next address.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22486-0
01:50:29.508 --> 01:50:30.118
I'll go here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22494-0
01:50:30.128 --> 01:50:31.258
I'll check if it is frog. Yes.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22500-0
01:50:32.238 --> 01:50:33.288
So what is the complexity?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22506-0
01:50:34.678 --> 01:50:36.118
Yeah, either from header or
trailer.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22513-0
01:50:38.438 --> 01:50:39.648
So what is the complexity?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22520-0
01:50:40.068 --> 01:50:40.768
Yeah, very good.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22524-0
01:50:40.808 --> 01:50:41.618
It is big.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22530-0
01:50:41.628 --> 01:50:42.178
Oh yen.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22536-0
01:50:42.548 --> 01:50:44.078
So I should traverse the list.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22550-0
01:50:44.088 --> 01:50:47.288
I cannot directly go take
something that I like, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22575-0
01:50:47.658 --> 01:50:50.790
I'll have to traverse it, which
is the disadvantage of linked

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22575-1
01:50:50.790 --> 01:50:54.024
list, but there is one positive
that it can grow dynamically or

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22575-2
01:50:54.024 --> 01:50:54.378
shrink.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22585-0
01:50:56.678 --> 01:51:00.038
Right, so insertion algorithm
right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22612-0
01:51:00.048 --> 01:51:03.027
So as I told you can do a lot of
things with link list, but we

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22612-1
01:51:03.027 --> 01:51:05.298
will just look at 1 insertion
and one deletion.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22645-0
01:51:05.428 --> 01:51:08.261
Yeah, the others you can
actually, you know, take a try

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22645-1
01:51:08.261 --> 01:51:11.297
of these first, last and you
know is first you can actually

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22645-2
01:51:11.297 --> 01:51:12.158
look at all this.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22650-0
01:51:12.548 --> 01:51:13.708
We'll just look at 2 examples.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22673-0
01:51:15.538 --> 01:51:20.972
Visualize the operation insert
after PX, meaning I want this

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22673-1
01:51:20.972 --> 01:51:25.338
element X to be inserted after
the PTH position.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22686-0
01:51:26.548 --> 01:51:29.038
So firstly you have to traverse
still there, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22691-0
01:51:29.428 --> 01:51:30.078
I go here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22702-0
01:51:30.088 --> 01:51:32.658
I found out this is the peak
position right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22714-0
01:51:32.968 --> 01:51:36.168
And here between this B&amp;CI
want to insert here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22718-0
01:51:38.218 --> 01:51:38.458
Right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22725-0
01:51:39.348 --> 01:51:40.198
Is the problem clear?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22727-0
01:51:40.208 --> 01:51:40.768
Base all of you?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22730-0
01:51:43.398 --> 01:51:43.708
Yes.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22747-0
01:51:43.718 --> 01:51:48.268
No, maybe I want to insert an
element after the peak position.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22762-0
01:51:48.318 --> 01:51:50.496
The peak position will be second
position, the third position,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22762-1
01:51:50.496 --> 01:51:50.808
whatever.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22784-0
01:51:50.978 --> 01:51:53.727
In this case, I have told after
the second position, so this is

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22784-1
01:51:53.727 --> 01:51:55.488
the first position, the second
position.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22801-0
01:51:56.018 --> 01:51:59.216
After this I want to insert here
so there are five things that I

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22801-1
01:51:59.216 --> 01:51:59.758
have to do.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22809-0
01:52:00.998 --> 01:52:03.148
I will tell each step very
clearly.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22814-0
01:52:03.498 --> 01:52:04.348
Just try to follow me.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22825-0
01:52:06.028 --> 01:52:08.698
Firstly I will create this box
correct?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22843-0
01:52:09.088 --> 01:52:12.976
I'll have to create this
compartment or node somewhere in

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22843-1
01:52:12.976 --> 01:52:14.518
memory that is 1 right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22858-0
01:52:15.628 --> 01:52:19.538
Second thing, I'll create it and
I'll have the value as X

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22858-1
01:52:19.538 --> 01:52:20.078
correct?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22872-0
01:52:20.088 --> 01:52:22.088
That is what I want to insert,
that is one first step.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22880-0
01:52:23.248 --> 01:52:24.628
There is a second step involved.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22891-0
01:52:24.638 --> 01:52:26.448
That is, I'll have to update
this.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22901-0
01:52:27.578 --> 01:52:31.328
The new nodes previous and the
new nodes next.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22905-0
01:52:31.338 --> 01:52:32.138
Also I should update.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22922-0
01:52:34.098 --> 01:52:37.408
So now this node has joined to
the linked list.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22931-0
01:52:37.718 --> 01:52:39.468
So when I created him, he was an
orphan.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22963-0
01:52:39.478 --> 01:52:43.746
He was somewhere in the memory,
but the moment I have updated

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22963-1
01:52:43.746 --> 01:52:48.083
this previous and next of this
node, yes come into this linked

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22963-2
01:52:48.083 --> 01:52:48.428
list.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22982-0
01:52:48.858 --> 01:52:52.960
But even now, the beast next
part is not updated and C's

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22982-1
01:52:52.960 --> 01:52:55.048
previous part is not updated.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22993-0
01:52:55.088 --> 01:52:57.668
So that also I should do four
and five.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/22997-0
01:52:58.728 --> 01:52:59.898
So 5 operations.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23008-0
01:52:59.908 --> 01:53:01.788
If I do, I'll be able to get it
done.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23011-0
01:53:03.408 --> 01:53:03.658
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23029-0
01:53:03.668 --> 01:53:07.838
Is this clear for all of you, a
node has three memory spaces.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23033-0
01:53:07.848 --> 01:53:08.538
Yes, that's right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23044-0
01:53:08.848 --> 01:53:10.818
Yeah, it has three compartment
we saw here, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23049-0
01:53:11.128 --> 01:53:12.198
It has three compartments.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23054-0
01:53:13.598 --> 01:53:14.688
Yeah, I'll come again.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23067-0
01:53:15.318 --> 01:53:18.328
What are the very first step I
should create a node?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23072-0
01:53:18.418 --> 01:53:19.108
Do you agree to that?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23080-0
01:53:19.118 --> 01:53:21.588
All of you, that is my first
step.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23093-0
01:53:24.208 --> 01:53:26.668
This I can create an anywhere in
the memory correct?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23107-0
01:53:26.678 --> 01:53:29.688
Let's us suppose I have created
this in memory location 3000.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23111-0
01:53:30.488 --> 01:53:31.438
I've only created it.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23120-0
01:53:31.448 --> 01:53:32.918
I have put its value as X.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23124-0
01:53:33.368 --> 01:53:34.218
He's orphan now.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23143-0
01:53:34.228 --> 01:53:37.213
He's not even there in the
linked list, so I should be

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23143-1
01:53:37.213 --> 01:53:38.408
updating his previous.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23152-0
01:53:40.108 --> 01:53:42.758
I should be updating this next
third operation.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23159-0
01:53:43.188 --> 01:53:45.158
I should update this, B is next.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23168-0
01:53:45.168 --> 01:53:46.828
He should now be pointing to
this node.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23182-0
01:53:47.568 --> 01:53:49.998
Britain sort of see he should
know, point to this X.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23202-0
01:53:50.368 --> 01:53:54.414
That is my 4th operation and
this sees previous he should now

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23202-1
01:53:54.414 --> 01:53:55.198
not go to B.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23217-0
01:53:55.208 --> 01:53:59.358
He should go to X, so that is
May 5th Operation I operations.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23226-0
01:53:59.368 --> 01:53:59.978
You should be able to.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23238-0
01:54:01.338 --> 01:54:04.388
If we do that, then we have
successfully inserted correctly.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23246-0
01:54:05.388 --> 01:54:06.258
It's not all of you.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23249-0
01:54:06.268 --> 01:54:07.088
Visually it is clear.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23255-0
01:54:08.948 --> 01:54:09.978
Yeah, programmatically.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23289-0
01:54:09.988 --> 01:54:13.845
We we'll come there, but
visually is it clear create a

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23289-1
01:54:13.845 --> 01:54:17.984
node that is step one in that
newly created node we should

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23289-2
01:54:17.984 --> 01:54:20.018
update its previous and next.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23317-0
01:54:20.128 --> 01:54:23.437
So three things we have done and
then in the actual link list,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23317-1
01:54:23.437 --> 01:54:26.432
we'll have to update the
corresponding next and previous

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23317-2
01:54:26.432 --> 01:54:26.958
positions.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23327-0
01:54:27.308 --> 01:54:29.218
Then the node would have got
joined like this.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23339-0
01:54:29.548 --> 01:54:33.678
Now B's next becomes **, next
becomes CC's.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23362-0
01:54:33.688 --> 01:54:37.665
Previous becomes X&amp;X is
previous becomes B, so it's a

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23362-1
01:54:37.665 --> 01:54:39.448
proper link list Now yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23367-0
01:54:39.458 --> 01:54:40.268
And then he very good.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23378-0
01:54:40.278 --> 01:54:43.238
Yeah, that's exactly what we
have done here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23392-0
01:54:44.308 --> 01:54:47.038
Create a node, set the element
as ex.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23407-0
01:54:47.168 --> 01:54:50.547
So we have a variable E this
variable E will have that value

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23407-1
01:54:50.547 --> 01:54:50.658
X.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23416-0
01:54:51.008 --> 01:54:52.788
So these two I can call a test
step one.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23421-0
01:54:54.458 --> 01:54:54.738
Right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23423-0
01:54:54.748 --> 01:54:55.418
That is step one.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23446-0
01:54:57.238 --> 01:55:00.677
B Dot set previous P This is the
second step, meaning I have set

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23446-1
01:55:00.677 --> 01:55:01.788
its previous element.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23469-0
01:55:03.708 --> 01:55:07.139
V Dot set next, meaning I'm
setting is set next, but there's

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23469-1
01:55:07.139 --> 01:55:08.658
a very clever way to do it.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23491-0
01:55:08.668 --> 01:55:14.068
How I have set this is if I do
we dot set next where will I go?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23502-0
01:55:15.678 --> 01:55:16.938
Can someone tell me where I will
go?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23511-0
01:55:17.988 --> 01:55:20.888
And in this particular node, if
I do.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23526-0
01:55:24.218 --> 01:55:28.638
Yeah, I want to set this next to
value, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23538-0
01:55:29.168 --> 01:55:32.158
I am currently residing here in
B, correct?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23551-0
01:55:33.208 --> 01:55:36.888
If I do P dot get next, what
will it give me?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23554-0
01:55:38.178 --> 01:55:40.348
This guy, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23587-0
01:55:40.738 --> 01:55:43.833
This guy is nothing but my C so
that is what I wanted here, so I

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23587-1
01:55:43.833 --> 01:55:46.548
will copy it here for this line
is a very powerful line.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23599-0
01:55:46.998 --> 01:55:50.788
I'm telling V dot set next,
which is this compartment.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23611-0
01:55:50.918 --> 01:55:55.448
I'm copying the P dot get next
done so three steps.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23618-0
01:55:55.458 --> 01:55:57.188
Meaning I have created a node.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23624-0
01:55:57.198 --> 01:55:58.128
I have the element.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23649-0
01:55:58.138 --> 01:56:02.508
I have its previous and next but
till now also it has not.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23656-0
01:56:02.518 --> 01:56:05.239
Actually, you know fully
completed this part and this

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23656-1
01:56:05.239 --> 01:56:06.248
part is not changed.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23681-0
01:56:07.378 --> 01:56:11.295
So that also we have done it in
a very, you know elegant way P

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23681-1
01:56:11.295 --> 01:56:14.528
dot get next the moment I do
this, where will I go?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23757-0
01:56:16.328 --> 01:56:20.461
Michelle, can someone guess if
they do P dot getnext I would

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23757-1
01:56:20.461 --> 01:56:24.527
have reached this sea in that
I'm doing C dot previous this

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23757-2
01:56:24.527 --> 01:56:28.864
compartment I'm sending it to V
so that I established this link

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23757-3
01:56:28.864 --> 01:56:33.065
and then I do P dot set next
meaning this value I erase it, I

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23757-4
01:56:33.065 --> 01:56:35.708
set it to so I make use of this
value.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23773-0
01:56:35.718 --> 01:56:40.458
I set this C's previous first
and then I do this part.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23787-0
01:56:41.648 --> 01:56:46.058
If you interchange these two
lines it will not work right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23798-0
01:56:46.068 --> 01:56:48.068
And finally you return the V
telling I've completed it.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23805-0
01:56:49.168 --> 01:56:50.048
So is this clear guys?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23807-0
01:56:50.058 --> 01:56:50.588
For all of you?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23816-0
01:56:53.028 --> 01:56:54.158
These two is first step.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23826-0
01:56:54.168 --> 01:56:56.258
This is second step, third step,
4th step.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23831-0
01:56:56.268 --> 01:56:57.278
Step. You're done.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23842-0
01:56:57.978 --> 01:56:59.588
Yeah, this is exactly what you
know.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23850-0
01:56:59.598 --> 01:57:00.888
And then you had put up in
words.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23865-0
01:57:03.548 --> 01:57:06.418
What will be the result of the
new node E dot getnext?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23873-0
01:57:06.728 --> 01:57:08.578
Will it give the random memory
location?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23877-0
01:57:09.048 --> 01:57:09.698
No, not really.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23893-0
01:57:10.838 --> 01:57:13.148
So this V dot get next we have
already set it right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23897-0
01:57:13.158 --> 01:57:14.108
It'll take me to C.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23914-0
01:57:16.228 --> 01:57:18.641
Initially, before you have said
that it will give you some junk

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23914-1
01:57:18.641 --> 01:57:18.868
value.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23916-0
01:57:20.908 --> 01:57:21.068
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23920-0
01:57:24.818 --> 01:57:25.068
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23932-0
01:57:25.078 --> 01:57:27.088
Is it clear, guys, all of you
try to trace them?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23934-0
01:57:27.098 --> 01:57:27.308
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23972-0
01:57:27.318 --> 01:57:31.975
So the best way to learn this is
take some notes and as I told

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23972-1
01:57:31.975 --> 01:57:36.262
have some values have 8005
thousand and all that and then

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23972-2
01:57:36.262 --> 01:57:38.628
try to trace each of them right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23982-0
01:57:38.638 --> 01:57:40.398
See see which values are going
here?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23990-0
01:57:40.768 --> 01:57:41.718
What is a pointing to?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23995-0
01:57:41.728 --> 01:57:42.638
What is this pointing to?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/23999-0
01:57:42.648 --> 01:57:43.138
What is this?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24009-0
01:57:43.148 --> 01:57:44.848
What is this so trace like that?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24016-0
01:57:44.858 --> 01:57:47.638
And that is the best way to
learn. Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24020-0
01:57:47.648 --> 01:57:48.038
Will you do that?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24026-0
01:57:50.818 --> 01:57:52.068
Deletion is very simple.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24047-0
01:57:52.258 --> 01:57:57.361
Yeah, I want to remove this node
P But yeah, I want to go till

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24047-1
01:57:57.361 --> 01:57:58.738
there after I go.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24058-0
01:57:58.748 --> 01:58:00.058
What is the only change I have
to do?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24073-0
01:58:01.448 --> 01:58:06.062
I love to make this point to
this and make this point to this

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24073-1
01:58:06.062 --> 01:58:06.658
correct.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24087-0
01:58:08.328 --> 01:58:09.698
Are you able to visualize guys
all of you?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24092-0
01:58:11.058 --> 01:58:12.168
Currently this is the state.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24104-0
01:58:12.238 --> 01:58:13.478
I know this node I want to
delete.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24115-0
01:58:14.468 --> 01:58:16.758
That simply means I want to
point this to here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24129-0
01:58:16.808 --> 01:58:19.767
I want to point this previous to
here and knock this full guy

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24129-1
01:58:19.767 --> 01:58:19.958
off.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24132-0
01:58:22.688 --> 01:58:23.038
How?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24165-0
01:58:23.048 --> 01:58:26.537
How to find which is the P
element by value or by checking

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24165-1
01:58:26.537 --> 01:58:30.440
next address no P here means the
position meaning that third node

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24165-2
01:58:30.440 --> 01:58:31.268
or fifth node.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24178-0
01:58:31.578 --> 01:58:34.258
So you have to traverse that
many nodes Aishwarya, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24188-0
01:58:34.558 --> 01:58:37.148
So here the example says delete
the 4th row.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24211-0
01:58:37.938 --> 01:58:40.625
That's why should start from the
beginning and it has told delete

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24211-1
01:58:40.625 --> 01:58:41.928
the 4th node from the beginning.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24216-0
01:58:43.048 --> 01:58:44.038
So I go here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24227-0
01:58:44.268 --> 01:58:46.608
This is the first note I'm
keeping account as one.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24233-0
01:58:47.068 --> 01:58:48.578
I'm going here count as two.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24238-0
01:58:49.238 --> 01:58:49.968
I'm going here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24243-0
01:58:50.018 --> 01:58:50.768
Count is 3.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24246-0
01:58:51.038 --> 01:58:51.688
I'm going here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24260-0
01:58:51.698 --> 01:58:53.888
Count is 4, so this is the node
I want to delete.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24277-0
01:58:54.718 --> 01:58:58.808
So that is the PP tells me the
count of or the position of it.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24291-0
01:58:59.498 --> 01:59:01.768
So I have to count it and then
go there and delete it.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24294-0
01:59:03.108 --> 01:59:03.618
But delete.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24306-0
01:59:03.628 --> 01:59:06.738
Are you are able to visualize 20
simple guys?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24337-0
01:59:07.898 --> 01:59:10.873
All that I'll have to do, for
example, if you want to delete

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24337-1
01:59:10.873 --> 01:59:13.800
B, some people can also give
that they will tell delete the

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24337-2
01:59:13.800 --> 01:59:14.678
node with value B.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24355-0
01:59:14.978 --> 01:59:17.075
So then again, you have to
traverse and see that you know

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24355-1
01:59:17.075 --> 01:59:18.088
this node is having value B.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24364-0
01:59:18.098 --> 01:59:19.278
So this is what I want to
delete.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24375-0
01:59:20.388 --> 01:59:22.498
What does the delete all
deletion entitle?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24384-0
01:59:23.218 --> 01:59:24.448
I'll have to join this to here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24401-0
01:59:25.378 --> 01:59:28.678
I love to join this compartment
to hear A and I can just knock

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24401-1
01:59:28.678 --> 01:59:29.098
him off.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24404-0
01:59:31.008 --> 01:59:31.538
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24410-0
01:59:31.588 --> 01:59:32.908
Is everyone getting the
deletion?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24422-0
01:59:34.818 --> 01:59:38.788
I don't see any sponsors, so I'm
a little concerned.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24437-0
01:59:41.988 --> 01:59:44.388
Got no need of code, but are you
able to visualize this?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24448-0
01:59:45.908 --> 01:59:47.818
Yeah, deletion part.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24459-0
01:59:47.828 --> 01:59:50.538
If you want to delete B, I'll
have to join this here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24471-0
01:59:50.548 --> 01:59:52.778
I'll have to join this previous
2A.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24478-0
01:59:53.488 --> 01:59:55.788
This is next will become C,
right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24487-0
01:59:57.278 --> 01:59:58.468
So just two lines of code.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24501-0
01:59:58.478 --> 02:00:01.734
So again, this is formality I'm
taking in a variable and I'm

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24501-1
02:00:01.734 --> 02:00:02.428
returning it.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24532-0
02:00:02.838 --> 02:00:08.544
I'm setting the nulls right, but
these two are the actual links

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24532-1
02:00:08.544 --> 02:00:13.538
where in P dot get previous
right I'm setting the next.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24543-0
02:00:14.048 --> 02:00:17.278
I'm setting the next to P dot
getnext, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24577-0
02:00:17.488 --> 02:00:20.835
So if I'm in P here, what I'm
doing actually P dot get

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24577-1
02:00:20.835 --> 02:00:24.547
previous will take me here in
that I'm setting the next disk

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24577-2
02:00:24.547 --> 02:00:25.278
compartment.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24587-0
02:00:25.648 --> 02:00:28.058
I'm setting it to P dot get next
this one.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24595-0
02:00:28.328 --> 02:00:30.278
This one is actually the next
value, right?

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24605-0
02:00:30.408 --> 02:00:31.568
So this same copying here.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24633-0
02:00:32.348 --> 02:00:36.087
Similarly in P dot getnext, the
moment I go here this

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24633-1
02:00:36.087 --> 02:00:40.380
compartment I'm setting it to
this one which is nothing but P

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24633-2
02:00:40.380 --> 02:00:41.558
dot get previous.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24700-0
02:00:41.628 --> 02:00:45.141
Yes, it's a very simple stuff,
but you know we have returned

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24700-1
02:00:45.141 --> 02:00:48.482
some elegant one liner quotes,
but if you are new to this

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24700-2
02:00:48.482 --> 02:00:51.938
please try to, you know put some
values and you know try to

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24700-3
02:00:51.938 --> 02:00:55.682
practice each get previous where
are you going and set next what

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24700-4
02:00:55.682 --> 02:00:58.678
are you setting, what is the
value and so on right.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24703-0
02:00:59.108 --> 02:00:59.818
Then it'll be clear.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24708-0
02:01:01.458 --> 02:01:01.688
Cool.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24716-0
02:01:01.698 --> 02:01:03.148
I think that's pretty much so.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24763-0
02:01:03.158 --> 02:01:06.735
We will continue from here in
tomorrow's class and you know,

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24763-1
02:01:06.735 --> 02:01:10.254
so try to practice this and
it'll be no even more clear and

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24763-2
02:01:10.254 --> 02:01:13.421
some exercises I had given in
between those, you know

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24763-3
02:01:13.421 --> 02:01:15.298
evaluation of postfix and so on.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24788-0
02:01:15.568 --> 02:01:18.613
So try to do that and put it in
our sections discussion and you

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24788-1
02:01:18.613 --> 02:01:20.088
know, we'll take it from there.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24790-0
02:01:21.678 --> 02:01:21.878
Yeah.

503e2326-209c-480a-916c-9133abc7863a/24794-0
02:01:21.888 --> 02:01:22.458
Anything else guys?
