ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/52-0
00:00:12.061 --> 00:00:12.721
Hi, good morning.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/71-0
00:00:31.611 --> 00:00:32.941
So do you have a full day class
today?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/75-0
00:00:40.391 --> 00:00:40.971
OK, OK.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/95-0
00:00:55.401 --> 00:00:57.638
We'll wait for a couple of more
minutes and then we'll get

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/95-1
00:00:57.638 --> 00:00:57.941
started.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/110-0
00:01:07.471 --> 00:01:09.801
So assume people are on
vacations and so on.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/121-0
00:01:09.881 --> 00:01:12.701
Maybe we'll not have a very
large strength.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/133-0
00:01:14.911 --> 00:01:16.641
Yeah, yeah, I have just replied
to you the clip.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/135-0
00:01:16.651 --> 00:01:16.851
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/146-0
00:01:16.861 --> 00:01:19.191
So I will be posting after the
class.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/166-0
00:01:19.651 --> 00:01:22.596
Yeah, after every class
immediately you would be seeing

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/166-1
00:01:22.596 --> 00:01:24.751
the PPT, but not before the
class, yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/171-0
00:01:28.261 --> 00:01:29.141
Yeah, Amit, go ahead.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/194-0
00:01:36.341 --> 00:01:39.469
But in my recordings, all the
that I write on the slide will

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/194-1
00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:40.391
also be available.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/200-0
00:01:40.401 --> 00:01:41.491
Yeah, don't worry about that.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/222-0
00:01:42.261 --> 00:01:46.358
So in the webinar I had seen a
discussion that you know what

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/222-1
00:01:46.358 --> 00:01:47.231
the TA route.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/237-0
00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:50.575
I mean Soujanya had return
something I believe, but that

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/237-1
00:01:50.575 --> 00:01:52.431
was not visible in the
recording.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/250-0
00:01:52.441 --> 00:01:54.931
Yeah, only the presentation and
her voice was available.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/261-0
00:01:55.401 --> 00:01:57.671
So I'll ensure that you know
that doesn't repeat.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/266-0
00:02:02.561 --> 00:02:02.831
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/275-0
00:02:02.841 --> 00:02:04.191
What do you mean by that Amit?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/281-0
00:02:04.261 --> 00:02:05.211
Recording of the lecture.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/292-0
00:02:05.221 --> 00:02:08.341
Sometimes not able to see due to
your Internet issues.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/295-0
00:02:08.351 --> 00:02:08.801
What you mean?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/309-0
00:02:11.821 --> 00:02:13.991
Was the recordings are coming
out fine?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/314-0
00:02:14.061 --> 00:02:14.641
What about others?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/324-0
00:02:15.931 --> 00:02:17.901
You watch the recordings and is
it all fine?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/330-0
00:02:21.321 --> 00:02:21.981
Hi, good morning.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/337-0
00:02:25.951 --> 00:02:28.031
Yeah, it should be fine so.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/343-0
00:02:29.961 --> 00:02:30.631
Yeah, maybe not.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/352-0
00:02:30.641 --> 00:02:32.371
PT is given again and again and
repeat.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/357-0
00:02:32.381 --> 00:02:33.711
Please go to announcement.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/394-0
00:02:33.781 --> 00:02:37.530
Go to the course page and in the
main announcement right where

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/394-1
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.802
you had seen webinar one is
today there was a you know

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/394-2
00:02:40.802 --> 00:02:43.181
announcement in that same
announcement.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/406-0
00:02:43.191 --> 00:02:46.736
If you go in, the presentation
is updated as a comment there,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/406-1
00:02:46.736 --> 00:02:47.021
yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/413-0
00:02:51.561 --> 00:02:53.311
Yeah, download option is
available.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/436-0
00:02:53.321 --> 00:02:56.872
I mean the only option is to
actually view it or there is

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/436-1
00:02:56.872 --> 00:02:59.871
another option for, you know
viewing it offline?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/473-0
00:02:59.881 --> 00:03:03.914
Maybe you can just, you know,
drop in an email and I'll loop

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/473-1
00:03:03.914 --> 00:03:07.351
you into that DC OPS team and
they will assist you.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/485-0
00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:10.101
Yeah, within the app it should
be possible.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/500-0
00:03:10.111 --> 00:03:13.407
Yeah, without Internet it will
work, but you cannot download it

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/500-1
00:03:13.407 --> 00:03:14.231
outside the app.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/505-0
00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:20.431
OK.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/535-0
00:03:20.441 --> 00:03:23.168
Other questions or one question
is there only one type of crew

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/535-1
00:03:23.168 --> 00:03:25.851
which is binary or we can have
other categories also as free?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/538-0
00:03:26.021 --> 00:03:26.291
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/543-0
00:03:26.301 --> 00:03:27.831
So binary is only one, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/561-0
00:03:27.841 --> 00:03:31.321
So if it has only, you know,
maximum two children, then that

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/561-1
00:03:31.321 --> 00:03:31.891
is binary.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/577-0
00:03:32.181 --> 00:03:34.712
But we are putting again
constraints on strict binary

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/577-1
00:03:34.712 --> 00:03:36.071
complete binary and all that.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/586-0
00:03:36.241 --> 00:03:38.131
So they're all different types
of binary.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/591-0
00:03:38.141 --> 00:03:39.231
Only then, right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/615-0
00:03:39.241 --> 00:03:42.900
Because firstly they are binary
and then on top of it you have

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/615-1
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.861
some other rules like complete
binary tree, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/626-0
00:03:45.871 --> 00:03:48.311
So the word itself has binary
again, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/642-0
00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:51.296
So on top of binary, if you put
other constraints, they become

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/642-1
00:03:51.296 --> 00:03:52.061
other categories.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/644-0
00:03:56.041 --> 00:03:56.161
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/652-0
00:04:02.631 --> 00:04:02.901
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/662-0
00:04:02.911 --> 00:04:04.341
Which one do you want me to
show, Amit?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/668-0
00:04:04.991 --> 00:04:05.891
I'm not sure about it.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/677-0
00:04:08.371 --> 00:04:09.811
Let me just quickly share my
screen.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/686-0
00:04:13.681 --> 00:04:15.701
You mean the webinar
presentation?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/691-0
00:04:20.871 --> 00:04:21.091
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/697-0
00:04:21.101 --> 00:04:22.591
Let me know once the browser is
visible.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/707-0
00:04:26.341 --> 00:04:26.561
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/715-0
00:04:26.571 --> 00:04:27.871
So this is our core speech.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/747-0
00:04:28.261 --> 00:04:32.238
Just go into announcements and
this there is a webinar 1 today,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/747-1
00:04:32.238 --> 00:04:34.971
you know which was posted on
21st December.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/769-0
00:04:35.831 --> 00:04:40.079
If you go into it, there is a
comment here which says please

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/769-1
00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:41.541
find the webinar PPT.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/771-0
00:04:41.651 --> 00:04:42.221
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/782-0
00:04:42.481 --> 00:04:46.461
And the recording or as usual,
available in teams. Cool.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/810-0
00:04:48.501 --> 00:04:51.610
And that in app download, maybe
you can just try to the you know

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/810-1
00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.571
DSC OPS and they will support
you, yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/825-0
00:05:00.981 --> 00:05:03.428
We'll wait for another minute
and then we will get started,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/825-1
00:05:03.428 --> 00:05:03.631
yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/848-0
00:05:07.031 --> 00:05:10.313
Yeah, you should have received
all these long back, but I'm not

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/848-1
00:05:10.313 --> 00:05:12.261
sure why there is confusion even
now.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/869-0
00:05:14.391 --> 00:05:16.883
So when you join the program,
you would have got all these

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/869-1
00:05:16.883 --> 00:05:17.811
details in your email.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/876-0
00:05:19.541 --> 00:05:20.491
Yeah, this is Damien.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/899-0
00:05:24.501 --> 00:05:28.541
You can just try to them asking
how do you do offline in app you

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/899-1
00:05:28.541 --> 00:05:28.851
know.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/913-0
00:05:30.431 --> 00:05:32.831
Download for that without
Internet you can watch, yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/925-0
00:05:35.261 --> 00:05:36.631
OK, there was a question on
this.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/932-0
00:05:41.151 --> 00:05:42.031
Yes, give me a minute.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/955-0
00:05:46.461 --> 00:05:49.161
That any inputs for our midterm
exam, what all resources we

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/955-1
00:05:49.161 --> 00:05:50.511
should refer to the operation?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/959-0
00:05:50.741 --> 00:05:51.031
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/995-0
00:05:51.041 --> 00:05:54.905
So very first thing would be to
attend classes or if you have

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/995-1
00:05:54.905 --> 00:05:58.457
missed it, watch the live
recordings and also go through

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/995-2
00:05:58.457 --> 00:06:02.008
the PTS and every presentation
of mine has some practice

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/995-3
00:06:02.008 --> 00:06:02.631
questions.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/999-0
00:06:02.881 --> 00:06:03.491
Practice them.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1035-0
00:06:03.501 --> 00:06:06.679
That is your second step, so
this is this whole thing is the

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1035-1
00:06:06.679 --> 00:06:09.909
first step right where you are
aware of all the materials you

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1035-2
00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:11.471
have learned all the concepts.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1047-0
00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:13.991
You've also put some, you know,
practice on those questions.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1054-0
00:06:14.001 --> 00:06:15.311
There will be your first step.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1069-0
00:06:15.581 --> 00:06:18.795
The second step would be to go
to your textbook and read some

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1069-1
00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:19.261
concepts.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1083-0
00:06:19.271 --> 00:06:21.591
If you're still not clear, you
know, practice some questions

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1083-1
00:06:21.591 --> 00:06:21.971
and so on.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1111-0
00:06:23.121 --> 00:06:26.990
And the third step would be to
go beyond your textbook where

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1111-1
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.731
you go to your CRS textbook or
online resources and so on.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1132-0
00:06:31.021 --> 00:06:35.481
And what I would be also doing
is exactly after the last class,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1132-1
00:06:35.481 --> 00:06:37.641
right after our eighth session.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1140-0
00:06:37.971 --> 00:06:40.281
I'll also be uploading a sample
paper.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1143-0
00:06:40.731 --> 00:06:41.001
Right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1151-0
00:06:41.011 --> 00:06:43.501
I'll not be providing any key
for it.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1161-0
00:06:43.511 --> 00:06:45.071
It's up to you to, you know,
solve it.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1168-0
00:06:45.131 --> 00:06:46.601
Discuss among yourselves, and so
on.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1175-0
00:06:46.831 --> 00:06:47.981
But it's just a sample.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1177-0
00:06:48.331 --> 00:06:48.681
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1190-0
00:06:48.691 --> 00:06:52.081
So the nature of these exams are
key, you know, varying.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1216-0
00:06:52.091 --> 00:06:55.711
I mean, last couple of years it
was offline, it was online, it

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1216-1
00:06:55.711 --> 00:06:59.215
was offline again it was closed
book, it was open book. Many

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1216-2
00:06:59.215 --> 00:06:59.961
combinations.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1223-0
00:06:59.971 --> 00:07:00.361
Yeah, it was.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1229-0
00:07:00.371 --> 00:07:02.041
For 40 marks, it was 30 marks.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1242-0
00:07:02.111 --> 00:07:03.961
So don't go with any of those.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1245-0
00:07:04.051 --> 00:07:05.901
You know, assumptions.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1253-0
00:07:05.911 --> 00:07:07.341
Just treat it as a plain
question.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1268-0
00:07:07.651 --> 00:07:10.561
Try to solve them and that would
be also helpful.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1274-0
00:07:10.571 --> 00:07:11.451
That will be our last step.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1276-0
00:07:12.301 --> 00:07:12.461
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1283-0
00:07:13.791 --> 00:07:14.821
Yeah, we will do that, Rishi.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1297-0
00:07:14.831 --> 00:07:16.865
Yeah, every class we have been
doing today as well, we'll do

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1297-1
00:07:16.865 --> 00:07:17.031
that.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1302-0
00:07:22.571 --> 00:07:22.781
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1310-0
00:07:22.791 --> 00:07:23.711
Is that clear for all of you?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1329-0
00:07:26.581 --> 00:07:29.671
Just two weeks prior exams, I
would and of course.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1338-0
00:07:29.681 --> 00:07:31.871
Uh, D3D will be the last exam.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1350-0
00:07:32.001 --> 00:07:34.871
Traditionally, that's been the
case this time as well.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1362-0
00:07:34.881 --> 00:07:37.011
I I am sure that will be the you
know case.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1378-0
00:07:38.091 --> 00:07:41.851
So after the last session, which
is uh, in Jan, I will upload uh.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1383-0
00:07:42.131 --> 00:07:44.031
The questions hope so.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1386-0
00:07:44.041 --> 00:07:45.171
I don't know why.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1398-0
00:07:45.211 --> 00:07:48.281
Uh, I see this chat bubbles
these days.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1410-0
00:07:49.121 --> 00:07:51.081
I have turned it off but still I
see it.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1430-0
00:07:54.401 --> 00:07:57.651
But no, the problem with sharing
it sooner is it'll create a lot

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1430-1
00:07:57.651 --> 00:07:58.301
of confusion.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1444-0
00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:00.971
Uh, because we have not covered
a lot of conflicts yet.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1459-0
00:08:01.381 --> 00:08:04.753
So and it will also put
unnecessary things into your

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1459-1
00:08:04.753 --> 00:08:05.071
mind.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1478-0
00:08:05.461 --> 00:08:09.449
So the right time would be after
we completed classes and don't

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1478-1
00:08:09.449 --> 00:08:10.881
take it very seriously.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1491-0
00:08:10.891 --> 00:08:13.751
There will be no questions
repeated and you know things

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1491-1
00:08:13.751 --> 00:08:14.261
like that.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1510-0
00:08:14.651 --> 00:08:18.186
So just treat it as yet another
paper and maybe solve it while

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1510-1
00:08:18.186 --> 00:08:18.691
you know.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1515-0
00:08:18.701 --> 00:08:19.331
Prepare for the exam.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1520-0
00:08:20.131 --> 00:08:20.371
Right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1538-0
00:08:21.631 --> 00:08:24.126
Don't give too much importance
to you know these sample paper

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1538-1
00:08:24.126 --> 00:08:25.091
sparse papers and so on.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1554-0
00:08:27.111 --> 00:08:29.983
As long as you have understood
the concept, you will enjoy

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1554-1
00:08:29.983 --> 00:08:31.151
writing the paper, yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1563-0
00:08:43.081 --> 00:08:43.591
Cool. I think.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1570-0
00:08:43.601 --> 00:08:45.141
Then let's get started.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1601-0
00:08:45.151 --> 00:08:48.859
So welcome to the 6th contact
session for data structures and

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1601-1
00:08:48.859 --> 00:08:52.626
algorithm design, and today we
will start a new topic which is

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1601-2
00:08:52.626 --> 00:08:54.061
the direction to graphs.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1618-0
00:08:54.451 --> 00:08:57.079
But before that, we will have a
recap of what we did in the last

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1618-1
00:08:57.079 --> 00:08:57.321
class.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1642-0
00:08:57.831 --> 00:09:00.796
We will also see one more
application of heaps which is

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1642-1
00:09:00.796 --> 00:09:04.131
called priority queues and after
this we will get started with

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1642-2
00:09:04.131 --> 00:09:04.501
graphs.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1672-0
00:09:04.511 --> 00:09:07.407
We will see what is a graph,
what are the types of graphs,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1672-1
00:09:07.407 --> 00:09:10.107
terminologies, how do you
represent a graph and so on,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1672-2
00:09:10.107 --> 00:09:10.401
right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1677-0
00:09:10.411 --> 00:09:10.801
We will do that.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1691-0
00:09:11.971 --> 00:09:14.700
So firstly, uh, how many of you
remember what we did in the last

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1691-1
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:14.951
class?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1697-0
00:09:16.901 --> 00:09:17.771
Yeah, real quick.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1702-0
00:09:17.781 --> 00:09:18.891
Do you remember what we did?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1712-0
00:09:21.221 --> 00:09:22.231
There are some hints here.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1714-0
00:09:22.321 --> 00:09:22.611
Right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1717-0
00:09:22.621 --> 00:09:24.791
Heaps parity cues?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1719-0
00:09:26.321 --> 00:09:26.591
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1727-0
00:09:26.601 --> 00:09:27.951
What exactly did we do in heaps?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1737-0
00:09:27.961 --> 00:09:30.151
Heap, heapsort, insertion,
deletion and heaps.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1744-0
00:09:30.481 --> 00:09:31.591
Yeah, heapify acation.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1757-0
00:09:31.601 --> 00:09:33.871
Yeah, a lot of you know,
interesting things we did.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1765-0
00:09:35.141 --> 00:09:36.111
So what did we really do?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1797-0
00:09:36.541 --> 00:09:40.139
So we started with what is the
heap and it's types and we got

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1797-1
00:09:40.139 --> 00:09:43.271
it very clear that there are
only two types of heaps.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1812-0
00:09:43.741 --> 00:09:46.851
Yeah, there is a Max heap or
there is a min heap.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1815-0
00:09:46.861 --> 00:09:47.651
It cannot be both.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1837-0
00:09:48.031 --> 00:09:51.385
Yeah, it is either a Max heap or
a min heap or it is not a heap

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1837-1
00:09:51.385 --> 00:09:51.751
at all.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1841-0
00:09:52.341 --> 00:09:52.721
Cool.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1847-0
00:09:52.901 --> 00:09:54.381
And what is a heap?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1859-0
00:09:54.441 --> 00:09:56.760
It is a tree based data
structure which has two

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1859-1
00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:57.291
properties.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1875-0
00:09:57.781 --> 00:10:00.031
One is the shape property and
one is the heap property.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1895-0
00:10:01.631 --> 00:10:04.442
The shape property means firstly
it should be a complete binary

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1895-1
00:10:04.442 --> 00:10:04.661
tree.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1911-0
00:10:05.051 --> 00:10:08.160
If it is not a complete binary
tree, there is no point in

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1911-1
00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.231
talking about heaps.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1927-0
00:10:09.241 --> 00:10:10.811
You can right away tell this is
not a heap.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1955-0
00:10:11.711 --> 00:10:15.678
If it is a complete binary tree,
then it can either be a min heap

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/1955-1
00:10:15.678 --> 00:10:17.901
or a Max heap, or not a heap at
all.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2011-0
00:10:18.421 --> 00:10:21.762
If it's a min heap like this,
you know that for every parent

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2011-1
00:10:21.762 --> 00:10:25.322
child relationship the parent to
smaller than the children right

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2011-2
00:10:25.322 --> 00:10:28.608
one is smaller than four and
12:12 is smaller than the team

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2011-3
00:10:28.608 --> 00:10:32.003
four is smaller than five and
10, and so one for every parent

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2011-4
00:10:32.003 --> 00:10:32.331
child.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2052-0
00:10:32.341 --> 00:10:36.109
They should hold true, but as in
Max, the parent will be greater

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2052-1
00:10:36.109 --> 00:10:39.761
than its children, 9 is greater
than 7966, is greater than 37,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2052-2
00:10:39.761 --> 00:10:42.601
is greater than four than two,
and so on, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2060-0
00:10:42.911 --> 00:10:44.401
And how do you represent a heap?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2091-0
00:10:44.631 --> 00:10:47.741
Since it's always a complete
binary tree, you can just use an

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2091-1
00:10:47.741 --> 00:10:50.901
array based representation where
you will start the route from

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2091-2
00:10:50.901 --> 00:10:51.101
one.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2102-0
00:10:51.391 --> 00:10:53.521
It's child is 23456 and so on.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2113-0
00:10:54.011 --> 00:10:55.481
So we learned about what is the
min heap.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2124-0
00:10:55.491 --> 00:10:56.191
What is a Max heap?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2137-0
00:10:57.451 --> 00:11:01.152
Then we learned term called
hippie fication, which is an

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2137-1
00:11:01.152 --> 00:11:02.061
umbrella name.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2145-0
00:11:02.071 --> 00:11:03.341
Yeah, don't get confused at all.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2160-0
00:11:03.351 --> 00:11:05.931
There's a lot of jargons here,
but it's very simple.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2172-0
00:11:07.131 --> 00:11:09.901
Actual concept, yeah, I fication
is just a name.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2175-0
00:11:10.111 --> 00:11:10.381
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2181-0
00:11:10.391 --> 00:11:11.661
What is that really mean?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2206-0
00:11:12.171 --> 00:11:16.295
It's simply means you are given
a complete binary tree, but it

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2206-1
00:11:16.295 --> 00:11:19.371
is not a heap, but you want to
make it a heap.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2218-0
00:11:19.721 --> 00:11:22.111
Yeah, maybe you want to make it
a Max heap.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2229-0
00:11:23.131 --> 00:11:25.621
Then you will apply something
called as Max CP5.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2236-0
00:11:26.911 --> 00:11:28.161
Let's say you want a min heap.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2254-0
00:11:28.251 --> 00:11:31.918
You will apply Min Heapify and
as a result what you get will be

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2254-1
00:11:31.918 --> 00:11:32.261
a Max.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2282-0
00:11:32.271 --> 00:11:37.016
See forum in heap and this whole
process of converting a non heap

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2282-1
00:11:37.016 --> 00:11:40.251
into a heap that is called as
epic fication.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2284-0
00:11:41.351 --> 00:11:41.541
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2293-0
00:11:41.551 --> 00:11:42.511
Is this clear for all of you?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2312-0
00:11:43.991 --> 00:11:47.426
Yeah, I saw some discussion also
on, you know, if fiction

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2312-1
00:11:47.426 --> 00:11:48.551
bubbling and so on.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2314-0
00:11:49.441 --> 00:11:49.791
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2324-0
00:11:49.841 --> 00:11:51.241
So I ping to make Maxwell
Mathew.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2328-0
00:11:51.251 --> 00:11:51.861
Exactly right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2338-0
00:11:51.871 --> 00:11:53.561
Time complexity of min heap is
1.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2344-0
00:11:53.571 --> 00:11:54.871
Max Heap is log in.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2350-0
00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:55.411
No, no, no.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2361-0
00:11:55.421 --> 00:11:58.491
It's all the same, so it is log
in right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2382-0
00:11:59.081 --> 00:12:03.464
So just fetching the root is
actually we go off one that is

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2382-1
00:12:03.464 --> 00:12:04.121
for both.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2385-0
00:12:04.981 --> 00:12:05.951
We need power, Maxim.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2421-0
00:12:05.961 --> 00:12:09.488
You're directly going and taking
the first element that is a

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2421-1
00:12:09.488 --> 00:12:12.551
constant, whereas any other
search Oregon insertion,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2421-2
00:12:12.551 --> 00:12:15.441
deletion, et cetera are log in
in both the cases.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2423-0
00:12:16.511 --> 00:12:16.751
Yep.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2434-0
00:12:18.171 --> 00:12:21.001
And then we started looking at
building a heap, right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2441-0
00:12:21.011 --> 00:12:22.041
How do you build a heap?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2446-0
00:12:22.191 --> 00:12:23.321
There were two techniques.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2493-0
00:12:23.331 --> 00:12:26.873
One is using bottom up approach
using appropriate typification,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2493-1
00:12:26.873 --> 00:12:30.360
meaning if we are given the list
of numbers and if we are told

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2493-2
00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:33.846
create a heap, what we can do is
we can just create a complete

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2493-3
00:12:33.846 --> 00:12:35.561
binary tree out of it randomly.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2520-0
00:12:35.571 --> 00:12:39.655
Just create a complete binary
tree and then start performing

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2520-1
00:12:39.655 --> 00:12:43.001
either Max CP5 or min EP5 based
on what you want.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2535-0
00:12:43.441 --> 00:12:45.731
If you want a Max heap, you will
apply Max CP5.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2562-0
00:12:45.941 --> 00:12:49.944
If you want a min heap, you will
apply min heap P5, meaning you

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2562-1
00:12:49.944 --> 00:12:52.821
can build a heap using heapify
ication right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2592-0
00:12:52.831 --> 00:12:56.147
That is 1 technique or you can
use repetitive insertion,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2592-1
00:12:56.147 --> 00:12:59.579
meaning you add one element
immediately you try to swap it

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2592-2
00:12:59.579 --> 00:13:01.731
and make it as a heap that you
want.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2612-0
00:13:01.811 --> 00:13:05.324
Let's say Max Heap again, third
element you insert, you see if

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2612-1
00:13:05.324 --> 00:13:06.271
it is a Max heap.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2624-0
00:13:06.341 --> 00:13:09.251
If it is not immediately, you
swap and make it a Max heap.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2656-0
00:13:09.321 --> 00:13:12.718
So like that you keep doing
after every insertion, so that

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2656-1
00:13:12.718 --> 00:13:15.941
is also another way to build a
heap and then insertion.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2671-0
00:13:16.411 --> 00:13:18.807
We saw that, you know, you
cannot just randomly insert

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2671-1
00:13:18.807 --> 00:13:19.591
anywhere you like.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2685-0
00:13:20.541 --> 00:13:23.411
So what is the criteria that you
need to keep in mind?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2687-0
00:13:23.961 --> 00:13:24.501
You remember that?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2705-0
00:13:26.631 --> 00:13:29.519
So for example, in this tree,
where is the only place where I

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2705-1
00:13:29.519 --> 00:13:30.031
can insert?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2709-0
00:13:32.261 --> 00:13:32.901
Yeah, real quick.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2720-0
00:13:34.951 --> 00:13:36.701
Because I'll have to know root
is wrong.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2732-0
00:13:36.711 --> 00:13:38.841
What is the only place where I
can insert?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2740-0
00:13:38.911 --> 00:13:40.461
Yeah, we are not talking about
delete.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2747-0
00:13:40.791 --> 00:13:41.781
Yeah, the last leaf.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2766-0
00:13:41.791 --> 00:13:45.991
Where is that the right side of
12, right, right side of 12 is

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2766-1
00:13:45.991 --> 00:13:47.591
the only correct answer.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2781-0
00:13:47.601 --> 00:13:51.367
You cannot insert left or right
of five left or right of 10

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2781-1
00:13:51.367 --> 00:13:51.931
etcetera.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2784-0
00:13:52.061 --> 00:13:52.671
Why?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2803-0
00:13:52.741 --> 00:13:56.594
The reason is that we should
still maintain it to to be a

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2803-1
00:13:56.594 --> 00:13:58.321
complete binary tree fate.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2849-0
00:13:58.371 --> 00:14:02.055
So if you draw to the right side
of 12, any number that is still

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2849-1
00:14:02.055 --> 00:14:05.738
a complete binary tree, whereas
if you add it to as the children

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2849-2
00:14:05.738 --> 00:14:08.741
of 510 or 13, then it is not a
complete binary tree.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2860-0
00:14:09.911 --> 00:14:12.461
So this position was called a
zit, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2865-0
00:14:12.471 --> 00:14:13.921
Z is an insertion position.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2883-0
00:14:14.681 --> 00:14:18.191
You will find such a way that it
still is a complete binary tree.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2904-0
00:14:18.461 --> 00:14:23.294
You will go ahead and insert it,
but the moment you insert it, it

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2904-1
00:14:23.294 --> 00:14:25.271
might not be a heap, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2909-0
00:14:25.321 --> 00:14:26.231
Simple policy.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2928-0
00:14:26.611 --> 00:14:30.306
If this is a min heap after my
insertion also it should be a

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2928-1
00:14:30.306 --> 00:14:30.851
min heap.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2938-0
00:14:30.921 --> 00:14:32.771
I should ensure that it is a min
heap.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2954-0
00:14:33.221 --> 00:14:37.323
But let's say suppose I'm going
to insert an element here which

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2954-1
00:14:37.323 --> 00:14:37.771
is 0.5.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2960-0
00:14:38.301 --> 00:14:39.351
Yeah, that's also valid.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2966-0
00:14:39.361 --> 00:14:40.251
Yeah, it's .5.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2977-0
00:14:40.801 --> 00:14:43.751
I've added it here the moment
I've added it.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2996-0
00:14:45.121 --> 00:14:50.280
Will it be a min heap 12 will be
greater than .5 then this is

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/2996-1
00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:51.611
violating right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3005-0
00:14:51.621 --> 00:14:53.071
So this will not be a min heap.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3014-0
00:14:53.231 --> 00:14:54.191
So what I should be doing?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3068-0
00:14:54.201 --> 00:14:57.799
I should again be doing the same
thing, swapping right, but in

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3068-1
00:14:57.799 --> 00:15:01.111
this case when I'm doing
insertion, that's swapping has a

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3068-2
00:15:01.111 --> 00:15:04.709
special name and that is what is
called a peep bubbly, meaning

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3068-3
00:15:04.709 --> 00:15:08.249
this guy who got inserted at the
bottom, he bubbles up to his

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3068-4
00:15:08.249 --> 00:15:08.991
proper place.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3086-0
00:15:09.561 --> 00:15:12.288
Yeah, he goes up to his proper
place, meaning .5 will

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3086-1
00:15:12.288 --> 00:15:13.651
eventually become the root.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3098-0
00:15:13.961 --> 00:15:16.131
And it's children will be, you
know, others.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3105-0
00:15:16.661 --> 00:15:19.111
So that is called API bubbling
and deletion.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3126-0
00:15:19.121 --> 00:15:22.685
What is the only element that
you can delete which is the

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3126-1
00:15:22.685 --> 00:15:23.791
root, but they're?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3144-0
00:15:23.801 --> 00:15:26.417
Also, we learned a lot of
interesting concepts that if you

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3144-1
00:15:26.417 --> 00:15:28.501
just delete the route, what will
happen there?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3153-0
00:15:28.511 --> 00:15:30.461
I mean this whole tree will
become disjointed.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3159-0
00:15:30.471 --> 00:15:31.421
They'll become an orphan.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3173-0
00:15:31.971 --> 00:15:34.541
So you should take the last leaf
and put him there.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3190-0
00:15:35.551 --> 00:15:38.882
And if you do so almost, it is
very certain that it will

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3190-1
00:15:38.882 --> 00:15:40.401
violate the heap property.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3195-0
00:15:40.911 --> 00:15:42.141
Just think logically, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3217-0
00:15:42.411 --> 00:15:45.931
So if this is a Max heap, the
largest element will be on the

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3217-1
00:15:45.931 --> 00:15:46.161
top.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3248-0
00:15:47.171 --> 00:15:50.676
These smaller elements will be
somewhere in the bottom and if

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3248-1
00:15:50.676 --> 00:15:53.729
you delete this route and
randomly put this last leaf

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3248-2
00:15:53.729 --> 00:15:56.611
there, definitely it will not be
a Max heap right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3257-0
00:15:56.621 --> 00:15:57.751
It'll violate the property.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3275-0
00:15:57.801 --> 00:16:00.316
This three if it goes up, it
will not be greater than seven

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3275-1
00:16:00.316 --> 00:16:00.651
and six.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3314-0
00:16:01.951 --> 00:16:05.488
So in that case, again you will
perform swaps, so that is why

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3314-1
00:16:05.488 --> 00:16:09.138
this is called down heap public
meaning this node which went on

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3314-2
00:16:09.138 --> 00:16:12.389
top to the root, it will again
bubble down to its proper

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3314-3
00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:13.301
position, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3336-0
00:16:13.611 --> 00:16:16.215
That is pretty much about
deletion, and then we also

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3336-1
00:16:16.215 --> 00:16:18.621
learned about one application
which is heapsort.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3340-0
00:16:18.951 --> 00:16:19.401
Heapsort.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3343-0
00:16:19.411 --> 00:16:20.301
Very simple.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3349-0
00:16:20.631 --> 00:16:21.781
It had two phases.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3362-0
00:16:22.201 --> 00:16:25.791
Whatever numbers are given,
create a heap and then delete

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3362-1
00:16:25.791 --> 00:16:26.471
everything.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3377-0
00:16:27.111 --> 00:16:30.911
What you get as a result is a
sorted order, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3385-0
00:16:32.051 --> 00:16:33.451
You're a couple of questions
will be asked.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3409-0
00:16:33.461 --> 00:16:36.090
Which one is good immediate
reapplication while insertion or

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3409-1
00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:38.201
doing reapplication at last
after making binary?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3411-0
00:16:38.271 --> 00:16:39.101
Very good question.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3430-0
00:16:39.371 --> 00:16:42.465
So if you see here, we had
learned the complexity of both

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3430-1
00:16:42.465 --> 00:16:43.211
of them right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3439-0
00:16:44.241 --> 00:16:46.891
The first one is big of yen,
right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3557-0
00:16:46.901 --> 00:16:50.696
You remember it was log and so
on, but we also told you can do

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3557-1
00:16:50.696 --> 00:16:54.249
amortized analysis and we
convince ourselves that whatever

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3557-2
00:16:54.249 --> 00:16:57.983
numbers are given, if you just
create it as a complete binary

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3557-3
00:16:57.983 --> 00:17:01.958
tree and perform hippie fication
that is this technique bottom up

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3557-4
00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:05.813
technique, the complexity would
be be go of yen whereas in this

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3557-5
00:17:05.813 --> 00:17:09.125
repetitive insertion the
complexity will be and log in

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3557-6
00:17:09.125 --> 00:17:12.799
right because log N is nothing
but for insertion and you are

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3557-7
00:17:12.799 --> 00:17:16.413
inserting an elements and the
two repetitive every time you

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3557-8
00:17:16.413 --> 00:17:20.027
are checking if it is a heap or
not heap or not and you are

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3557-9
00:17:20.027 --> 00:17:21.291
trying to correct it.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3566-0
00:17:22.381 --> 00:17:23.971
So this is more costly, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3585-0
00:17:23.981 --> 00:17:27.731
Repetitive insertion method is
more costly to create a heap

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3585-1
00:17:27.731 --> 00:17:29.481
than the bottom up approach.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3601-0
00:17:30.681 --> 00:17:33.381
Pull parallel insert or delete
may not be possible in

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3601-1
00:17:33.381 --> 00:17:34.531
application using heap.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3606-0
00:17:34.541 --> 00:17:35.611
No, it is not possible.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3641-0
00:17:35.621 --> 00:17:38.899
Yeah, one after the other
sequentially, only you have to

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3641-1
00:17:38.899 --> 00:17:42.579
upload or I mean add and after
adding you have to check if that

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3641-2
00:17:42.579 --> 00:17:43.901
is still a heap or not.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3651-0
00:17:44.161 --> 00:17:46.611
If it is not, you have to
immediately correct it.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3664-0
00:17:47.141 --> 00:17:49.741
So parallelly, if you want to do
then there can be confusion.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3675-0
00:17:49.751 --> 00:17:52.391
There can be race conditions,
you know, things like that.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3679-0
00:17:54.231 --> 00:17:54.391
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3698-0
00:17:55.521 --> 00:17:58.279
So in this whole course, most
data structures that we see

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3698-1
00:17:58.279 --> 00:18:00.371
would be sequential data
structures, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3719-0
00:18:00.381 --> 00:18:03.604
They are not suitable for, you
know, streaming data or you're

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3719-1
00:18:03.604 --> 00:18:05.891
constantly getting some data
from a sensor.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3735-0
00:18:06.301 --> 00:18:09.588
How do you store it so such data
structures are not in this

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3735-1
00:18:09.588 --> 00:18:09.971
course?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3757-0
00:18:09.981 --> 00:18:13.147
Yeah, you will learn it in ML
and other courses when you go to

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3757-1
00:18:13.147 --> 00:18:14.101
the next semesters.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3764-0
00:18:14.941 --> 00:18:16.891
Yeah, so far, so good.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3767-0
00:18:16.901 --> 00:18:18.681
All of you heaps, yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3770-0
00:18:20.621 --> 00:18:20.921
Yes.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3772-0
00:18:20.931 --> 00:18:21.091
No.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3787-0
00:18:21.101 --> 00:18:23.431
Maybe what is the heap types of
it?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3816-0
00:18:23.441 --> 00:18:27.771
Hippie fication building a heap
insertion and deletion, as well

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3816-1
00:18:27.771 --> 00:18:31.491
as the application of heat,
which is heap sort, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3833-0
00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:35.126
I would again and again as you
please practice those exercises

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3833-1
00:18:35.126 --> 00:18:36.421
and watch the recordings.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3839-0
00:18:36.431 --> 00:18:36.611
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3862-0
00:18:36.621 --> 00:18:39.343
These are all very simple
concepts, but there are a lot of

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3862-1
00:18:39.343 --> 00:18:41.511
jargons involved, so it might be
overwhelming.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3880-0
00:18:41.521 --> 00:18:44.248
So what's the recordings and
follow along and then it will be

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3880-1
00:18:44.248 --> 00:18:44.951
even more clear.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3903-0
00:18:45.461 --> 00:18:48.766
Yeah, we'll have a look at the
second application and then we

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3903-1
00:18:48.766 --> 00:18:51.431
will go to the next data
structure called graphs.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3910-0
00:18:52.551 --> 00:18:54.181
So what does this priority
queue?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3930-0
00:18:54.231 --> 00:18:56.929
Yeah, it is an application of
heap, but have we already

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3930-1
00:18:56.929 --> 00:18:58.181
learned what is the queue?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3938-0
00:18:59.121 --> 00:19:00.371
And if you remember what is the
queue?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3943-0
00:19:02.221 --> 00:19:03.501
What paradigm does it follow?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3969-0
00:19:05.851 --> 00:19:09.083
Is it last in, first out or is
it first in, first out or yeah

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3969-1
00:19:09.083 --> 00:19:10.021
it is FIFO, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3975-0
00:19:10.031 --> 00:19:10.741
Similar is right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/3987-0
00:19:10.931 --> 00:19:13.161
The first element which goes in
will be the first element.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4009-0
00:19:13.171 --> 00:19:17.044
To get out that banq example and
the tall example and all that we

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4009-1
00:19:17.044 --> 00:19:18.041
have taken right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4043-0
00:19:18.171 --> 00:19:21.153
So that doesn't normal queue and
we are also seen about what is

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4043-1
00:19:21.153 --> 00:19:23.995
the circular queue where you
know after the last element you

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4043-2
00:19:23.995 --> 00:19:26.091
again point back to the first
one and so on.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4056-0
00:19:26.241 --> 00:19:29.545
We learned about all that, but
now what does this priority

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4056-1
00:19:29.545 --> 00:19:29.881
queue?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4072-0
00:19:30.911 --> 00:19:33.561
So priority queue is a data
structure for maintaining a set.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4083-0
00:19:33.571 --> 00:19:37.582
Yes, of elements, each with an
associated value called a key or

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4083-1
00:19:37.582 --> 00:19:38.271
a priority.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4085-0
00:19:39.221 --> 00:19:39.541
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4121-0
00:19:39.581 --> 00:19:42.691
So you can call it so each
element in that data structure

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4121-1
00:19:42.691 --> 00:19:45.800
and now is not just the element,
it is also going to have

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4121-2
00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:48.641
something associated with it,
which is its priority.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4133-0
00:19:48.981 --> 00:19:50.411
You can call it as key or
priority.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4140-0
00:19:50.421 --> 00:19:52.131
I would prefer to call it as
priority.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4149-0
00:19:52.721 --> 00:19:53.741
Yeah, across my slides.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4160-0
00:19:53.751 --> 00:19:56.321
Whenever I'm talking, I'll talk
in terms of priority.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4202-0
00:19:57.741 --> 00:20:01.413
So the moment you now talk about
this priority, there is no real

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4202-1
00:20:01.413 --> 00:20:04.520
fee for rule anymore, meaning
now the whole insertion,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4202-2
00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:07.910
removal, all that will not
happen based on first come first

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4202-3
00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:09.491
serve or first in first out.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4216-0
00:20:09.941 --> 00:20:12.791
Yeah, it will happen based on
the priority of each element.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4225-0
00:20:13.811 --> 00:20:15.341
Yeah, there are two kinds now.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4241-0
00:20:15.351 --> 00:20:19.168
Again, Max priority queue and
min priority queue according to

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4241-1
00:20:19.168 --> 00:20:20.091
Max 7 min heap.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4283-0
00:20:20.881 --> 00:20:24.365
So if you use a Max heap and
create a priority queue that is

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4283-1
00:20:24.365 --> 00:20:27.848
called as a Max priority queue
and if you use a min heap and

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4283-2
00:20:27.848 --> 00:20:31.331
create a priority queue that is
called a min priority queue.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4293-0
00:20:33.301 --> 00:20:34.501
And the key denotes the
priority.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4310-0
00:20:35.581 --> 00:20:38.289
So firstly, we will take an
example of why we should use

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4310-1
00:20:38.289 --> 00:20:38.811
this right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4319-0
00:20:38.821 --> 00:20:40.471
So what is the Max priority
application?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4328-0
00:20:40.481 --> 00:20:41.811
And then we'll go back to that
slide.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4331-0
00:20:41.921 --> 00:20:42.411
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4355-0
00:20:42.581 --> 00:20:45.843
So have you all done a course on
operating systems or have a fair

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4355-1
00:20:45.843 --> 00:20:47.671
idea how our operating systems
work?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4358-0
00:20:49.801 --> 00:20:50.111
Yes.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4360-0
00:20:50.121 --> 00:20:50.501
No, maybe.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4385-0
00:20:52.441 --> 00:20:56.036
It can be Windows, Linux, Mac OS
or whatever, but a general idea

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4385-1
00:20:56.036 --> 00:20:57.971
of how our operating systems
work.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4387-0
00:20:58.101 --> 00:20:58.271
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4395-0
00:20:58.281 --> 00:20:58.961
Do you have some idea?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4403-0
00:21:00.451 --> 00:21:02.201
He also real quick. Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4410-0
00:21:02.211 --> 00:21:03.161
So you have CPU.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4418-0
00:21:03.171 --> 00:21:04.621
Let's assume I'm a poor guy.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4427-0
00:21:04.631 --> 00:21:06.541
I just have a CPU, one CPU.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4444-0
00:21:06.551 --> 00:21:09.756
Yeah, I'm not using some
advanced, you know, laptops with

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4444-1
00:21:09.756 --> 00:21:10.861
multicore and so on.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4461-0
00:21:11.271 --> 00:21:15.117
I have just one CPU and there
are many jobs in my computer,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4461-1
00:21:15.117 --> 00:21:15.501
right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4476-0
00:21:15.511 --> 00:21:20.241
For example, I have my MS Teams
open and I have my browser open.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4484-0
00:21:20.251 --> 00:21:21.641
I have files open.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4502-0
00:21:21.681 --> 00:21:25.221
Many of these are programs, and
in OS terms it's called less

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4502-1
00:21:25.221 --> 00:21:25.801
processes.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4510-0
00:21:26.801 --> 00:21:28.611
I'm running multiple of these
things right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4517-0
00:21:28.621 --> 00:21:29.631
They're all in the queue.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4524-0
00:21:30.661 --> 00:21:32.271
They're all in the Reddy queue.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4561-0
00:21:32.721 --> 00:21:36.754
OK, so there are many concepts,
so let's not go into operating

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4561-1
00:21:36.754 --> 00:21:40.787
systems, but I'm trying to just
tell you that even if you have

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4561-2
00:21:40.787 --> 00:21:43.091
one CPU, you can run multiple
jobs.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4565-0
00:21:43.581 --> 00:21:43.931
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4580-0
00:21:43.941 --> 00:21:48.091
Meaning it cannot run parallelly
at the very same time unit.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4616-0
00:21:48.161 --> 00:21:51.902
They will not be running, but
they'll quickly switch between

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4616-1
00:21:51.902 --> 00:21:55.581
them and it is so fast that for
a human eye it will seem as

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4616-2
00:21:55.581 --> 00:21:57.911
though all of them are running
right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4626-0
00:21:58.091 --> 00:22:00.851
For example, PPT will run within
a microsecond.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4651-0
00:22:00.861 --> 00:22:03.404
Again, it will switch to MS
Teams and then it will switch to

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4651-1
00:22:03.404 --> 00:22:05.321
browser and so on and it will
keep happening.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4669-0
00:22:05.411 --> 00:22:07.798
This is called context
switching, so all this the

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4669-1
00:22:07.798 --> 00:22:09.421
operating system does it for
you.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4694-0
00:22:09.651 --> 00:22:14.480
But this Reddy queue this has a
lot of jobs now and this Reddy

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4694-1
00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:18.311
queue can be implemented as a
Max priority queue.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4711-0
00:22:19.051 --> 00:22:23.687
Meaning the higher priority jobs
will get the CPU 1st and then

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4711-1
00:22:23.687 --> 00:22:25.011
they will execute.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4731-0
00:22:25.081 --> 00:22:27.500
They will either get swapped
out, maybe they want to print

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4731-1
00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:28.771
something or they want some IU.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4734-0
00:22:28.781 --> 00:22:29.511
They will go out.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4751-0
00:22:29.741 --> 00:22:32.237
They'll wait for that to happen
and they'll again join back the

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4751-1
00:22:32.237 --> 00:22:32.471
queue.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4764-0
00:22:32.761 --> 00:22:35.730
Or if they have completed it,
they will go ahead and exit,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4764-1
00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:36.031
right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4777-0
00:22:36.041 --> 00:22:39.091
They they are completed and they
will just exit the system.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4792-0
00:22:39.621 --> 00:22:43.701
So now this queue is behaving as
a priority queue.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4806-0
00:22:43.711 --> 00:22:48.676
Meaning, if there are five jobs,
I should go ahead and pick that

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4806-1
00:22:48.676 --> 00:22:48.981
job.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4815-0
00:22:48.991 --> 00:22:51.701
Who's very important or having a
maximum priority?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4838-0
00:22:52.071 --> 00:22:55.216
So this short term scheduler is
a guy who picks up jobs from

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4838-1
00:22:55.216 --> 00:22:57.071
this queue and gives it to the
CPU.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4841-0
00:22:58.241 --> 00:22:58.761
Got it right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4857-0
00:22:58.771 --> 00:23:02.031
So there are many jobs here and
the CPU is now free.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4880-0
00:23:02.861 --> 00:23:06.425
This short term scheduler is the
guy who will decide which job

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4880-1
00:23:06.425 --> 00:23:08.631
should go and execute in the CPU
next.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4887-0
00:23:09.081 --> 00:23:11.331
But say there are 10 jobs here,
right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4904-0
00:23:11.341 --> 00:23:13.761
I should pick one among those 10
and give it to the CPU.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4912-0
00:23:14.521 --> 00:23:15.671
But which one do I pick?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4920-0
00:23:15.941 --> 00:23:17.951
If it's a normal queue, which
one will get picked?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4922-0
00:23:19.821 --> 00:23:20.001
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4932-0
00:23:21.971 --> 00:23:24.311
Real quick, guys, all of you
just focus, yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4943-0
00:23:26.711 --> 00:23:28.571
These are all just applications
I'm talking about.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4950-0
00:23:28.581 --> 00:23:30.331
Amit, please watch the recording
again.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4952-0
00:23:30.341 --> 00:23:30.811
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4955-0
00:23:30.881 --> 00:23:31.511
Yeah, exactly.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4979-0
00:23:31.521 --> 00:23:34.024
If it was first come, first
serve, the first job will come

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/4979-1
00:23:34.024 --> 00:23:35.211
and get executed in the CPU.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5006-0
00:23:35.321 --> 00:23:39.068
But I don't want that because in
my laptop or in all our laptops

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5006-1
00:23:39.068 --> 00:23:41.431
it is not always first come
first serve.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5020-0
00:23:41.441 --> 00:23:44.265
There may be some higher
priority job which needs to be

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5020-1
00:23:44.265 --> 00:23:45.021
executed right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5036-0
00:23:45.031 --> 00:23:48.431
For example, say my laptop's
power is going, you know low.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5055-0
00:23:48.441 --> 00:23:52.047
Low then definitely I need a pop
up in my screen telling that you

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5055-1
00:23:52.047 --> 00:23:53.631
know your power is going low.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5081-0
00:23:53.641 --> 00:23:56.790
Please, you know, put it in
charge so that type of a job

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5081-1
00:23:56.790 --> 00:24:00.270
that becomes more priority to
me, right, it has to be executed

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5081-2
00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:00.491
now.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5101-0
00:24:02.211 --> 00:24:06.064
So the whole job scheduling in
your laptops happen based on

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5101-1
00:24:06.064 --> 00:24:06.641
priority.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5110-0
00:24:07.821 --> 00:24:09.861
Is this concept clear for all of
you, Amit? Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5127-0
00:24:11.041 --> 00:24:14.043
So I I made a lot of, you know,
other stories, but that is the

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5127-1
00:24:14.043 --> 00:24:14.281
crux.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5139-0
00:24:14.331 --> 00:24:18.751
Yeah, our laptops scheduling
happen based on priorities.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5154-0
00:24:18.841 --> 00:24:21.433
Yeah, there are many other
scheduling also like round

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5154-1
00:24:21.433 --> 00:24:21.721
Robin.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5170-0
00:24:21.731 --> 00:24:24.251
There's that, but let's not go
too deep into all that.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5180-0
00:24:24.701 --> 00:24:28.091
But here using a normal queue is
not a good idea.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5210-0
00:24:28.441 --> 00:24:31.244
Yeah, if you use a normal queue
then what would happen is just

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5210-1
00:24:31.244 --> 00:24:34.136
jobs will keep coming and based
on the order they came they will

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5210-2
00:24:34.136 --> 00:24:34.491
execute.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5215-0
00:24:34.981 --> 00:24:35.991
But we don't want that.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5241-0
00:24:36.421 --> 00:24:40.968
Yeah, we want jobs which are of
higher priority to execute 1st

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5241-1
00:24:40.968 --> 00:24:45.081
and that is when I can use the
Max priority queue right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5271-0
00:24:45.491 --> 00:24:48.688
So if you again go back to the
slide, job scheduling on shared

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5271-1
00:24:48.688 --> 00:24:51.682
computer jobs have priorities
are stored in a Max priority

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5271-2
00:24:51.682 --> 00:24:52.341
queue, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5290-0
00:24:53.011 --> 00:24:56.807
Each time a new job is to be
scheduled, it's got to be one of

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5290-1
00:24:56.807 --> 00:24:58.521
the highest priority, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5307-0
00:24:58.861 --> 00:25:02.052
But how it is a queue then as it
can nullify the concept of

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5307-1
00:25:02.052 --> 00:25:02.371
queue.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5315-0
00:25:02.381 --> 00:25:03.971
Yeah, this is called a priority
queue.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5340-0
00:25:03.981 --> 00:25:07.401
Yeah, so this is not a normal
queue, correct the the the

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5340-1
00:25:07.401 --> 00:25:09.981
normal fee four thing is the
actual queue.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5352-0
00:25:10.251 --> 00:25:13.421
So here you can imagine it to be
a Max priority queue.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5367-0
00:25:13.471 --> 00:25:16.639
You are again calling it queue
because it is a linear data

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5367-1
00:25:16.639 --> 00:25:17.551
structure, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5386-0
00:25:17.651 --> 00:25:20.953
And it has the similar concepts
of N queuing, dequeuing and all

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5386-1
00:25:20.953 --> 00:25:21.211
that.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5407-0
00:25:22.171 --> 00:25:25.757
But you are right, you cannot
actually call this as a normal

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5407-1
00:25:25.757 --> 00:25:26.991
queue or FIFO, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5441-0
00:25:27.041 --> 00:25:30.612
This is a special type of a
queue, so each time a new job

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5441-1
00:25:30.612 --> 00:25:34.613
has to be scheduled, it's got to
be one of the highest priority,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5441-2
00:25:34.613 --> 00:25:36.521
highest priority in a Max heap.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5447-0
00:25:36.571 --> 00:25:38.051
Where will that highest priority
be?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5452-0
00:25:39.911 --> 00:25:40.321
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5470-0
00:25:40.371 --> 00:25:43.797
Yes, try to remember if you have
a Max heap, where will the

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5470-1
00:25:43.797 --> 00:25:44.881
largest element be?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5476-0
00:25:44.891 --> 00:25:46.901
Yeah, very good root, right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5511-0
00:25:47.371 --> 00:25:52.415
So if I implement a Max priority
queue using a Max heap, then the

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5511-1
00:25:52.415 --> 00:25:57.382
largest or the highest priority
one will be the first element or

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5511-2
00:25:57.382 --> 00:25:58.681
the root element.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5527-0
00:25:59.191 --> 00:26:03.258
So always I can just pick that
one and give it to the CPU,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5527-1
00:26:03.258 --> 00:26:03.671
right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5538-0
00:26:04.681 --> 00:26:07.939
And new jobs can be inserted
using the insert operation,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5538-1
00:26:07.939 --> 00:26:08.281
right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5561-0
00:26:08.291 --> 00:26:11.446
This is exactly, you know, our
insert operation in a heap in

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5561-1
00:26:11.446 --> 00:26:14.341
order to avoid starvation,
priorities can be increased.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5565-0
00:26:14.691 --> 00:26:14.921
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5585-0
00:26:14.931 --> 00:26:17.780
Again, this is another concept
and operating system where we

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5585-1
00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:20.161
just spoke about this priorities
and so on, right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5588-0
00:26:21.051 --> 00:26:22.151
For example, there is this.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5613-0
00:26:24.051 --> 00:26:28.589
B1P2P3P4P5 all of these, and
they all have associated

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5613-1
00:26:28.589 --> 00:26:30.101
priorities, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5624-0
00:26:30.111 --> 00:26:33.201
For example, this is of priority
10 is of priority eight.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5631-0
00:26:33.261 --> 00:26:34.401
This is of say 9.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5635-0
00:26:34.691 --> 00:26:35.611
This is of seven.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5646-0
00:26:35.691 --> 00:26:37.691
This is of, you know, 11 and so
on.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5658-0
00:26:39.061 --> 00:26:42.851
So at this stage, who will be
the one who will get executed?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5674-0
00:26:44.281 --> 00:26:47.833
I'm talking about Max priority
queue, meaning the process with

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5674-1
00:26:47.833 --> 00:26:49.411
the highest priority, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5695-0
00:26:49.421 --> 00:26:52.886
So P1 will execute, then P5 will
execute, then P3 will execute

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5695-1
00:26:52.886 --> 00:26:53.821
and so on. Right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5701-0
00:26:53.831 --> 00:26:54.931
Let's let's assume this.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5703-0
00:26:55.261 --> 00:26:55.471
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5734-0
00:26:56.941 --> 00:26:59.584
And let's say this guy executed
this guy executed and at that

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5734-1
00:26:59.584 --> 00:27:02.184
time there is a P6 coming and
he's coming with a priority of

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5734-2
00:27:02.184 --> 00:27:02.311
12.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5747-0
00:27:03.971 --> 00:27:07.255
So at this time, who will
execute be when already

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5747-1
00:27:07.255 --> 00:27:07.911
completed?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5787-0
00:27:08.821 --> 00:27:13.037
If I already completed and now
it was the chance for P3, but

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5787-1
00:27:13.037 --> 00:27:17.461
suddenly P6 has come now so he
will get executed and then P3 is

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5787-2
00:27:17.461 --> 00:27:20.501
executing, yeah before is about
to execute.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5803-0
00:27:20.591 --> 00:27:23.744
But then there is another
process coming with again a

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5803-1
00:27:23.744 --> 00:27:25.261
priority of say 11, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5819-0
00:27:25.271 --> 00:27:28.321
So he will get executed, but the
Speed 2.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5829-0
00:27:28.331 --> 00:27:31.411
If you see here, he has a lower
priority.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5835-0
00:27:31.461 --> 00:27:32.371
So he kept on waiting.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5839-0
00:27:33.391 --> 00:27:33.981
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5849-0
00:27:34.171 --> 00:27:38.335
And these type of jobs are
coming with higher priority,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5849-1
00:27:38.335 --> 00:27:38.781
right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5861-0
00:27:38.791 --> 00:27:41.491
So this particular case is
called as starvation.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5880-0
00:27:42.311 --> 00:27:46.729
Well, so when higher priority
jobs keep on coming, they are of

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5880-1
00:27:46.729 --> 00:27:47.851
higher priority.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5894-0
00:27:47.861 --> 00:27:49.921
So they will get the CPU, they
will execute and go.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5899-0
00:27:50.591 --> 00:27:52.061
But what about the sad guys?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5918-0
00:27:52.651 --> 00:27:56.076
They came early, but their
priority is low so they will not

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5918-1
00:27:56.076 --> 00:27:56.761
get the CPU.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5922-0
00:27:56.771 --> 00:27:57.801
They will keep starving.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5932-0
00:27:58.031 --> 00:27:59.601
They're starving for the CPU.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5943-0
00:27:59.931 --> 00:28:02.431
They don't get the CPU, they
keep waiting, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5951-0
00:28:03.551 --> 00:28:04.991
So what is 1 possible solution?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5956-0
00:28:05.001 --> 00:28:05.741
You get the point, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5966-0
00:28:05.751 --> 00:28:08.131
All of you, the very simple
line.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5992-0
00:28:09.221 --> 00:28:12.563
When higher priority jobs keep
coming, they hamper the

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5992-1
00:28:12.563 --> 00:28:16.268
execution of lower priority
jobs, so lower priority jobs are

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/5992-2
00:28:16.268 --> 00:28:18.151
set to be starving for the CPU.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6008-0
00:28:18.651 --> 00:28:22.011
What I've already existing, you
know, process has the same

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6008-1
00:28:22.011 --> 00:28:24.061
probability, then the new
priority.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6010-0
00:28:24.111 --> 00:28:24.361
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6019-0
00:28:24.371 --> 00:28:25.461
Then it just the CPU.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6063-0
00:28:25.471 --> 00:28:28.852
This short term schedule is a
very intelligent guy, so he will

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6063-1
00:28:28.852 --> 00:28:32.178
try to see who's you know, more
important based on, you know,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6063-2
00:28:32.178 --> 00:28:35.505
not just the priority but how
long have they been waiting and

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6063-3
00:28:35.505 --> 00:28:37.221
how long will they take the CPU.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6065-0
00:28:37.561 --> 00:28:37.731
Right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6071-0
00:28:37.951 --> 00:28:38.951
A very interesting course.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6073-0
00:28:38.961 --> 00:28:39.381
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6093-0
00:28:39.391 --> 00:28:43.805
So next, I mean Sunday mornings
it this course to like small

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6093-1
00:28:43.805 --> 00:28:44.601
kids types.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6105-0
00:28:44.921 --> 00:28:48.721
So yeah, so even two priorities
are two jobs.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6116-0
00:28:48.731 --> 00:28:51.081
Are there 2 processes are there
with equal priority?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6128-0
00:28:51.531 --> 00:28:54.801
Then this short term scheduler
will see other metrics right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6162-0
00:28:55.151 --> 00:28:57.825
For example, this is going to
use the CPU for five

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6162-1
00:28:57.825 --> 00:29:00.604
millisecond, but say this is
going to use for say 20

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6162-2
00:29:00.604 --> 00:29:03.907
milliseconds, then maybe it's
worthwhile to get this guy going

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6162-3
00:29:03.907 --> 00:29:04.221
right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6178-0
00:29:04.231 --> 00:29:07.278
So that he can quickly complete
and leave and then I will give

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6178-1
00:29:07.278 --> 00:29:07.761
it to him.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6191-0
00:29:07.991 --> 00:29:11.121
Or there are other metrics like
what other resources he need?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6203-0
00:29:11.231 --> 00:29:14.081
Does he have all the resources
needed and all such activities?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6205-0
00:29:14.161 --> 00:29:14.381
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6209-0
00:29:16.171 --> 00:29:16.441
Cool.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6217-0
00:29:16.451 --> 00:29:17.481
So far so good, all of you.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6227-0
00:29:17.811 --> 00:29:20.091
But the point here is, did you
understand what is starvation?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6242-0
00:29:22.411 --> 00:29:24.826
Yeah, starvation is basically
they're just waiting and

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6242-1
00:29:24.826 --> 00:29:25.221
starving.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6267-0
00:29:25.231 --> 00:29:29.587
So one possible solution is if I
increase this lower priority

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6267-1
00:29:29.587 --> 00:29:33.801
jobs priority then he will
eventually become highest right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6277-0
00:29:33.811 --> 00:29:36.041
Then he will get the CPU correct
meaning.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6291-0
00:29:36.431 --> 00:29:40.221
So if I change this seven, he
has a priority of seven, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6302-0
00:29:41.091 --> 00:29:43.181
I saw that for a long time he
has been waiting.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6336-0
00:29:43.511 --> 00:29:46.465
So what I will do is I will
change his priority to 8 again

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6336-1
00:29:46.465 --> 00:29:49.669
if new jobs are coming with high
purity, they'll keep executing

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6336-2
00:29:49.669 --> 00:29:51.221
and this guy will keep waiting.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6350-0
00:29:51.621 --> 00:29:54.361
What I will do is I'm again
feeling pity for him.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6371-0
00:29:54.421 --> 00:29:57.154
What I will do is I'll change
his priority from 8 to let's say

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6371-1
00:29:57.154 --> 00:29:57.631
suppose 15.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6382-0
00:29:58.631 --> 00:30:01.021
The moment I do 15, he will have
a higher priority.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6391-0
00:30:01.301 --> 00:30:03.831
So the next or very next few.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6396-0
00:30:03.871 --> 00:30:04.741
You know jobs.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6406-0
00:30:04.751 --> 00:30:07.351
He will go into the root and he
will get executed.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6415-0
00:30:08.721 --> 00:30:11.291
So this whole concept is called
aging.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6465-0
00:30:12.411 --> 00:30:15.672
Aging is a solution to
starvation, meaning based on the

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6465-1
00:30:15.672 --> 00:30:19.049
age of the job, you try to
increase their probability and

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6465-2
00:30:19.049 --> 00:30:22.310
when their priority is
increased, they will eventually,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6465-3
00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:25.803
you know, become the highest
priority and they will execute

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6465-4
00:30:25.803 --> 00:30:26.851
on the CPU, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6472-0
00:30:28.201 --> 00:30:29.011
So that is called.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6482-0
00:30:29.021 --> 00:30:30.901
That is nothing but increasing
the key, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6522-0
00:30:32.771 --> 00:30:35.955
So if you see here Max Heap is
used to implement a Max priority

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6522-1
00:30:35.955 --> 00:30:38.840
queue, min heap is used to
implement a min priority queue

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6522-2
00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:40.431
in Max Heap or Max parity queue.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6550-0
00:30:40.481 --> 00:30:44.167
Always delete and return an
element with maximum priority,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6550-1
00:30:44.167 --> 00:30:47.977
which is nothing but the root
which is nothing but the first

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6550-2
00:30:47.977 --> 00:30:49.351
element A of 1, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6566-0
00:30:49.361 --> 00:30:51.852
That is where the highest you
know priority element will be

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6566-1
00:30:51.852 --> 00:30:52.101
there.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6578-0
00:30:52.241 --> 00:30:54.211
Always remove this guy and give
it to the CPU.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6585-0
00:30:54.561 --> 00:30:55.721
That is the whole concept here.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6602-0
00:30:56.711 --> 00:31:00.545
Similarly in min heap it will
use the minimum as priority

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6602-1
00:31:00.545 --> 00:31:00.941
right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6620-0
00:31:00.951 --> 00:31:04.709
For example, in windows some
versions of Windows higher the

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6620-1
00:31:04.709 --> 00:31:06.901
number, higher the priority
right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6652-0
00:31:06.911 --> 00:31:10.883
So 10 means it is greater than
if I right where is in some

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6652-1
00:31:10.883 --> 00:31:15.056
operating systems 5 is higher
priority than 10/1 is very high

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6652-2
00:31:15.056 --> 00:31:15.661
priority.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6657-0
00:31:15.671 --> 00:31:17.191
Something like that, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6680-0
00:31:17.201 --> 00:31:20.079
So in that case you can use a
min heap and in other cases you

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6680-1
00:31:20.079 --> 00:31:20.961
can use a Max heap.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6683-0
00:31:22.611 --> 00:31:23.131
What is?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6691-0
00:31:23.141 --> 00:31:25.241
Uh, the used for min priority.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6694-0
00:31:25.251 --> 00:31:26.381
Yeah, same concept.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6696-0
00:31:26.391 --> 00:31:26.661
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6711-0
00:31:26.671 --> 00:31:29.121
So some operating systems, as
they told Linux and so on.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6719-0
00:31:29.591 --> 00:31:32.941
There, the smaller the number,
the higher priority, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6742-0
00:31:32.951 --> 00:31:36.663
If there are P1P2P3, if this is
having priority five, this is

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6742-1
00:31:36.663 --> 00:31:37.441
having three.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6746-0
00:31:37.451 --> 00:31:38.241
This is having one.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6752-0
00:31:38.411 --> 00:31:40.961
This is the highest priority,
right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6765-0
00:31:40.971 --> 00:31:42.831
So in those cases you can use a
min priority queue.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6768-0
00:31:45.121 --> 00:31:45.291
Cool.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6776-0
00:31:46.521 --> 00:31:47.251
So, so far so good.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6783-0
00:31:47.261 --> 00:31:49.461
All of you, this operating
system thing. Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6801-0
00:31:49.601 --> 00:31:53.291
So if you want a Max priority
queue, you will use a Max heap.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6815-0
00:31:53.361 --> 00:31:56.281
If you want a min priority
queue, you will use a min heap.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6818-0
00:31:57.061 --> 00:31:57.671
Is that clear?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6834-0
00:31:57.721 --> 00:32:02.647
Because you want the route to be
maximum priority in a Max heap,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6834-1
00:32:02.647 --> 00:32:03.101
right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6844-0
00:32:03.171 --> 00:32:04.531
And in a min heap it will be the
lowest.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6856-0
00:32:07.611 --> 00:32:10.101
So based on waiting time, we
would increase the priority.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6866-0
00:32:10.141 --> 00:32:12.181
But what if we increase the
priority of job?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6881-0
00:32:12.191 --> 00:32:14.797
What is actually a low priority
if it conflicts with the new

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6881-1
00:32:14.797 --> 00:32:15.181
priority?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6885-0
00:32:15.191 --> 00:32:15.321
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6890-0
00:32:15.331 --> 00:32:16.101
Again, the same thing.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6913-0
00:32:16.231 --> 00:32:19.065
If there are two jobs, you know
having the same priority, the OS

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6913-1
00:32:19.065 --> 00:32:21.201
will see other metrics and try
to schedule them.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6915-0
00:32:22.131 --> 00:32:22.291
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6919-0
00:32:23.901 --> 00:32:24.151
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6930-0
00:32:24.161 --> 00:32:25.971
Again, this is all OS cores
guys.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6942-0
00:32:25.981 --> 00:32:27.911
I don't want you to get too much
into all this.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6944-0
00:32:28.321 --> 00:32:28.571
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6961-0
00:32:28.581 --> 00:32:31.289
So I just wanted to give you an
application of where this is

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6961-1
00:32:31.289 --> 00:32:31.511
used.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6966-0
00:32:31.921 --> 00:32:33.241
Yeah, that's pretty much, yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6969-0
00:32:36.021 --> 00:32:36.291
Yes.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6975-0
00:32:36.301 --> 00:32:37.151
No, all of you are clear.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6981-0
00:32:37.161 --> 00:32:37.851
Yeah, I would.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6986-0
00:32:37.861 --> 00:32:38.451
I would urge you.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/6997-0
00:32:38.461 --> 00:32:41.131
There is a very, very good
textbook for operating systems.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7007-0
00:32:41.141 --> 00:32:44.754
Yeah, by operating system
fundamentals by Galvin and

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7007-1
00:32:44.754 --> 00:32:45.231
others.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7048-0
00:32:45.441 --> 00:32:47.878
So you can actually go deep into
it if you're interested in

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7048-1
00:32:47.878 --> 00:32:50.112
these, there will be no
questions on these in the exam

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7048-2
00:32:50.112 --> 00:32:52.711
and so on because these are all
pure operating system concepts.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7070-0
00:32:53.261 --> 00:32:56.189
The the reason why I had kept
this is to show you where this

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7070-1
00:32:56.189 --> 00:32:57.581
Max priority queue is useful.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7107-0
00:32:58.531 --> 00:33:01.971
So the baseline is it is useful
when you are going to have

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7107-1
00:33:01.971 --> 00:33:05.585
certain priorities associated
with your elements and you want

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7107-2
00:33:05.585 --> 00:33:08.791
to do all the operations based
on that priority eight.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7114-0
00:33:08.801 --> 00:33:10.971
One such example is the
operating system, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7121-0
00:33:11.151 --> 00:33:12.391
But there could be other cases.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7126-0
00:33:12.401 --> 00:33:14.371
Yeah, maybe.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7138-0
00:33:14.381 --> 00:33:17.351
For example, I associate a rank
with all of you, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7182-0
00:33:17.361 --> 00:33:20.652
Based on your marks for all of
you have given a rank and then I

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7182-1
00:33:20.652 --> 00:33:23.942
tell you based on your rank only
you can ask questions or based

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7182-2
00:33:23.942 --> 00:33:26.923
on your rank only you can, you
know, try to meet me in my

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7182-3
00:33:26.923 --> 00:33:27.591
office hours.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7191-0
00:33:28.971 --> 00:33:30.921
Then you will use a priority
queue, correct?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7209-0
00:33:31.151 --> 00:33:35.536
Because you if you had used the
normal queue, it is fee 4,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7209-1
00:33:35.536 --> 00:33:35.981
right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7218-0
00:33:36.271 --> 00:33:37.761
The one who gets up early in the
morning.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7224-0
00:33:37.771 --> 00:33:38.711
Who comes to the office?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7230-0
00:33:38.721 --> 00:33:39.561
They can quickly meet me.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7243-0
00:33:40.301 --> 00:33:42.071
Whereas now I have put some
ranks associated.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7268-0
00:33:42.081 --> 00:33:45.248
I'm telling that, you know, the
students who need more time or,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7268-1
00:33:45.248 --> 00:33:47.771
you know, more help from me who
have a lower rank.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7281-0
00:33:47.841 --> 00:33:49.781
They'll be the ones who have to
come first to me.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7295-0
00:33:50.601 --> 00:33:54.091
Right then I'm introducing some
priorities on how they will come

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7295-1
00:33:54.091 --> 00:33:55.111
and meet me, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7312-0
00:33:55.281 --> 00:33:58.431
So if you want to model this use
case, you will use a priority

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7312-1
00:33:58.431 --> 00:33:58.731
queue.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7314-0
00:33:59.811 --> 00:34:00.081
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7321-0
00:34:00.091 --> 00:34:01.291
Is this application now clear?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7328-0
00:34:01.301 --> 00:34:03.631
Yeah, maybe that's a good idea.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7340-0
00:34:03.641 --> 00:34:06.331
Maybe I will remove all these OS
slide from this deck.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7347-0
00:34:06.341 --> 00:34:07.161
Yeah, from the next time.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7365-0
00:34:08.191 --> 00:34:11.470
Yeah, each student is associated
with the rank and based on your

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7365-1
00:34:11.470 --> 00:34:12.781
rank only you can come in.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7374-0
00:34:13.151 --> 00:34:14.561
Meet me and clear your doubts.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7383-0
00:34:14.891 --> 00:34:17.821
Right then, that rank becomes
their priority, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7421-0
00:34:18.301 --> 00:34:21.233
And then both the ways I can put
the rule, I can tell that you

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7421-1
00:34:21.233 --> 00:34:23.793
know people who have a lower
rank, they can come first

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7421-2
00:34:23.793 --> 00:34:25.421
because they need more time to
be.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7440-0
00:34:25.611 --> 00:34:29.024
I can use that or I can tell
that the top rankers can come

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7440-1
00:34:29.024 --> 00:34:29.371
first.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7456-0
00:34:30.231 --> 00:34:33.486
So if you want the top rankers,
you will use a Max priority

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7456-1
00:34:33.486 --> 00:34:34.191
queue, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7460-0
00:34:34.251 --> 00:34:34.761
Right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7485-0
00:34:34.911 --> 00:34:37.875
Maximum rank people will come
first or you can use a min

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7485-1
00:34:37.875 --> 00:34:41.099
priority queue where the minimum
rankers will come in with me

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7485-2
00:34:41.099 --> 00:34:41.411
first.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7487-0
00:34:43.131 --> 00:34:43.321
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7496-0
00:34:43.331 --> 00:34:44.421
Is this clear for all of you?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7499-0
00:34:44.491 --> 00:34:45.001
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7526-0
00:34:45.071 --> 00:34:48.597
What is Max parity mean priority
and you can have a couple of,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7526-1
00:34:48.597 --> 00:34:52.011
you know, uh operations on it
like you can do insert, right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7536-0
00:34:52.021 --> 00:34:53.891
Obviously you can insert a new
element X.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7552-0
00:34:54.821 --> 00:34:58.337
Yeah, maximum returns the
element with largest key and

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7552-1
00:34:58.337 --> 00:34:59.551
where will that be?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7567-0
00:34:59.561 --> 00:35:03.861
If it is a Max priority queue,
it'll be at the root right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7582-0
00:35:04.591 --> 00:35:07.585
Maximum will only return it to
you, it will not remove it,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7582-1
00:35:07.585 --> 00:35:07.991
correct?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7590-0
00:35:08.001 --> 00:35:09.941
It will just tell you what it
is, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7598-0
00:35:11.521 --> 00:35:12.491
Yeah, there is no difference.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7615-0
00:35:12.501 --> 00:35:15.164
Jagdish, it is actually the
same, only it is just the way we

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7615-1
00:35:15.164 --> 00:35:15.731
implement it.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7625-0
00:35:16.181 --> 00:35:18.611
Yeah, but both are actually the
same concept.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7641-0
00:35:18.661 --> 00:35:21.981
Yeah, that is why I'm just
talking about maxi mean heap.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7667-0
00:35:21.991 --> 00:35:25.435
You can just, you know, take the
opposite of it, where you will

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7667-1
00:35:25.435 --> 00:35:28.771
take the lower value, but it's
exactly the same extract, Max.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7680-0
00:35:28.981 --> 00:35:32.151
It not just tells you who's the
maximum, but it also removes it.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7692-0
00:35:32.461 --> 00:35:34.831
It will remove it again the root
only right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7705-0
00:35:35.401 --> 00:35:36.761
It will remove it and give it to
the CPU.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7720-0
00:35:38.121 --> 00:35:42.751
Increase key increase access key
to a new value K right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7732-0
00:35:43.141 --> 00:35:45.421
For example, this is adding a
current priority of five.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7758-0
00:35:45.801 --> 00:35:49.283
I want to increase it to say 10
so this will be the new K value,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7758-1
00:35:49.283 --> 00:35:51.371
assuming K is at least as large
as ex.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7761-0
00:35:51.381 --> 00:35:53.141
Is old, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7779-0
00:35:53.731 --> 00:35:58.031
Yeah, I mean, uh, this is at the
end a set of elements, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7789-0
00:35:58.321 --> 00:35:59.831
So a set or sequence of
elements.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7817-0
00:35:59.841 --> 00:36:03.286
That is why we are using a set
and in a lot of times as you

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7817-1
00:36:03.286 --> 00:36:06.271
told, we might not want to allow
duplicates, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7831-0
00:36:06.281 --> 00:36:10.061
We don't want multiple elements
with the same key, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7854-0
00:36:10.071 --> 00:36:13.045
If 10 elements are there, if all
of them have the same priority,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7854-1
00:36:13.045 --> 00:36:15.331
then there is no point in having
priority, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7868-0
00:36:16.171 --> 00:36:19.376
Your similar example I want to
have all of you given different

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7868-1
00:36:19.376 --> 00:36:19.681
ranks.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7884-0
00:36:20.271 --> 00:36:23.281
I don't want hundred people to
have, you know, rank one right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7906-0
00:36:23.291 --> 00:36:27.196
I don't want to do that, so if
you give this word set set means

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7906-1
00:36:27.196 --> 00:36:29.331
you cannot have duplicates,
right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7919-0
00:36:30.591 --> 00:36:32.911
But yeah, again, you're doing a
master's course. Guys.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7922-0
00:36:32.921 --> 00:36:33.141
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7939-0
00:36:33.151 --> 00:36:35.641
So don't go by the slide or the
textbook, and so on.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7955-0
00:36:36.051 --> 00:36:38.559
You can actually implement and
Max priority queue using a

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7955-1
00:36:38.559 --> 00:36:39.121
normal array.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7967-0
00:36:39.131 --> 00:36:41.941
Also in that case you will be
able to allow duplicates.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7972-0
00:36:41.951 --> 00:36:44.851
Also, you get it right Vinay.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7993-0
00:36:48.241 --> 00:36:51.535
Yeah, that's that word is used
here because this is a

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/7993-1
00:36:51.535 --> 00:36:52.571
mathematical set.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8031-0
00:36:52.701 --> 00:36:57.306
If you use a mathematical set,
you cannot have duplicates here,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8031-1
00:36:57.306 --> 00:37:01.766
so we are then telling that in
my Max priority queue I am not

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8031-2
00:37:01.766 --> 00:37:05.291
going to allow jobs with same
priority, correct?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8040-0
00:37:05.301 --> 00:37:07.511
This is what this definition
means, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8061-0
00:37:08.641 --> 00:37:11.931
But if I don't want to use this
word set, if I'm telling insert

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8061-1
00:37:11.931 --> 00:37:12.701
element X into.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8092-0
00:37:14.201 --> 00:37:17.819
Reddy this definition simply
means that I'm going to

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8092-1
00:37:17.819 --> 00:37:21.777
implement this Max priority
queue as a heap only, and I'm

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8092-2
00:37:21.777 --> 00:37:23.551
going to allow duplicates.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8102-0
00:37:23.911 --> 00:37:26.221
I can have 2-3 jobs with the
same priority.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8105-0
00:37:27.911 --> 00:37:28.171
Yes.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8109-0
00:37:28.181 --> 00:37:28.961
No, all of you.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8111-0
00:37:29.091 --> 00:37:29.491
Is it clear?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8125-0
00:37:32.881 --> 00:37:35.281
So it is all based on the
definition and our needs.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8128-0
00:37:35.291 --> 00:37:35.571
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8135-0
00:37:35.581 --> 00:37:37.261
So don't go by the textbooks.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8160-0
00:37:37.271 --> 00:37:41.570
Yeah, a lot of times, even
eminent professors make those

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8160-1
00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:46.019
mistakes that the textbook is
just an authors perspective,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8160-2
00:37:46.019 --> 00:37:46.471
right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8197-0
00:37:46.681 --> 00:37:49.896
So if your application doesn't
require multiple jobs to you

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8197-1
00:37:49.896 --> 00:37:53.270
know have a same priority, then
of course you can implement it

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8197-2
00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:56.270
in that way and that is the
whole beauty of programming

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8197-3
00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:56.591
right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8210-0
00:37:56.991 --> 00:37:59.370
Instead of a set or something,
you will implement it as an

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8210-1
00:37:59.370 --> 00:37:59.611
array.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8233-0
00:38:00.261 --> 00:38:03.161
You will implement it using the
heap only, which is the Max heap

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8233-1
00:38:03.161 --> 00:38:04.811
and you will not put any
constraint.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8242-0
00:38:04.821 --> 00:38:07.801
You can actually allow multiple
jobs to have the same priority.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8246-0
00:38:10.931 --> 00:38:11.141
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8250-0
00:38:11.151 --> 00:38:11.831
Is this clear? Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8270-0
00:38:13.901 --> 00:38:17.550
So Min priority queue will offer
insert minimum, extract minimum

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8270-1
00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:18.841
and decrease key right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8275-0
00:38:18.851 --> 00:38:20.881
The exact opposites of these
methods.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8285-0
00:38:23.271 --> 00:38:24.481
Keeps our very convenient here.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8298-0
00:38:24.531 --> 00:38:27.241
Using Max Heap, we know that the
largest element is in a of 1.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8315-0
00:38:27.251 --> 00:38:30.081
So just remove it and give it to
the CPU or you know any of that.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8326-0
00:38:30.211 --> 00:38:31.591
So it's a constant complexity.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8348-0
00:38:32.631 --> 00:38:36.231
Removing or inserting elements
and increasing keys means that

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8348-1
00:38:36.231 --> 00:38:39.831
we are basically calling Max CP5
at the right place, correct?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8363-0
00:38:39.901 --> 00:38:42.780
Because anytime you insert
something, it might violate that

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8363-1
00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:43.211
property.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8382-0
00:38:43.321 --> 00:38:46.941
So you will have to perform Max
CP5 so that it goes to its

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8382-1
00:38:46.941 --> 00:38:48.351
proper position, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8384-0
00:38:49.651 --> 00:38:49.871
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8390-0
00:38:49.881 --> 00:38:50.341
Is this clear?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8412-0
00:38:50.351 --> 00:38:54.438
Guys, all of you said, how about
percentile CPU usage percent,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8412-1
00:38:54.438 --> 00:38:57.551
how they are taken in priority
to kill the Max?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8416-0
00:38:57.661 --> 00:38:58.481
Yeah. That depends.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8423-0
00:38:58.491 --> 00:38:59.151
Yeah, it it.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8436-0
00:38:59.341 --> 00:39:02.631
It's larger than just to handle
in a one line answer.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8454-0
00:39:02.961 --> 00:39:05.958
So you're operating system uses
several techniques for CPU

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8454-1
00:39:05.958 --> 00:39:08.091
management scheduling and you
know so on.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8461-0
00:39:08.581 --> 00:39:10.671
So priority is one of the
factors.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8483-0
00:39:10.821 --> 00:39:14.520
Yeah, but of course you can use
the priority queues to handle

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8483-1
00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:15.951
these type of use cases.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8498-0
00:39:17.871 --> 00:39:21.481
So if I want to get the maximum,
what is the complexity?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8512-0
00:39:21.811 --> 00:39:24.736
Keep maximum will be nothing but
a of 1, which is constant

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8512-1
00:39:24.736 --> 00:39:25.281
complexity.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8526-0
00:39:26.151 --> 00:39:30.771
If I want to extract the maximum
from the heap, what operation is

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8526-1
00:39:30.771 --> 00:39:31.121
this?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8541-0
00:39:31.131 --> 00:39:34.485
Can someone clearly tell me that
I've already given the answer

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8541-1
00:39:34.485 --> 00:39:34.751
here?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8549-0
00:39:35.911 --> 00:39:38.781
We want to extract maximum from
a priority queue.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8576-0
00:39:39.131 --> 00:39:43.260
It is nothing but a Max heap and
in a Max heap the largest will

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8576-1
00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:46.291
be in the root and that route
will be deleted.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8591-0
00:39:46.301 --> 00:39:49.481
So this is nothing but a
deletion use case deletion from

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8591-1
00:39:49.481 --> 00:39:49.871
a heap.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8599-0
00:39:51.031 --> 00:39:52.781
Yeah, and deletion from a root.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8608-0
00:39:52.791 --> 00:39:56.421
What is the complexity login
right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8635-0
00:39:56.491 --> 00:39:59.966
Because you delete the route and
then you put that last leaf

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8635-1
00:39:59.966 --> 00:40:03.611
there and then it will perform,
which bubbling will it perform?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8643-0
00:40:03.661 --> 00:40:06.351
It is going from top to bottom
right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8649-0
00:40:08.421 --> 00:40:08.681
Yes.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8657-0
00:40:08.691 --> 00:40:11.271
No down he bubbling will happen.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8668-0
00:40:11.981 --> 00:40:14.001
So all that is happening, that
is, what is this code?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8673-0
00:40:14.061 --> 00:40:14.931
Yeah, I will.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8706-0
00:40:14.941 --> 00:40:18.545
I will urge you to look at these
code later, but don't go too

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8706-1
00:40:18.545 --> 00:40:22.264
deep into it, but this part is
technically nothing but deleting

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8706-2
00:40:22.264 --> 00:40:22.961
from a heap.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8727-0
00:40:23.581 --> 00:40:26.299
I've also, you know, I'll be
uploading that Python notebook,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8727-1
00:40:26.299 --> 00:40:28.571
so it'll be even more clear than
these code, yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8738-0
00:40:31.151 --> 00:40:34.121
That increase heap example for
you. Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8748-0
00:40:34.191 --> 00:40:37.221
So there is currently this is
the Max heap.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8761-0
00:40:37.271 --> 00:40:39.321
Can I also call this as a Max
priority queue?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8764-0
00:40:39.331 --> 00:40:41.641
Now yes, no.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8774-0
00:40:41.651 --> 00:40:44.391
If I just convert this into an
array, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8805-0
00:40:45.651 --> 00:40:49.495
This can be called as a Max
priority queue and based on the

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8805-1
00:40:49.495 --> 00:40:53.339
priorities the CPU or you know
that scheduler will pick him

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8805-2
00:40:53.339 --> 00:40:53.851
correct.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8814-0
00:40:53.911 --> 00:40:56.141
So in this case, who is the job?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8822-0
00:40:56.151 --> 00:40:57.691
Who is going to get executed
next?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8832-0
00:40:59.091 --> 00:41:01.321
So all these numbers are
priorities of jobs.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8846-0
00:41:01.471 --> 00:41:04.007
Yeah, there are many jobs here
and each of them is the

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8846-1
00:41:04.007 --> 00:41:04.421
priority.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8853-0
00:41:04.871 --> 00:41:06.401
So which job will execute next?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8857-0
00:41:06.411 --> 00:41:06.921
Very good.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8869-0
00:41:07.211 --> 00:41:10.448
The job with priority Sixteen
will execute, meaning I will

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8869-1
00:41:10.448 --> 00:41:11.051
delete him.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8921-0
00:41:11.331 --> 00:41:15.385
I will give him to the CPU and
then this one will go there and

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8921-1
00:41:15.385 --> 00:41:18.795
then I will perform the
complete, you know, don't be

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8921-2
00:41:18.795 --> 00:41:22.785
bubbling and then who will be
the job next if you do all that

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8921-3
00:41:22.785 --> 00:41:26.517
systematically, then 14 would
have become the next route,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8921-4
00:41:26.517 --> 00:41:27.031
correct.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8933-0
00:41:27.041 --> 00:41:28.731
He will go to the CPU next and
so on.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8940-0
00:41:28.741 --> 00:41:30.701
It will keep happening now.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8949-0
00:41:30.711 --> 00:41:33.151
There is this guy who has a
priority of four.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8964-0
00:41:34.711 --> 00:41:38.655
Sadly, new jobs keep on coming
and they are having high

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8964-1
00:41:38.655 --> 00:41:39.781
priority, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8976-0
00:41:39.921 --> 00:41:42.321
So he will not get executed for
a long time, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8995-0
00:41:42.451 --> 00:41:46.144
So what I want to do is I want
to change this priority from 4

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/8995-1
00:41:46.144 --> 00:41:46.501
to 15.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9006-0
00:41:46.951 --> 00:41:47.641
So what I've done?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9016-0
00:41:47.651 --> 00:41:49.391
I've just changed this 4 to 15.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9042-0
00:41:50.411 --> 00:41:55.139
The moment I do this after this,
this is as good as insertion of

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9042-1
00:41:55.139 --> 00:41:58.411
a new element with priority 15
only correct.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9076-0
00:41:58.551 --> 00:42:02.148
I will again perform the same,
you know, bubbling SO15 will get

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9076-1
00:42:02.148 --> 00:42:05.520
swapped, 15 will get swapped and
so on and he'll go to this

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9076-2
00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:06.981
proper position like this.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9104-0
00:42:07.281 --> 00:42:11.176
And now the next time after this
job executes, 15 will be the

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9104-1
00:42:11.176 --> 00:42:14.631
next job, so he will get the CP,
just know all of you.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9116-0
00:42:15.821 --> 00:42:17.781
Yet these summer and Amit, all
of you really get this.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9152-0
00:42:18.761 --> 00:42:22.180
The only thing is after you
change this value to a new

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9152-1
00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:25.846
value, it becomes as good as
adding a new element and then

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9152-2
00:42:25.846 --> 00:42:28.891
you will again perform the same
you know public.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9162-0
00:42:30.141 --> 00:42:32.451
What will happen to job for job
four is still there?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9164-0
00:42:32.461 --> 00:42:32.581
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9175-0
00:42:33.561 --> 00:42:36.851
So you guys got slightly
confused.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9185-0
00:42:36.861 --> 00:42:38.481
So for example, I'll have to
write it like this.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9191-0
00:42:39.981 --> 00:42:41.071
There is this job.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9219-0
00:42:41.081 --> 00:42:45.655
Who as a priority for the job is
still here, but his priority got

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9219-1
00:42:45.655 --> 00:42:48.911
updated from 4 to 50, so that
was still there.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9223-0
00:42:48.981 --> 00:42:49.411
Exactly.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9227-0
00:42:49.421 --> 00:42:50.061
This is upbeat.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9230-0
00:42:50.071 --> 00:42:50.931
Public perfect.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9237-0
00:42:51.021 --> 00:42:51.931
Yeah, your bank on.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9249-0
00:42:52.061 --> 00:42:54.141
So this 15 will bubble up and
he'll go and execute.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9260-0
00:42:55.621 --> 00:42:59.961
So this updation is not very
different from insertion right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9283-0
00:43:01.481 --> 00:43:04.144
So if you want to increase key
then of course the new key

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9283-1
00:43:04.144 --> 00:43:06.301
should not be smaller than
current key, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9300-0
00:43:06.501 --> 00:43:09.232
If this element is 4, I should
not be updating with three or

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9300-1
00:43:09.232 --> 00:43:09.411
one.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9303-0
00:43:09.421 --> 00:43:10.891
Then I'm doing bad.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9318-0
00:43:10.901 --> 00:43:13.531
I'm actually not helping that
job, so I should not do that.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9347-0
00:43:13.881 --> 00:43:16.451
Otherwise, what I can do is I
will just, you know, try to

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9347-1
00:43:16.451 --> 00:43:19.020
increase his key, which is
nothing but insertion into the

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9347-2
00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:19.241
heap.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9364-0
00:43:20.181 --> 00:43:22.713
And when I want to insert
something then I can use this

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9364-1
00:43:22.713 --> 00:43:23.391
same code also.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9385-0
00:43:23.481 --> 00:43:26.029
That's a very clever way of
doing, but if you don't want,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9385-1
00:43:26.029 --> 00:43:27.741
just write this same lines again
here.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9388-0
00:43:29.141 --> 00:43:29.431
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9395-0
00:43:29.441 --> 00:43:31.491
And again the same complexity
log in.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9402-0
00:43:33.661 --> 00:43:34.131
Uh, yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9421-0
00:43:34.141 --> 00:43:36.557
The only rule in increase in the
keys, it should be greater than

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9421-1
00:43:36.557 --> 00:43:37.151
the current key.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9434-0
00:43:37.561 --> 00:43:41.120
If it is 4, then the new key
should be anything greater than

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9434-1
00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:41.411
four.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9437-0
00:43:41.561 --> 00:43:41.901
That's it.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9464-0
00:43:42.701 --> 00:43:46.792
Yeah, for one, it is down he
bubbling and for 15 it is

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9464-1
00:43:46.792 --> 00:43:49.841
upheld, bubbling or no for both
of them.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9490-0
00:43:50.101 --> 00:43:54.227
Anything that goes from bottom
to up is upheld, bubbling right

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9490-1
00:43:54.227 --> 00:43:57.631
and anything that comes from top
to bottom is down.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9492-0
00:43:57.641 --> 00:43:58.091
Heap bubbling.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9504-0
00:43:59.251 --> 00:44:03.151
Simple in this case 15 is or 15
or one.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9513-0
00:44:03.161 --> 00:44:05.511
Whoever it is, they are going to
go up.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9535-0
00:44:05.521 --> 00:44:09.101
So it is up heat bubbling,
whereas when I delete 16, what

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9535-1
00:44:09.101 --> 00:44:09.841
will happen?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9567-0
00:44:09.851 --> 00:44:13.140
The last element will go there,
so one would have come here and

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9567-1
00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:16.378
then he will again bubble down
to his correct position that is

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9567-2
00:44:16.378 --> 00:44:17.611
called down he bubbling.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9575-0
00:44:18.121 --> 00:44:20.831
And again, I repeat, please
watch the recordings.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9589-0
00:44:20.901 --> 00:44:24.390
Yeah, every class from now on is
very related to previous

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9589-1
00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:24.871
classes.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9601-0
00:44:25.121 --> 00:44:27.321
All this we have learned in
detail in the last class.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9624-0
00:44:28.321 --> 00:44:35.580
Yeah, Class 3 array is 16151014
and so on and 10 is less than

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9624-1
00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:35.931
14.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9628-0
00:44:36.541 --> 00:44:37.431
Yeah, that's fine.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9639-0
00:44:37.481 --> 00:44:39.471
Yeah, that can always be there,
no problem.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9652-0
00:44:39.761 --> 00:44:43.552
But after 16 executes, this tree
would have got rearranged,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9652-1
00:44:43.552 --> 00:44:43.931
right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9671-0
00:44:43.941 --> 00:44:47.589
And 15 would have gone to the
top right and after that there

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9671-1
00:44:47.589 --> 00:44:49.741
will again be a rearranging,
right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9677-0
00:44:49.751 --> 00:44:50.881
So that way it will get
corrected.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9680-0
00:44:53.931 --> 00:44:54.091
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9689-0
00:44:55.451 --> 00:44:56.931
Why is it not a complete binary
tree?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9701-0
00:45:00.851 --> 00:45:03.041
Yeah, these are all complete
binary trees, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9705-0
00:45:03.271 --> 00:45:04.071
Anyone disagrees?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9712-0
00:45:07.351 --> 00:45:09.051
Yeah, real quick.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9724-0
00:45:09.061 --> 00:45:10.981
Can you confirm if this is a
complete binary or not?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9737-0
00:45:12.011 --> 00:45:14.201
Definitely yes, it is fully
filled in these levels.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9744-0
00:45:14.211 --> 00:45:15.811
The last level is from left to
right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9752-0
00:45:16.251 --> 00:45:17.991
This is definitely a complete
binary tree, yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9757-0
00:45:20.931 --> 00:45:21.261
Pull.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9765-0
00:45:21.331 --> 00:45:23.941
That being said, that completes
the priority queues.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9775-0
00:45:23.991 --> 00:45:27.571
Yeah, and some other
applications.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9782-0
00:45:27.581 --> 00:45:28.891
Heaps are used in heap sort.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9790-0
00:45:28.941 --> 00:45:30.451
It is used in priority queues.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9800-0
00:45:30.701 --> 00:45:32.531
It is used in order statistics.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9825-0
00:45:32.581 --> 00:45:36.022
Yeah, the heap data structure
can be used efficiently to find

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9825-1
00:45:36.022 --> 00:45:39.351
the KTH the smallest or largest
element in an array, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9841-0
00:45:39.361 --> 00:45:42.006
Which we have seen several
times, even in the last class I

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9841-1
00:45:42.006 --> 00:45:42.991
spoke about it, right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9848-0
00:45:46.861 --> 00:45:47.781
You remember this example?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9856-0
00:45:48.841 --> 00:45:49.721
This is a Max heap.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9873-0
00:45:50.381 --> 00:45:52.902
You don't even know the numbers,
but I'm claiming that this is a

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9873-1
00:45:52.902 --> 00:45:53.251
Max heap.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9879-0
00:45:54.211 --> 00:45:56.081
Where is the second largest
element?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9901-0
00:45:57.901 --> 00:46:01.259
Yeah, in a normal array, you
don't know where is the largest,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9901-1
00:46:01.259 --> 00:46:03.371
where is the second largest,
etcetera.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9921-0
00:46:03.461 --> 00:46:06.526
So you'll have two completely
traverse the array which is big

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9921-1
00:46:06.526 --> 00:46:06.921
off yen.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9928-0
00:46:07.951 --> 00:46:09.301
Where is in a Max heap.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9935-0
00:46:09.451 --> 00:46:10.541
You very well know.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9946-0
00:46:10.551 --> 00:46:12.191
The largest is here in the root.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9958-0
00:46:13.111 --> 00:46:18.413
The second largest is somewhere
here or here, so this is level

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9958-1
00:46:18.413 --> 00:46:18.581
0.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9964-0
00:46:18.591 --> 00:46:19.341
This is level one.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9973-0
00:46:20.821 --> 00:46:22.931
Yeah, all of you who told level
2 wrong.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9988-0
00:46:23.161 --> 00:46:25.401
Yeah, that is way again and
again.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/9998-0
00:46:25.411 --> 00:46:29.011
I repeat, it's all about the
small nuances right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10009-0
00:46:29.021 --> 00:46:31.751
We learned about terminologies
in one of our classes, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10022-0
00:46:32.121 --> 00:46:35.261
The root is always in level 0
then this is level one.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10035-0
00:46:36.251 --> 00:46:38.541
I know all of you got it right
in your mental model.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10059-0
00:46:38.551 --> 00:46:41.834
You told it as level 2, but in
quizzes and exams you will write

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10059-1
00:46:41.834 --> 00:46:43.321
away lose marks there, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10064-0
00:46:43.371 --> 00:46:44.041
So don't do that.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10072-0
00:46:44.431 --> 00:46:45.591
So this is level one.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10096-0
00:46:45.601 --> 00:46:50.354
This is level 2, so your second
largest element will be in Level

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10096-1
00:46:50.354 --> 00:46:53.571
1, which is nothing but these
two elements.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10128-0
00:46:53.581 --> 00:46:56.528
I'll have to just check these
two elements for the second

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10128-1
00:46:56.528 --> 00:46:59.829
largest, which is going to be a
constant complexity for me, just

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10128-2
00:46:59.829 --> 00:47:01.251
the if else condition right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10186-0
00:47:02.861 --> 00:47:06.038
So in order statistics, heaps
are again helpful and heap

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10186-1
00:47:06.038 --> 00:47:09.270
implemented priority queue,
meaning Max priority queue or

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10186-2
00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:12.836
min priority queue are used in
many graph algorithms like PRIMS

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10186-3
00:47:12.836 --> 00:47:15.845
algorithm which extracts
algorithm and so on which we

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10186-4
00:47:15.845 --> 00:47:18.631
will learn in the later part of
this course yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10190-0
00:47:21.071 --> 00:47:21.321
Yes.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10193-0
00:47:21.331 --> 00:47:21.481
No.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10198-0
00:47:21.491 --> 00:47:22.061
So far so good.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10208-0
00:47:22.071 --> 00:47:24.651
All of you and there are many
more exercises for you.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10226-0
00:47:24.661 --> 00:47:28.655
Again, yeah, try to do all of
these exercises and now we will

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10226-1
00:47:28.655 --> 00:47:29.621
go with graphs.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10228-0
00:47:30.391 --> 00:47:30.621
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10237-0
00:47:30.631 --> 00:47:32.031
Is this clear for all of you?
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10240-0
00:47:34.801 --> 00:47:35.071
Yes.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10245-0
00:47:35.081 --> 00:47:36.261
No, maybe the applications.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10249-0
00:47:40.731 --> 00:47:40.891
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10256-0
00:47:41.841 --> 00:47:42.691
What is a heap?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10262-0
00:47:43.081 --> 00:47:44.651
He pacification heapsort.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10266-0
00:47:44.661 --> 00:47:45.311
Priority queue.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10268-0
00:47:45.321 --> 00:47:46.131
All these concepts?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10304-0
00:47:46.141 --> 00:47:49.638
Yeah, so please try to know
again, go back the ways them

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10304-1
00:47:49.638 --> 00:47:53.197
solve these exercises and you
know, start some discussion

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10304-2
00:47:53.197 --> 00:47:56.141
threads and that will be really
fruitful. Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10314-0
00:47:59.541 --> 00:48:00.731
So let's go ahead with graphs.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10316-0
00:48:00.741 --> 00:48:01.191
All of you?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10332-0
00:48:01.261 --> 00:48:04.971
Yeah, real quick, maybe you can
react or gotten the chat.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10338-0
00:48:05.371 --> 00:48:06.731
This is a new data structure,
yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10347-0
00:48:09.641 --> 00:48:10.671
Any of the leaf or fruit?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10352-0
00:48:10.681 --> 00:48:11.411
Yeah, that's correct.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10354-0
00:48:11.421 --> 00:48:11.481
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10357-0
00:48:13.431 --> 00:48:13.601
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10360-0
00:48:13.611 --> 00:48:14.401
What about others?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10375-0
00:48:14.551 --> 00:48:17.441
I just see, you know, saurab
another one or two folks.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10395-0
00:48:19.621 --> 00:48:22.599
Yeah, if you have not understood
something in the prior trees, go

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10395-1
00:48:22.599 --> 00:48:23.591
back to the recording.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10402-0
00:48:23.601 --> 00:48:25.091
But now let's come back to
graph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10410-0
00:48:25.101 --> 00:48:26.431
This is a new topic. Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10420-0
00:48:26.481 --> 00:48:31.061
So we'll focus on this one.
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10428-0
00:48:32.761 --> 00:48:33.841
So what really is this graph?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10447-0
00:48:35.041 --> 00:48:39.216
A graph G is defined as a pair
of two sets V&amp;E the moment

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10447-1
00:48:39.216 --> 00:48:40.091
there is set.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10451-0
00:48:40.101 --> 00:48:40.971
What can you infer?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10457-0
00:48:41.041 --> 00:48:43.481
Can there be duplicates? Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10466-0
00:48:45.851 --> 00:48:47.041
Yeah, there is no deliverable.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10475-0
00:48:47.051 --> 00:48:48.741
These are all self try excesses.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10483-0
00:48:48.791 --> 00:48:49.991
I'm not going to police you.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10502-0
00:48:50.771 --> 00:48:53.111
It's up to you if you solve it
or not, and there is no

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10502-1
00:48:53.111 --> 00:48:53.621
deliverable.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10504-0
00:48:53.631 --> 00:48:54.101
Absolutely.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10514-0
00:48:54.111 --> 00:48:56.381
Yeah, it's only for you to, you
know, solve it.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10539-0
00:48:58.361 --> 00:49:02.350
Where we the set of nodes called
as vertices and east is a

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10539-1
00:49:02.350 --> 00:49:05.391
collection of pair of vertices
called edges.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10543-0
00:49:05.881 --> 00:49:08.641
Meaning all these circles?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10552-0
00:49:08.841 --> 00:49:10.371
Yeah, 123.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10567-0
00:49:10.641 --> 00:49:15.221
All these circles are called as
nodes or I can call it as

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10567-1
00:49:15.221 --> 00:49:15.931
vertices.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10581-0
00:49:16.081 --> 00:49:20.061
Both are the same thing and all
these lines are called as edges.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10585-0
00:49:21.211 --> 00:49:21.781
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10618-0
00:49:21.871 --> 00:49:25.891
So G is equal to we comma E in
this example we is nothing but

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10618-1
00:49:25.891 --> 00:49:29.781
this circles 123456 and the
number of nodes are six, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10648-0
00:49:29.791 --> 00:49:33.996
Because there are six here, it
just is again a set, but it is a

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10648-1
00:49:33.996 --> 00:49:37.411
pair of vertices, meaning I can
go from one to six.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10653-0
00:49:37.461 --> 00:49:38.251
There's an arrow here.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10682-0
00:49:38.261 --> 00:49:41.458
We'll come to this arrow in a
minute, but just one to six is

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10682-1
00:49:41.458 --> 00:49:44.811
there, then one to two is there
and then two to three is there.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10704-0
00:49:44.871 --> 00:49:48.902
So all the lines we are
documenting the in a set and

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10704-1
00:49:48.902 --> 00:49:50.651
that is called as edge.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10722-0
00:49:52.021 --> 00:49:55.223
These are the set of edges and
this whole thing is now called

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10722-1
00:49:55.223 --> 00:49:55.791
as a graph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10725-0
00:49:57.191 --> 00:49:57.561
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10738-0
00:49:57.611 --> 00:50:00.851
Is this clear guys for all of
you, it's not.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10761-0
00:50:02.791 --> 00:50:05.811
Though if you want to also know
a lot of background about this,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10761-1
00:50:05.811 --> 00:50:07.981
you can, you know, Google about
conics. Bugs.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10763-0
00:50:07.991 --> 00:50:08.481
Bridge.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10765-0
00:50:08.971 --> 00:50:09.301
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10809-0
00:50:09.311 --> 00:50:12.962
So there was a very interesting
problem in Europe and you know,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10809-1
00:50:12.962 --> 00:50:16.613
there was a scientist, you know,
Euler and so on, who had tried

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10809-2
00:50:16.613 --> 00:50:20.206
to solve this and that is when
this whole concept of graph was

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10809-3
00:50:20.206 --> 00:50:20.491
born.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10829-0
00:50:21.511 --> 00:50:24.795
And it is a very, very, very
important part of theoretical

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10829-1
00:50:24.795 --> 00:50:25.741
computer science.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10860-0
00:50:26.331 --> 00:50:30.587
Your whole data science, your
advanced AI, ML, they all rely

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10860-1
00:50:30.587 --> 00:50:34.493
on fundamental data structures
like graph and this is a

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10860-2
00:50:34.493 --> 00:50:37.911
complete subject on its own
called graph theory.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10871-0
00:50:38.061 --> 00:50:41.111
Yeah, so this can be taught for
years together.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10881-0
00:50:41.221 --> 00:50:43.251
Yeah, this is a very, very
interesting concept.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10901-0
00:50:43.581 --> 00:50:46.772
There are thousands of
algorithms and things related to

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10901-1
00:50:46.772 --> 00:50:49.621
this field and there is active
research even now.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10909-0
00:50:50.971 --> 00:50:52.041
But it all started here.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10916-0
00:50:52.051 --> 00:50:53.611
There were a set of islands.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10930-0
00:50:53.621 --> 00:50:55.781
There was A bridge and you know
things like that.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10949-0
00:50:55.791 --> 00:50:59.383
And then this particular
scientist converted that real

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10949-1
00:50:59.383 --> 00:51:01.081
life problem into a graph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10955-0
00:51:01.171 --> 00:51:04.546
And that's when this whole
concept of graph was born,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10955-1
00:51:04.546 --> 00:51:04.921
right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10962-0
00:51:05.071 --> 00:51:06.151
It's a set of vertices.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10968-0
00:51:06.161 --> 00:51:07.961
It's a set of edges, yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10975-0
00:51:10.501 --> 00:51:11.451
Let's take an example.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10979-0
00:51:11.801 --> 00:51:11.961
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/10988-0
00:51:12.821 --> 00:51:14.281
So this one is a graph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11000-0
00:51:15.391 --> 00:51:19.231
A vertex represents an airport
or a vertex or a node.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11004-0
00:51:19.241 --> 00:51:19.931
Both are the same.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11026-0
00:51:20.481 --> 00:51:23.866
Represent the rapport and store
the three letter airport code

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11026-1
00:51:23.866 --> 00:51:25.121
and enjoy the presence.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11047-0
00:51:25.131 --> 00:51:29.298
A flight route between 2
airports and stores the mileage

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11047-1
00:51:29.298 --> 00:51:32.441
of this route right, for example
from Ord.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11083-0
00:51:32.451 --> 00:51:37.868
This is an airport and PVD is an
airport to go from PVD to OD to

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11083-1
00:51:37.868 --> 00:51:39.701
PVD or from PVD to Rd.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11087-0
00:51:39.751 --> 00:51:43.081
It takes 849 kilometers, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11103-0
00:51:43.091 --> 00:51:46.472
Similarly for any other nodes,
so this is an example of a

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11103-1
00:51:46.472 --> 00:51:46.821
graph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11110-0
00:51:47.681 --> 00:51:48.721
Is this clear for all of you?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11120-0
00:51:50.961 --> 00:51:52.691
Yeah, you can model the same.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11146-0
00:51:52.701 --> 00:51:56.011
You know the whole, uh, Indian
domestic airports and you know,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11146-1
00:51:56.011 --> 00:51:59.321
kilometers and all that using a
graph will be able to do that.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11153-0
00:52:00.421 --> 00:52:02.041
Yes, simple stuff, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11160-0
00:52:02.051 --> 00:52:03.271
This is a small example.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11173-0
00:52:05.501 --> 00:52:07.501
Can you think of other examples
of graph modeling?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11178-0
00:52:08.471 --> 00:52:09.241
It's right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11184-0
00:52:09.711 --> 00:52:12.481
Google Maps, Facebook and
friends, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11205-0
00:52:12.751 --> 00:52:17.826
Can I consider each profile to
be a node and the friendships to

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11205-1
00:52:17.826 --> 00:52:18.381
be age?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11232-0
00:52:18.851 --> 00:52:22.066
Let's say suppose this person is
a friend with this person is a

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11232-1
00:52:22.066 --> 00:52:25.380
friend with this person, whereas
he's not a friend with this guy,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11232-2
00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:25.681
right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11238-0
00:52:27.231 --> 00:52:28.061
Yeah, it's all the same.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11241-0
00:52:28.071 --> 00:52:28.341
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11243-0
00:52:28.351 --> 00:52:28.691
Summit.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11250-0
00:52:28.701 --> 00:52:31.021
Yeah, don't worry about that.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11266-0
00:52:31.981 --> 00:52:34.719
For example, this person is a
friend only with this guy, not

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11266-1
00:52:34.719 --> 00:52:35.571
with others, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11289-0
00:52:35.581 --> 00:52:39.060
Can I model something like that
exactly Twitter user and tweets

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11289-1
00:52:39.060 --> 00:52:41.451
likes all such, you know, things
worldwide.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11291-0
00:52:41.461 --> 00:52:42.371
Web and hyperlink?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11296-0
00:52:42.441 --> 00:52:43.011
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11298-0
00:52:43.141 --> 00:52:44.291
Any web developers?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11305-0
00:52:44.481 --> 00:52:46.491
Yeah, you do web development.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11313-0
00:52:46.941 --> 00:52:49.561
Essentially, this is a web page,
right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11320-0
00:52:49.631 --> 00:52:50.521
This is a web page.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11326-0
00:52:50.811 --> 00:52:51.861
You have a lot of content.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11357-0
00:52:51.871 --> 00:52:55.135
Maybe you have a link and that
link takes you to another web

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11357-1
00:52:55.135 --> 00:52:58.452
page and there you might have
another link which can take you

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11357-2
00:52:58.452 --> 00:52:59.361
another web page.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11376-0
00:53:00.541 --> 00:53:03.041
There can be a home button which
may again take you back to this

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11376-1
00:53:03.041 --> 00:53:03.771
web page and so on.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11397-0
00:53:04.001 --> 00:53:08.930
So this web page is become the
nodes and these battles become

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11397-1
00:53:08.930 --> 00:53:10.281
the edges, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11412-0
00:53:10.291 --> 00:53:13.551
And again, operating system
heavily uses you know your graph

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11412-1
00:53:13.551 --> 00:53:14.031
concepts.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11422-0
00:53:15.771 --> 00:53:18.981
Electronics are cutes
transportation networks, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11426-0
00:53:19.451 --> 00:53:20.721
Computer networks, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11458-0
00:53:20.731 --> 00:53:25.283
Your whole you know LAN Internet
and one can also be, you know,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11458-1
00:53:25.283 --> 00:53:29.691
looked at as a web of, you know,
graph databases, ER diagram.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11466-0
00:53:29.701 --> 00:53:31.201
There is some concept, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11476-0
00:53:31.211 --> 00:53:32.981
They're also all entities are
in.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11488-0
00:53:32.991 --> 00:53:37.256
You know your you have
triangles, you know, arrows and

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11488-1
00:53:37.256 --> 00:53:37.721
so on.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11498-0
00:53:37.731 --> 00:53:39.911
So that can also be looked at as
a graph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11500-0
00:53:41.521 --> 00:53:41.731
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11535-0
00:53:41.741 --> 00:53:45.321
Is this clear guys for all of
you, the motivation of what the

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11535-1
00:53:45.321 --> 00:53:48.958
graph is and you know what is
the S edges and some examples of

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11535-2
00:53:48.958 --> 00:53:49.131
it?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11537-0
00:53:49.191 --> 00:53:49.571
Is that clear?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11564-0
00:53:51.881 --> 00:53:54.995
And now we will look at a very
important aspect of what is the

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11564-1
00:53:54.995 --> 00:53:57.021
difference between the tree and
a graph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11577-0
00:53:58.751 --> 00:54:03.193
But right in a tree, there is
only one path between two

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11577-1
00:54:03.193 --> 00:54:04.461
vertices, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11624-0
00:54:04.951 --> 00:54:09.296
So in all these trees that we
have been seeing, for example,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11624-1
00:54:09.296 --> 00:54:13.782
if I want to go to 8, the only
way to go is from 16 to 14 from

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11624-2
00:54:13.782 --> 00:54:17.841
14 to 8, correct for any two
nodes that you pick, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11633-0
00:54:17.851 --> 00:54:19.861
For example, I want to go from 7
to 9.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11668-0
00:54:20.311 --> 00:54:24.046
What is the only route from 7 I
should go to 14 from 14 I should

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11668-1
00:54:24.046 --> 00:54:27.091
go to 16 from 16 I'll go to 10
from 10 I'll go to 9.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11682-0
00:54:28.321 --> 00:54:31.621
The crux is for any two nodes,
there's only one path between

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11682-1
00:54:31.621 --> 00:54:31.891
them.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11688-0
00:54:31.961 --> 00:54:33.201
You cannot have multiple paths.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11734-0
00:54:35.131 --> 00:54:39.137
Whereas in a graph more than one
path is allowed root node, it

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11734-1
00:54:39.137 --> 00:54:43.143
has exactly 1 root node right
always in a tree there is a root

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11734-2
00:54:43.143 --> 00:54:47.021
node, whereas graph doesn't have
a root node concept itself.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11742-0
00:54:47.511 --> 00:54:49.761
There is no dedicated root or
anything.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11757-0
00:54:50.291 --> 00:54:53.997
Yeah, loops are permitted in
graphs, whereas in trees it is

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11757-1
00:54:53.997 --> 00:54:54.861
not permitted.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11768-0
00:54:55.071 --> 00:54:57.061
You can never have a loop at
all, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11780-0
00:54:57.991 --> 00:55:01.221
There is never a shape like this
in a tree, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11784-0
00:55:01.571 --> 00:55:02.131
Is this possible?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11801-0
00:55:03.851 --> 00:55:08.657
Because two parents cannot be
there for a child right in the

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11801-1
00:55:08.657 --> 00:55:09.681
tree concept.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11825-0
00:55:10.091 --> 00:55:13.808
So you can never have a you know
cycle like this or a loop like

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11825-1
00:55:13.808 --> 00:55:14.911
this in your trees.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11835-0
00:55:16.081 --> 00:55:17.841
But as in graph you can always
have this right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11848-0
00:55:17.851 --> 00:55:20.861
For example, if you see here,
this is like a loop.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11854-0
00:55:21.021 --> 00:55:22.451
This whole thing is like a loop.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11862-0
00:55:22.461 --> 00:55:23.241
This is like a loop.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11870-0
00:55:23.251 --> 00:55:25.371
This whole square, like so many
things, are possible.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11886-0
00:55:26.971 --> 00:55:29.787
Trees are less complex compared
to graphs right traversal

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11886-1
00:55:29.787 --> 00:55:30.321
techniques.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11916-0
00:55:30.451 --> 00:55:33.779
There are three techniques that
we learned pre-order in order

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11916-1
00:55:33.779 --> 00:55:37.161
post order, whereas in graphs
there is breadth first and depth

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11916-2
00:55:37.161 --> 00:55:38.341
first number of edges.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11918-0
00:55:38.351 --> 00:55:39.041
Very important.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11935-0
00:55:39.111 --> 00:55:43.410
Yeah, there is always this
relationship, which is in minus

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11935-1
00:55:43.410 --> 00:55:44.211
one, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11956-0
00:55:44.281 --> 00:55:47.980
If there are number of nodes
exactly N minus one number of

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11956-1
00:55:47.980 --> 00:55:50.361
edges will be there in a tree,
right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11967-0
00:55:50.371 --> 00:55:52.061
I don't know if you have noticed
all this.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11977-0
00:55:52.471 --> 00:55:54.291
For example, I have a small tree
like this.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11985-0
00:55:55.521 --> 00:55:56.751
There's a binary tree correct?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/11991-0
00:55:57.851 --> 00:55:59.081
In this I have 3 notes.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12002-0
00:55:59.411 --> 00:56:01.631
How many edges are there 2 edges
are there right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12008-0
00:56:01.641 --> 00:56:02.181
This is 1.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12020-0
00:56:02.191 --> 00:56:06.361
This is 2 so there is this
relationship on any tree.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12023-0
00:56:06.371 --> 00:56:07.001
This will hold true.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12028-0
00:56:07.801 --> 00:56:08.391
Correct.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12044-0
00:56:08.441 --> 00:56:13.123
Whereas in a graph it is not
defined, I can have any number

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12044-1
00:56:13.123 --> 00:56:14.761
right and model type.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12054-0
00:56:14.771 --> 00:56:18.568
Very important tree is used for
hierarchical representation,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12054-1
00:56:18.568 --> 00:56:18.941
right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12072-0
00:56:19.051 --> 00:56:22.287
We kept on learning about that,
that, you know, hierarchy of

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12072-1
00:56:22.287 --> 00:56:23.771
your organization and so on.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12076-0
00:56:23.841 --> 00:56:24.021
Right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12097-0
00:56:24.971 --> 00:56:28.751
But as graph is used to model a
network type of a problem that

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12097-1
00:56:28.751 --> 00:56:31.031
what is used to implement the
graphs?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12103-0
00:56:31.041 --> 00:56:31.831
Yeah, we will come there.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12111-0
00:56:31.841 --> 00:56:33.071
Yeah, that's the next part.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12121-0
00:56:33.081 --> 00:56:36.081
We will learn about it in many
ways.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12124-0
00:56:36.091 --> 00:56:37.381
You can implement. Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12137-0
00:56:37.471 --> 00:56:40.391
So we will learn about all that
traversal technique of graph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12142-0
00:56:40.401 --> 00:56:41.081
Yeah, there are two.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12157-0
00:56:41.141 --> 00:56:43.711
One is called breadth first and
one is called depth first.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12178-0
00:56:44.081 --> 00:56:46.436
That is, for the next class, we
will in-depth learn about how to

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12178-1
00:56:46.436 --> 00:56:47.051
do the traversal.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12188-0
00:56:48.501 --> 00:56:50.331
He just clear at a big picture.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12196-0
00:56:50.341 --> 00:56:51.691
What is a tree and what is a
graph?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12219-0
00:56:53.761 --> 00:56:57.327
Yeah, we will look at some
examples or some terminologies

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12219-1
00:56:57.327 --> 00:56:59.601
and then we will take a short
break.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12221-0
00:57:00.501 --> 00:57:01.131
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12235-0
00:57:01.501 --> 00:57:05.872
First things first, directed
Edge directed in meaning with

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12235-1
00:57:05.872 --> 00:57:06.761
arrow right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12241-0
00:57:06.771 --> 00:57:08.221
For example, here there's an
arrow.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12252-0
00:57:09.151 --> 00:57:10.731
It is an ordered pair of
vertices.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12264-0
00:57:10.741 --> 00:57:14.861
You comma V where U is the
origin and V is the destination.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12294-0
00:57:15.251 --> 00:57:20.593
For example, there is a flight
A1206 which goes from Ord to PVB

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12294-1
00:57:20.593 --> 00:57:23.681
but does not return from PVD to
odd.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12298-0
00:57:24.911 --> 00:57:25.861
Is the one way flight.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12321-0
00:57:25.971 --> 00:57:29.735
Yeah, this is called as directed
H, meaning you can go from here

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12321-1
00:57:29.735 --> 00:57:31.471
to here, but cannot come back.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12368-0
00:57:32.931 --> 00:57:38.196
Yeah, if you have a arrow, it's
called directed Edge undirected

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12368-1
00:57:38.196 --> 00:57:42.884
edge or some people also prefer
to call it as bidirected

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12368-2
00:57:42.884 --> 00:57:48.066
bidirected, meaning there is no
arrows there, meaning from Ord

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12368-3
00:57:48.066 --> 00:57:48.641
to PVD.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12382-0
00:57:48.651 --> 00:57:51.741
Also, it is 849 miles from PVD
to Rd.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12391-0
00:57:51.751 --> 00:57:54.521
Also, it is 849 miles right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12402-0
00:57:55.091 --> 00:57:58.021
So it is undirected or
bidirected.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12407-0
00:57:58.031 --> 00:57:59.061
There are no arrows in it.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12418-0
00:57:59.271 --> 00:58:01.401
It is an unordered pair of
vertices.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12443-0
00:58:01.411 --> 00:58:05.559
You comma V you can write it as
you comma V or you can write it

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12443-1
00:58:05.559 --> 00:58:06.401
as V comma U.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12448-0
00:58:06.611 --> 00:58:07.361
Both are the same.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12450-0
00:58:07.371 --> 00:58:09.231
One cool.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12468-0
00:58:11.261 --> 00:58:15.316
And then you have directed graph
directed graph, meaning all the

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12468-1
00:58:15.316 --> 00:58:16.501
edges are directed.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12474-0
00:58:17.361 --> 00:58:18.771
All the edges are directed.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12485-0
00:58:18.781 --> 00:58:20.751
If you have arrows, then that's
a directed graph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12506-0
00:58:21.221 --> 00:58:25.603
If all the edges are undirected,
if you don't have any directions

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12506-1
00:58:25.603 --> 00:58:28.391
right, that is a undirected
graph, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12532-0
00:58:28.401 --> 00:58:30.984
So flight networks are always
directed, meaning there's arrow

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12532-1
00:58:30.984 --> 00:58:33.191
from where you know which flight
is going and so on.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12536-0
00:58:33.921 --> 00:58:35.131
It is undirected graph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12546-0
00:58:35.141 --> 00:58:36.461
It says suppose a root example.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12552-0
00:58:37.361 --> 00:58:39.291
I can always have it as
undirected.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12561-0
00:58:39.621 --> 00:58:40.691
I'll give you some analogies.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12566-0
00:58:40.701 --> 00:58:41.621
Then it will be even more clear.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12584-0
00:58:43.621 --> 00:58:47.179
A road between two points could
be one way, meaning it is

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12584-1
00:58:47.179 --> 00:58:47.731
directed.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12606-0
00:58:47.821 --> 00:58:51.616
You can go from point A to point
B, but maybe you cannot come

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12606-1
00:58:51.616 --> 00:58:52.411
back one way.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12640-0
00:58:52.421 --> 00:58:55.893
Road is called as a directed
Edge A2 Way Rd is called, isn't

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12640-1
00:58:55.893 --> 00:58:59.194
directed, meaning you can go
from A to B and you can come

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12640-2
00:58:59.194 --> 00:59:00.161
back from B to a.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12683-0
00:59:01.501 --> 00:59:04.968
So I can represent it within two
arrows like this or I can

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12683-1
00:59:04.968 --> 00:59:08.494
represent it with just a line
like this without any arrows,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12683-2
00:59:08.494 --> 00:59:11.901
which means I can go from A to B
as well as B to a right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12690-0
00:59:12.641 --> 00:59:14.131
Can have more than one edge.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12693-0
00:59:14.141 --> 00:59:15.051
Is that also possible?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12707-0
00:59:15.301 --> 00:59:18.481
Yes, from A to BI can have like
this say 10.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12717-0
00:59:18.831 --> 00:59:20.361
I can have one more with say 20.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12726-0
00:59:20.371 --> 00:59:21.761
I can have one more with say 30.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12754-0
00:59:22.451 --> 00:59:26.598
So from A to BI can go either
using the road or I can use the

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12754-1
00:59:26.598 --> 00:59:29.741
tall route or I can take a
flight route right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12772-0
00:59:29.751 --> 00:59:33.490
So multiple roads are also
possible, so multiple edges are

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12772-1
00:59:33.490 --> 00:59:35.201
possible between two nodes.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12777-0
00:59:35.411 --> 00:59:36.151
That is also possible.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12782-0
00:59:37.751 --> 00:59:38.751
So far so good, all of you.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12784-0
00:59:41.501 --> 00:59:41.641
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12790-0
00:59:44.311 --> 00:59:45.481
Simple definitions, guys.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12799-0
00:59:45.491 --> 00:59:46.971
Yeah, you should not make
mistakes here.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12807-0
00:59:48.081 --> 00:59:49.631
Adults are directed edges.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12813-0
00:59:49.861 --> 00:59:51.331
No, arrows is undirected.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12828-0
00:59:51.681 --> 00:59:55.081
If a graph has only directed
edges, it is a directed graph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12842-0
00:59:55.161 --> 00:59:58.578
If a graph has only undirected
edges, it is an undirected

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12842-1
00:59:58.578 --> 00:59:58.931
graph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12847-0
00:59:59.261 --> 01:00:00.431
We took some analogies also.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12852-0
01:00:02.131 --> 01:00:02.501
Right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12863-0
01:00:03.251 --> 01:00:04.991
We'll complete this one and then
we'll take a break.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12872-0
01:00:05.821 --> 01:00:06.531
It is very simple.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12878-0
01:00:07.781 --> 01:00:09.631
End vertices of an edge.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12884-0
01:00:10.221 --> 01:00:11.271
Yeah, very important.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12909-0
01:00:11.621 --> 01:00:14.882
You are taking an edge in your
hand, meaning a line in your

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12909-1
01:00:14.882 --> 01:00:17.761
hand and looking at who are the
two endpoints of it.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12923-0
01:00:18.591 --> 01:00:21.671
For example, if I pick up this,
A is nothing but this line.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12925-0
01:00:21.681 --> 01:00:22.341
This edge?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12936-0
01:00:22.521 --> 01:00:25.051
What type of an edge is this
real quick?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12946-0
01:00:25.951 --> 01:00:27.041
What type of an edge is that?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12951-0
01:00:27.051 --> 01:00:27.901
Is it directed or undirected?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12956-0
01:00:31.991 --> 01:00:32.341
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12959-0
01:00:32.351 --> 01:00:33.181
Undirected, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12966-0
01:00:33.191 --> 01:00:34.681
Because there is no arrows.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12968-0
01:00:35.131 --> 01:00:35.661
Perfect.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12989-0
01:00:35.851 --> 01:00:38.945
So if I take it in my hand, I
look at who are the two

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/12989-1
01:00:38.945 --> 01:00:39.861
endpoints of it?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13010-0
01:00:40.211 --> 01:00:45.140
That is nothing but you and V so
I can call SU&amp;V are end

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13010-1
01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:46.271
vertices of a.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13023-0
01:00:48.061 --> 01:00:51.051
Can you quickly explain me who
are the end vertices of F?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13031-0
01:00:53.051 --> 01:00:55.031
Who are the end vertices of F?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13033-0
01:01:00.801 --> 01:01:00.981
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13040-0
01:01:06.261 --> 01:01:07.351
WY very good.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13048-0
01:01:07.421 --> 01:01:09.651
Yeah, WY are the end vertices
of.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13052-0
01:01:09.721 --> 01:01:10.191
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13069-0
01:01:10.361 --> 01:01:15.171
So end vertices we looked then
it just incident on a vertex.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13074-0
01:01:15.241 --> 01:01:16.491
So this is exactly opposite.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13097-0
01:01:16.881 --> 01:01:21.768
Here we pick up a node or vertex
and see who all all the edges

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13097-1
01:01:21.768 --> 01:01:23.551
were touching me right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13115-0
01:01:23.561 --> 01:01:27.225
For example, if I consider this
node V right, there is a who's

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13115-1
01:01:27.225 --> 01:01:28.271
touching it there.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13132-0
01:01:28.281 --> 01:01:34.021
Is this B and there is this D so
AD&amp;B are incident on V?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13134-0
01:01:35.451 --> 01:01:36.001
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13145-0
01:01:36.051 --> 01:01:39.771
So can you tell me who all are
incident on? Why?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13154-0
01:01:41.841 --> 01:01:44.231
Who are the edges incident on?
Why?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13159-0
01:01:46.471 --> 01:01:48.951
Yeah, we all are touching.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13166-0
01:01:50.841 --> 01:01:52.951
A friend G. Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13168-0
01:01:52.961 --> 01:01:53.201
Perfect.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13186-0
01:01:54.281 --> 01:01:57.190
And then you have adjacent
vertices, meaning adjacent

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13186-1
01:01:57.190 --> 01:01:59.291
vertices are two opposite ones,
right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13208-0
01:01:59.301 --> 01:02:04.103
For example, you and we are
adjacent U NWR, adjacent W and

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13208-1
01:02:04.103 --> 01:02:05.811
XR adjacent, hence 1.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13216-0
01:02:06.101 --> 01:02:07.761
So I SU&amp;X adjacent.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13228-0
01:02:09.961 --> 01:02:11.771
I just said meaning 2 opposites
right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13255-0
01:02:11.941 --> 01:02:16.531
You will be VWWXXZXY, et cetera,
right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13266-0
01:02:16.921 --> 01:02:21.131
U&amp;X are not adjacent is U NZ
adjacent?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13278-0
01:02:23.901 --> 01:02:27.121
It's no, what about you and Z?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13280-0
01:02:27.291 --> 01:02:27.881
Are they adjacent?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13285-0
01:02:32.071 --> 01:02:32.681
No, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13294-0
01:02:32.691 --> 01:02:34.321
Because they are not, you know,
opposites.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13299-0
01:02:34.331 --> 01:02:35.711
They are not connected as well.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13310-0
01:02:37.701 --> 01:02:40.191
Degree of a vertex degree of a
vertex.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13322-0
01:02:40.201 --> 01:02:44.531
Meaning, how many edges are
incident on that vertex.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13333-0
01:02:44.781 --> 01:02:47.711
For example, if you consider X,
there is this one.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13356-0
01:02:47.961 --> 01:02:55.701
There is this 2345 right 12345
so ex is degrees five.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13361-0
01:02:56.681 --> 01:02:58.381
What is the degree of V?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13365-0
01:02:59.241 --> 01:02:59.761
Can you tell me?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13377-0
01:03:02.091 --> 01:03:04.861
Number of edges incident on a
vertex.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13387-0
01:03:05.151 --> 01:03:07.421
So for V it is this one.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13398-0
01:03:07.711 --> 01:03:11.511
It is this two this is 3 so it
is 3.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13400-0
01:03:14.871 --> 01:03:15.031
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13412-0
01:03:17.671 --> 01:03:20.821
Pull and then you have parallel
edges, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13419-0
01:03:21.211 --> 01:03:23.571
Parallel edges are nothing but
whose.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13430-0
01:03:25.781 --> 01:03:27.321
End work pieces are the same.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13455-0
01:03:28.421 --> 01:03:33.416
For example, for a H and I, the
end vertices are X comma Z or

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13455-1
01:03:33.416 --> 01:03:35.591
you can tell it AZ comma X.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13458-0
01:03:35.601 --> 01:03:37.131
It's the same, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13463-0
01:03:37.321 --> 01:03:38.911
So for X&amp;Z.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13501-0
01:03:40.721 --> 01:03:47.114
These two are the parallel
edges, so H&amp;R parallel edges

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13501-1
01:03:47.114 --> 01:03:54.039
right self loop Jesus self loop
self loop is something where the

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13501-2
01:03:54.039 --> 01:03:57.981
end vertices is the same node
right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13508-0
01:03:58.151 --> 01:03:59.431
So there's a subtle difference,
guys.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13562-0
01:04:00.281 --> 01:04:06.227
Parallel edges, meaning for H it
was Z comma X or you can tell it

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13562-1
01:04:06.227 --> 01:04:10.281
as X comma Z and for I also it
was the same.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13565-0
01:04:10.291 --> 01:04:14.180
So it takes you to the same
source and destinations, whereas

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13565-1
01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:16.921
a self loop is A1 which has only
one node.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13573-0
01:04:17.011 --> 01:04:20.471
Yeah, it goes to the same node,
yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13586-0
01:04:22.481 --> 01:04:24.291
It's no did you get this self
loop?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13591-0
01:04:24.301 --> 01:04:26.201
J is an example right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13598-0
01:04:26.731 --> 01:04:28.261
There's no no other parallel
loop.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13611-0
01:04:28.271 --> 01:04:30.381
Yeah, there is no other parallel
edge here, correct?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13642-0
01:04:31.361 --> 01:04:34.374
If I Draw Something like this
then there is a parallel edge

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13642-1
01:04:34.374 --> 01:04:37.637
right from West to why there is
F and then I can also call it as

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13642-2
01:04:37.637 --> 01:04:38.791
a P or whatever, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13646-0
01:04:38.801 --> 01:04:39.611
That is always possible.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13649-0
01:04:42.091 --> 01:04:42.601
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13657-0
01:04:42.691 --> 01:04:43.451
Is it is a node?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13660-0
01:04:43.461 --> 01:04:43.941
That's all.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13678-0
01:04:43.991 --> 01:04:48.771
Yeah, that is a node who has a
degree of 1/2 and three.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13682-0
01:04:49.821 --> 01:04:50.111
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13692-0
01:04:50.121 --> 01:04:53.571
So this whole self loop should
be counted as one only.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13709-0
01:04:53.681 --> 01:04:56.691
Yeah, you should not count as
multiple parallel element.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13713-0
01:04:56.701 --> 01:04:57.621
All road and public Rd.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13715-0
01:04:57.631 --> 01:04:58.031
Perfect.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13719-0
01:04:58.301 --> 01:04:59.251
Yeah, that's good.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13728-0
01:04:59.541 --> 01:05:01.031
Can you come up with a self loop
example?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13738-0
01:05:03.541 --> 01:05:06.081
Yeah, Speaking of that is 3
correct.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13757-0
01:05:06.091 --> 01:05:10.196
Yeah, because this is a self
loop, but some others will count

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13757-1
01:05:10.196 --> 01:05:10.791
it twice.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13761-0
01:05:10.801 --> 01:05:11.531
That's also fine.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13771-0
01:05:11.541 --> 01:05:12.731
You can also tell it as four.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13777-0
01:05:12.741 --> 01:05:13.941
I cannot deny that poor is
wrong.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13788-0
01:05:14.741 --> 01:05:18.221
Yeah, it is this 123.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13810-0
01:05:18.231 --> 01:05:20.775
You can count this also then it
is 4, but technically you should

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13810-1
01:05:20.775 --> 01:05:22.301
not count it because it's a self
loop.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13818-0
01:05:23.021 --> 01:05:25.111
Yeah, not even uturn.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13825-0
01:05:25.121 --> 01:05:26.431
Maybe I will give you an
example.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13835-0
01:05:26.901 --> 01:05:28.931
Let's say suppose you're all
rich folks.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13842-0
01:05:28.981 --> 01:05:30.901
Yeah, you have a duplex house?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13851-0
01:05:31.911 --> 01:05:34.021
Yeah, you have a duplex house
here.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13866-0
01:05:34.081 --> 01:05:37.357
You have the ground floor and
you have your steps and you have

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13866-1
01:05:37.357 --> 01:05:38.241
your first floor.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13875-0
01:05:40.211 --> 01:05:42.381
This full is your house, yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13886-0
01:05:44.521 --> 01:05:47.011
This steps is nothing but your
self loop.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13899-0
01:05:49.611 --> 01:05:51.701
It is taking you to the same
node only.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13902-0
01:05:52.211 --> 01:05:52.941
Is it making sense?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13905-0
01:05:54.851 --> 01:05:55.141
Yes.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13908-0
01:05:55.151 --> 01:05:55.361
No.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13915-0
01:05:55.371 --> 01:05:57.431
Maybe you have a house.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13928-0
01:05:57.771 --> 01:06:00.781
You're in the ground floor,
which is a node first.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13954-0
01:06:00.791 --> 01:06:03.988
Floor is also a node and this
steps is taking you from ground

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13954-1
01:06:03.988 --> 01:06:07.082
floor to 1st floor but still you
are in the same house only

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13954-2
01:06:07.082 --> 01:06:07.391
right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13964-0
01:06:07.951 --> 01:06:09.761
So I can call that as a self
loop.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13972-0
01:06:12.111 --> 01:06:13.131
So far so good, all of you.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13974-0
01:06:16.251 --> 01:06:16.551
Oops.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13979-0
01:06:21.291 --> 01:06:21.561
Cool.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13986-0
01:06:21.571 --> 01:06:22.701
Then let's take a quick break.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/13992-0
01:06:22.711 --> 01:06:23.781
It's 935 now.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14005-0
01:06:23.791 --> 01:06:27.161
We'll come back by 9:40 and we
will continue from there.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14031-0
01:06:27.611 --> 01:06:31.369
Yeah, I'll still be around if
you have any other uh queries or

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14031-1
01:06:31.369 --> 01:06:34.171
any other general things we can
talk about it.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14046-0
01:06:40.951 --> 01:06:43.721
This parallel edge is present in
bidirected graph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14050-0
01:06:43.731 --> 01:06:44.341
Yeah. It depends.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14056-0
01:06:44.351 --> 01:06:45.241
Yeah, it could be present.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14064-0
01:06:45.251 --> 01:06:46.761
It may not be present right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14084-0
01:06:46.771 --> 01:06:50.666
For example, in this graph, if I
remove this H then there will

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14084-1
01:06:50.666 --> 01:06:52.891
never be any parallel edges,
right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14092-0
01:06:53.041 --> 01:06:54.471
It depends on our graph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14102-0
01:06:54.581 --> 01:06:56.191
In both the cases it can be
there.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14105-0
01:06:56.201 --> 01:06:57.241
It might not be there.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14126-0
01:06:59.431 --> 01:07:02.175
Sir, can you please show me a
difference between tree in

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14126-1
01:07:02.175 --> 01:07:03.041
postorder in tree?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14131-0
01:07:03.231 --> 01:07:04.221
I'm a bit confused.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14134-0
01:07:04.231 --> 01:07:04.441
OK.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14146-0
01:07:04.451 --> 01:07:06.751
So we just saw very simple
example also right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14162-0
01:07:08.191 --> 01:07:11.521
If you have ABC here itself, you
will find the difference, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14186-0
01:07:11.871 --> 01:07:15.578
So if you have root left, right,
how do you can have left, right,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14186-1
01:07:15.578 --> 01:07:17.711
root or you can have left root
right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14192-0
01:07:17.951 --> 01:07:19.111
So there will be differences.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14196-0
01:07:19.121 --> 01:07:20.711
One will be nothing but BAC.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14208-0
01:07:21.751 --> 01:07:24.181
He can have a beauty or you can
have BC.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14214-0
01:07:25.121 --> 01:07:25.951
So there is a difference.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14229-0
01:07:25.961 --> 01:07:29.141
But again, I urge you to solve
that question that I've given.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14234-0
01:07:29.241 --> 01:07:31.271
There was a bigger tree, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14246-0
01:07:31.321 --> 01:07:33.751
And the solutions are in the
slide itself.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14255-0
01:07:33.861 --> 01:07:35.691
So try to draw that and see.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14262-0
01:07:35.701 --> 01:07:37.591
You know, if you're able to
match it.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14278-0
01:07:40.531 --> 01:07:42.621
If not, we will again cover that
in the Web app.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14290-0
01:07:42.631 --> 01:07:45.081
Yeah, the coming baby now will
be taken by amisha.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14299-0
01:07:45.471 --> 01:07:48.811
So she will cover maybe this
again quickly, yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14317-0
01:07:51.521 --> 01:07:54.125
But try to practice it before
the webinar so that the webinar

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14317-1
01:07:54.125 --> 01:07:54.881
makes sense, yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14324-0
01:07:59.511 --> 01:08:00.761
Yeah, reliance finance giving.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14332-0
01:08:00.771 --> 01:08:02.011
Yeah, that could also be an
exam.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14348-0
01:08:04.571 --> 01:08:09.071
Can you recap end vertices and
edge vertices?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14358-0
01:08:09.461 --> 01:08:11.681
No, there there is no edge
vertices at all.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14371-0
01:08:11.741 --> 01:08:15.041
Yeah, there is only end vertices
or edges incident.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14378-0
01:08:15.471 --> 01:08:16.431
Yeah, end vertices.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14395-0
01:08:16.441 --> 01:08:20.094
Meaning you are picking up a
node and seeing who are the two

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14395-1
01:08:20.094 --> 01:08:21.471
endpoints of it, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14409-0
01:08:21.801 --> 01:08:25.951
For example, you pick up F and
you see F is an edge, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14428-0
01:08:26.261 --> 01:08:29.651
So you now see who are the two
end work tices of this.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14435-0
01:08:29.661 --> 01:08:32.271
That is nothing but WY simple.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14470-0
01:08:32.321 --> 01:08:36.837
Those are end vertices of age,
whereas edges incident, meaning

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14470-1
01:08:36.837 --> 01:08:41.353
you are taking a node in hand
and seeing who all all the edges

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14470-2
01:08:41.353 --> 01:08:42.571
were touching me.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14483-0
01:08:42.631 --> 01:08:46.401
That is nothing but A and C Now
Amit will answer me.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14492-0
01:08:47.391 --> 01:08:50.421
What are all the edges incident
on W?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14498-0
01:08:57.201 --> 01:08:57.361
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14507-0
01:08:58.591 --> 01:09:00.771
Where all the edges incident on
W.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14511-0
01:09:03.221 --> 01:09:03.731
CD.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14514-0
01:09:03.741 --> 01:09:04.191
That's right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14535-0
01:09:04.201 --> 01:09:08.863
And then because of that, what
does the degree of W then you

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14535-1
01:09:08.863 --> 01:09:10.391
just mentioned, CDE.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14543-0
01:09:11.251 --> 01:09:12.661
So what is the degree of W?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14555-0
01:09:12.671 --> 01:09:16.061
It is 3 correct CDN E that is 3.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14587-0
01:09:16.171 --> 01:09:20.242
That is the degree of W then
that is the edges incident on a

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14587-1
01:09:20.242 --> 01:09:24.379
vertex, whereas if you want to
know the end vertices, can you

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14587-2
01:09:24.379 --> 01:09:26.381
tell me the end vertices of B?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14589-0
01:09:29.121 --> 01:09:29.281
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14591-0
01:09:31.931 --> 01:09:32.111
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14611-0
01:09:34.061 --> 01:09:37.883
I'll SRIDHANYA dos where quick
to find that and you'd also

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14611-1
01:09:37.883 --> 01:09:38.401
correct.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14620-0
01:09:38.451 --> 01:09:41.531
So CDE&amp;F is also touching
here, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14635-0
01:09:43.231 --> 01:09:49.111
So for DW the degree is 4 and it
is nothing but CDENF.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14641-0
01:09:51.591 --> 01:09:52.361
Amit, did you get this?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14677-0
01:09:56.771 --> 01:10:00.291
Yeah, VNX is correct, whereas
here in the edges incident on

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14677-1
01:10:00.291 --> 01:10:03.752
it, you are careless here in
this side, you only looked at

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14677-2
01:10:03.752 --> 01:10:04.221
the top.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14682-0
01:10:04.351 --> 01:10:05.791
And I was also, you know,
constantly.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14713-0
01:10:07.531 --> 01:10:11.927
Trying to, you know, go in the
same direction, but your friends

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14713-1
01:10:11.927 --> 01:10:16.391
correctly pointed out that CDENF
for the IT just incident on it.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14721-0
01:10:32.571 --> 01:10:33.101
To tomorrow.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14728-0
01:10:33.171 --> 01:10:33.991
So do you have any classes?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14732-0
01:10:49.971 --> 01:10:50.341
OK.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14734-0
01:10:50.351 --> 01:10:50.951
OK, nice.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14749-0
01:10:55.361 --> 01:10:58.491
If it's directional, how will
the terminologies be impacted?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14761-0
01:10:58.501 --> 01:11:00.001
Sorry, it will not be impacted,
yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14769-0
01:11:02.131 --> 01:11:03.061
It'll it'll still.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14780-0
01:11:03.111 --> 01:11:05.631
You'll have to just, you know,
concentrate on what?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14787-0
01:11:05.641 --> 01:11:06.681
The concept means right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14810-0
01:11:06.691 --> 01:11:09.650
If you take a edge, if you look
at the two endpoint of it that

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14810-1
01:11:09.650 --> 01:11:10.401
is end, what is?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14831-0
01:11:10.911 --> 01:11:14.206
If you look at, you know edges
incident will slightly vary

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14831-1
01:11:14.206 --> 01:11:17.501
where there will be few more
definitions called in degree.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14850-0
01:11:17.511 --> 01:11:21.031
What this is and out degree in
degree means who's coming

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14850-1
01:11:21.031 --> 01:11:21.771
towards you?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14858-0
01:11:21.781 --> 01:11:23.431
How degree means who's going
away from you?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14862-0
01:11:24.511 --> 01:11:24.811
Great.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14870-0
01:11:26.271 --> 01:11:27.391
When the time comes, you will
log.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14873-0
01:11:27.401 --> 01:11:28.191
Yeah, don't worry about that.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14891-0
01:11:34.521 --> 01:11:36.650
That I'm trying to reach
management via email ticket for

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14891-1
01:11:36.650 --> 01:11:37.471
enabling online exams.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14898-0
01:11:37.481 --> 01:11:39.831
Since I have permanent residence
in uh. OK.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14900-0
01:11:39.841 --> 01:11:40.041
OK.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14906-0
01:11:40.801 --> 01:11:41.281
Ohh.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14911-0
01:11:42.011 --> 01:11:43.731
Or the best way to prioritize my
request?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14950-0
01:11:43.781 --> 01:11:47.006
Yeah, I can the same email ID
initially if you remember

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14950-1
01:11:47.006 --> 01:11:50.692
SANTHOSH, I had put an email ID
right OPS you can write to them

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14950-2
01:11:50.692 --> 01:11:53.802
and let's see you know that
should be faster than the

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14950-3
01:11:53.802 --> 01:11:55.011
support ticket. Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14953-0

Due to much class work where we
in our office, uh no excitement

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14978-1
01:12:03.202 --> 01:12:04.451
about New Year to have a class.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14985-0
01:12:04.461 --> 01:12:05.661
Tomorrow will not make a
difference.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/14989-0
01:12:05.671 --> 01:12:06.391

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15150-0
01:12:56.451 --> 01:12:58.361
Yeah, just that you are looking
at in the wrong place.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15168-0
01:12:59.651 --> 01:13:04.216
I have repeated this right from
the Python class, so please

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15168-1
01:13:04.216 --> 01:13:05.281
don't go here.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15174-0
01:13:05.291 --> 01:13:06.161
You are in Section 2.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15180-0
01:13:07.011 --> 01:13:08.321
You're in Section 1, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15204-0
01:13:08.551 --> 01:13:12.455
So you'll have to go into
section one and inside that you

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15204-1
01:13:12.455 --> 01:13:14.541
will be able to see the slides.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15211-0
01:13:14.591 --> 01:13:16.031
Yeah, you're looking in the
wrong place.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15237-0
01:13:23.721 --> 01:13:26.085
Well, I think let's get started
and if there's any time left at

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15237-1
01:13:26.085 --> 01:13:27.451
the end, how we can again chit
chat?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15240-0
01:13:27.461 --> 01:13:29.281
Yeah, cool.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15247-0
01:13:29.291 --> 01:13:30.061
Now, what is a part?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15253-0
01:13:30.751 --> 01:13:32.441
Yeah, that is very simple.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15266-0
01:13:32.751 --> 01:13:37.164
Yeah, it's a sequence of
alternating vertices and edges,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15266-1
01:13:37.164 --> 01:13:37.551
yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15274-0
01:13:41.111 --> 01:13:42.331
Yeah, there were some questions.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15278-0
01:13:42.611 --> 01:13:42.871
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15286-0
01:13:42.881 --> 01:13:45.101
We will take all those, you
know, things later.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15295-0
01:13:45.111 --> 01:13:49.081
Yeah, all of you back again, are
you back?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15306-0
01:13:54.351 --> 01:13:56.121
Other shared, you know, got an
important point.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15322-0
01:13:56.131 --> 01:14:01.253
So all of you your assignment
question will be a big PDF

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15322-1
01:14:01.253 --> 01:14:02.061
document.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15346-0
01:14:02.291 --> 01:14:05.353
Yeah, for at least I'm not sure
about any other course, but for

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15346-1
01:14:05.353 --> 01:14:07.361
this course you will have a PDF
document.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15353-0
01:14:07.811 --> 01:14:08.951
You will be working in groups.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15359-0
01:14:09.881 --> 01:14:12.331
First things first, download
that PDF.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15366-0
01:14:12.661 --> 01:14:14.611
Read every line of it.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15369-0
01:14:14.841 --> 01:14:15.631
I again repeat.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15377-0
01:14:15.781 --> 01:14:17.541
Please read every line of it.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15396-0
01:14:18.141 --> 01:14:21.491
There are many nuances given in
that and everything will be

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15396-1
01:14:21.491 --> 01:14:22.831
given in the assignment.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15409-0
01:14:23.141 --> 01:14:25.890
The question the sample input,
the sample output, what is the

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15409-1
01:14:25.890 --> 01:14:26.821
deliverable expected?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15419-0
01:14:28.021 --> 01:14:30.071
What type of files you need to
submit?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15428-0
01:14:30.161 --> 01:14:31.691
How should you name that file?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15436-0
01:14:32.141 --> 01:14:35.311
Every detail will be available
in that document.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15447-0
01:14:35.641 --> 01:14:37.781
It will be a good four to five
pages.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15470-0
01:14:37.961 --> 01:14:41.198
The question itself, yeah, your
solution might be just one page,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15470-1
01:14:41.198 --> 01:14:42.691
but the question is 4-5 pages.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15481-0
01:14:44.001 --> 01:14:47.401
I would urge you not to start
the assignment before reading

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15481-1
01:14:47.401 --> 01:14:47.571
it.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15499-0
01:14:47.701 --> 01:14:51.260
Yeah, completely read the five
page document because there are

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15499-1
01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:51.711
mishaps.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15504-0
01:14:52.361 --> 01:14:53.021
There is a way.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15509-0
01:14:53.031 --> 01:14:54.431
You need to name the assignment.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15516-0
01:14:54.501 --> 01:14:55.211
There is a way.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15527-0
01:14:55.261 --> 01:14:57.441
You need to, you know, submit a
format right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15538-0
01:14:57.451 --> 01:14:59.291
For example, you need to write a
Python file.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15547-0
01:14:59.581 --> 01:15:02.001
You need to submit an excel
sheet whatever, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15556-0
01:15:03.941 --> 01:15:05.271
The evaluation will be.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15565-0
01:15:08.271 --> 01:15:09.781
Exactly as per the rubric.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15588-0
01:15:10.391 --> 01:15:12.812
If you have done the exact
correct solution, but you have

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15588-1
01:15:12.812 --> 01:15:15.441
not named it according to the
Convention, you will get a zero.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15596-0
01:15:16.481 --> 01:15:17.991
Please do not write emails.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15599-0
01:15:18.001 --> 01:15:18.751
Don't you know?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15611-0
01:15:18.761 --> 01:15:20.711
Ask later that you know I have
done well.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15618-0
01:15:20.721 --> 01:15:22.401
I this was an oversight and so
on.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15634-0
01:15:24.311 --> 01:15:27.781
Ask me, the evaluation will be
exactly as per the rubric.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15646-0
01:15:28.231 --> 01:15:30.681
Whatever is given in the
document, it will be evaluated

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15646-1
01:15:30.681 --> 01:15:31.031
on that.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15654-0
01:15:31.951 --> 01:15:34.161
Yeah, I'll not be.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15660-0
01:15:34.171 --> 01:15:35.681
You know, so evaluations.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15666-0
01:15:35.691 --> 01:15:37.691
I'll be ruthless in that exam.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15670-0
01:15:37.701 --> 01:15:38.661
Evaluation is different.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15682-0
01:15:38.671 --> 01:15:40.831
Yeah, of course all your answers
are encouraged.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15708-0
01:15:40.911 --> 01:15:44.379
If you are taking the right
direction, you might still find

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15708-1
01:15:44.379 --> 01:15:47.904
marks, so I know some leniency
will be there, but this is an

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15708-2
01:15:47.904 --> 01:15:48.481
open book.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15754-0
01:15:48.531 --> 01:15:52.015
You have 15 days of time and if
you have not read the PDF

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15754-1
01:15:52.015 --> 01:15:55.618
document and if you make silly
mistakes like you know wrong

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15754-2
01:15:55.618 --> 01:15:58.981
naming conventions or wrong
formats, right instead of a

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15754-3
01:15:58.981 --> 01:15:59.701
Python file.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15765-0
01:15:59.711 --> 01:16:02.181
If you upload a Java file, it
will not be even evaluated.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15771-0
01:16:02.231 --> 01:16:03.161
Yeah, right away.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15780-0
01:16:03.171 --> 01:16:04.301
It will be even as a zero.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15783-0
01:16:05.721 --> 01:16:05.971
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15792-0
01:16:05.981 --> 01:16:06.991
Is it clear for all of you?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15798-0
01:16:07.051 --> 01:16:07.991
Yeah, that's a good point.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15802-0
01:16:08.001 --> 01:16:08.891
That other Schmidt?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15816-0
01:16:09.821 --> 01:16:13.201
Yeah, it's not to scare you, but
that is the fact.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15835-0
01:16:13.251 --> 01:16:16.505
Yeah, there are plenty of times
I have done this and that is

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15835-1
01:16:16.505 --> 01:16:17.891
share carelessness, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15866-0
01:16:17.901 --> 01:16:21.220
I mean, if you don't read the
question properly and if you

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15866-1
01:16:21.220 --> 01:16:24.820
just start attempting it, and if
you make mistakes, then I mean

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15866-2
01:16:24.820 --> 01:16:26.901
that's, you know, pure
carelessness.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15871-0
01:16:28.511 --> 01:16:28.871
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15876-0
01:16:28.881 --> 01:16:29.101
Yes.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15878-0
01:16:29.111 --> 01:16:29.331
No.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15892-0
01:16:29.341 --> 01:16:32.241
Do you all agree that you will
read the full document and

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15892-1
01:16:32.241 --> 01:16:32.991
adhere to that?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15899-0
01:16:35.611 --> 01:16:36.691
Yeah, I don't see any place.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15911-0
01:16:38.651 --> 01:16:42.281
Yeah, it will be a big PDF
document.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15928-0
01:16:42.291 --> 01:16:45.641
Read it fully every detail that
you need will be in that, yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15945-0
01:16:45.651 --> 01:16:48.208
If you have any doubts while you
do your assignment, what do you

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15945-1
01:16:48.208 --> 01:16:48.561
do right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15950-0
01:16:48.571 --> 01:16:49.661
You should not write emails.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15967-0
01:16:49.811 --> 01:16:53.641
Yeah, you will read in that PDF
there is a way to ask the DAS.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15984-0
01:16:53.651 --> 01:16:57.563
Yeah, there will be a discussion
thread dedicated for every

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15984-1
01:16:57.563 --> 01:16:58.541
question India.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/15998-0
01:16:58.551 --> 01:17:00.981
One more thing is not all of you
will get the same question.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16006-0
01:17:01.451 --> 01:17:03.001
Yeah, it's a pool of questions.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16014-0
01:17:03.471 --> 01:17:06.111
Each group will get different
different questions, yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16026-0
01:17:08.281 --> 01:17:10.741
Anything you write to me, uh,
no, nothing against that.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16028-0
01:17:10.751 --> 01:17:11.051
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16049-0
01:17:11.061 --> 01:17:14.516
So I'm just warning you that
please be very careful that all

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16049-1
01:17:14.516 --> 01:17:16.781
these subtle things also matter,
right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16073-0
01:17:16.841 --> 01:17:20.748
So I understand that the bigger
picture is learning and you know

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16073-1
01:17:20.748 --> 01:17:22.791
you want to solve the
assignment.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16087-0
01:17:22.801 --> 01:17:25.671
You need to have fun solving it
and all that completely agreed.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16096-0
01:17:26.161 --> 01:17:28.721
But still you are in an academic
framework, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16127-0
01:17:28.731 --> 01:17:32.174
You wear the hat of a student,
at least for some time, and it

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16127-1
01:17:32.174 --> 01:17:35.728
is absolutely needed that you'll
have to adhere to these things

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16127-2
01:17:35.728 --> 01:17:36.061
right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16149-0
01:17:36.371 --> 01:17:40.014
Submitting a wrong document and
plagiarizing and then telling

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16149-1
01:17:40.014 --> 01:17:43.480
that you know, unknowingly, I
copied, so those will not be

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16149-2
01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:44.361
accepted, yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16153-0
01:17:46.491 --> 01:17:46.811
Cool.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16166-0
01:17:46.861 --> 01:17:49.086
That being said, let's get
started again and we will look

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16166-1
01:17:49.086 --> 01:17:49.431
at these.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16170-0
01:17:49.441 --> 01:17:49.731
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16179-0
01:17:49.741 --> 01:17:50.671
And in the next class.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16192-0
01:17:50.681 --> 01:17:53.871
So before our end deadline, we
have another class as well.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16213-0
01:17:54.081 --> 01:17:56.967
So in that class I will again
open one assignment and explain

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16213-1
01:17:56.967 --> 01:17:59.061
it as to what all are there in
the question.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16215-0
01:17:59.941 --> 01:18:00.121
Right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16217-0
01:18:01.561 --> 01:18:01.851
Cool.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16225-0
01:18:01.861 --> 01:18:03.181
What is the path path?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16234-0
01:18:03.191 --> 01:18:06.901
Is a sequence of alternating or
kisses and edges right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16239-0
01:18:07.251 --> 01:18:07.921
So what is that?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16245-0
01:18:07.931 --> 01:18:09.041
It begins with our text.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16255-0
01:18:09.051 --> 01:18:10.061
It ends with a vertex.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16266-0
01:18:10.301 --> 01:18:12.771
Each edge is preceded and
followed by its endpoints.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16274-0
01:18:14.321 --> 01:18:15.311
So again, there is.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16288-0
01:18:15.321 --> 01:18:18.881
So for example, I can just, uh,
just cook up an example for you.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16299-0
01:18:21.081 --> 01:18:26.921
He be be see something like
that.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16322-0
01:18:28.821 --> 01:18:31.655
This is an example of a path
right from a I'm taking this

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16322-1
01:18:31.655 --> 01:18:32.631
edge and going to B.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16333-0
01:18:32.781 --> 01:18:35.531
Then I'm taking this edge C and
I'm going to D and so on, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16358-0
01:18:35.641 --> 01:18:39.712
Any of these I can do, which is
a path simple path path such

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16358-1
01:18:39.712 --> 01:18:42.781
that all its vertices and edges
are distinct.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16366-0
01:18:42.991 --> 01:18:43.971
Let's take an example.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16383-0
01:18:44.431 --> 01:18:47.541
If you look at this P1 right,
how will you name this P1?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16409-0
01:18:47.871 --> 01:18:52.773
You started with V and then you
took B and from V you reached X

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16409-1
01:18:52.773 --> 01:18:56.601
from X you reached H and from
high you went to Z.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16416-0
01:18:56.791 --> 01:18:58.521
So this is a simple path.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16418-0
01:19:00.421 --> 01:19:00.581
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16430-0
01:19:02.391 --> 01:19:03.621
Path is very simple Raja.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16438-0
01:19:03.631 --> 01:19:05.421
You just start with some vertex.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16449-0
01:19:05.611 --> 01:19:08.801
You start going along a path
that is a path, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16469-0
01:19:08.811 --> 01:19:12.767
For example, if I start with V
from VI took this edge BI

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16469-1
01:19:12.767 --> 01:19:13.461
reached X.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16474-0
01:19:13.511 --> 01:19:14.781
From there I took Ch.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16485-0
01:19:14.831 --> 01:19:16.471
I reached set so this is called
a path.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16488-0
01:19:18.171 --> 01:19:18.651
Is this clear?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16491-0
01:19:21.921 --> 01:19:22.221
Yes.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16493-0
01:19:22.231 --> 01:19:22.591
No, maybe.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16499-0
01:19:25.361 --> 01:19:25.521
Cool.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16512-0
01:19:27.271 --> 01:19:30.884
And in this path, once you wrote
it, are there any duplicates in

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16512-1
01:19:30.884 --> 01:19:31.161
this?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16515-0
01:19:33.501 --> 01:19:33.791
Yes.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16519-0
01:19:33.801 --> 01:19:33.881
No.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16523-0
01:19:35.021 --> 01:19:35.951
Are there any duplicates?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16527-0
01:19:37.521 --> 01:19:37.831
No.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16534-0
01:19:38.301 --> 01:19:39.731
Then this is called a simple
path.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16542-0
01:19:40.181 --> 01:19:41.611
Now let me draw another path.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16550-0
01:19:41.621 --> 01:19:43.541
Yeah, look at it carefully.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16560-0
01:19:44.631 --> 01:19:47.901
This particular diagram right
you start with you.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16568-0
01:19:48.631 --> 01:19:51.221
You go to W and then to ex.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16583-0
01:19:51.271 --> 01:19:54.921
I go to G again, come back to
WI, go to V right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16595-0
01:19:54.931 --> 01:19:57.001
If you write it in path, it'll
be like this, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16601-0
01:19:57.351 --> 01:19:58.241
You start it from you.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16608-0
01:19:58.251 --> 01:20:00.191
You went to the, you know, Etsy.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16638-0
01:20:00.201 --> 01:20:04.857
You went to W, you took the
edge, you went to X, took the

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16638-1
01:20:04.857 --> 01:20:09.351
edge G, went to Y, took the
edge, F went to W then DEV.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16646-0
01:20:10.021 --> 01:20:11.911
So in this, are there any
duplicates?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16650-0
01:20:14.771 --> 01:20:15.261
Yep, peace.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16657-0
01:20:15.271 --> 01:20:16.051
Focus here, Raja.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16661-0
01:20:16.061 --> 01:20:16.461
All of you.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16680-0
01:20:16.471 --> 01:20:18.740
I'll show you again, this is the
end time I have shown, but

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16680-1
01:20:18.740 --> 01:20:19.761
again, I'll show you later.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16688-0
01:20:19.771 --> 01:20:21.821
But now, please focus all of you
here.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16693-0
01:20:21.831 --> 01:20:23.151
Yeah, it's very important.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16696-0
01:20:25.231 --> 01:20:25.521
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16707-0
01:20:25.531 --> 01:20:27.001
So in this there are duplicates
right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16715-0
01:20:27.011 --> 01:20:28.741
There is a W here which is
repeating.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16717-0
01:20:28.991 --> 01:20:29.441
Correct.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16729-0
01:20:29.571 --> 01:20:31.541
So then this is not a simple
path.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16737-0
01:20:31.931 --> 01:20:33.831
Some people prefer to call it a
complex path.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16749-0
01:20:35.191 --> 01:20:37.521
Yeah, you know, what is the
cycle?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16752-0
01:20:39.041 --> 01:20:40.691
Circular sequencing, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16761-0
01:20:40.701 --> 01:20:43.551
Circular sequence of alternating
vertices and edges.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16767-0
01:20:43.861 --> 01:20:44.691
That is the cycle.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16779-0
01:20:45.161 --> 01:20:48.201
For example, let's draw that you
see the green one.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16784-0
01:20:48.971 --> 01:20:49.891
You start from B.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16794-0
01:20:50.571 --> 01:20:51.911
You take this route B.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16806-0
01:20:51.951 --> 01:20:56.081
You go from V2X to YY2WW to you
U2V.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16819-0
01:20:56.411 --> 01:20:59.941
So you started and rotated and
came back to the same place.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16836-0
01:21:00.431 --> 01:21:03.452
And here that last place you
will just mark it like this,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16836-1
01:21:03.452 --> 01:21:04.701
like an enter character.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16872-0
01:21:05.211 --> 01:21:10.117
It means that you came back to
the same place right from V you

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16872-1
01:21:10.117 --> 01:21:14.711
went to X2Y2WW to you, and then
you took this A till this.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16875-0
01:21:14.721 --> 01:21:14.821
A.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16878-0
01:21:14.831 --> 01:21:15.511
You'll mention it.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16896-0
01:21:15.911 --> 01:21:19.207
It simply means you came back to
that same place and in this are

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16896-1
01:21:19.207 --> 01:21:20.271
there any duplicates?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16912-0
01:21:22.571 --> 01:21:25.801
No, there are no duplicates, so
this is called a simple cycle.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16920-0
01:21:26.821 --> 01:21:28.111
Now let's draw another cycle.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16928-0
01:21:29.511 --> 01:21:31.481
Yeah, just like an 8, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16934-0
01:21:31.491 --> 01:21:32.801
It's going like this, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16962-0
01:21:33.111 --> 01:21:36.496
So if you see here from view we
went to W then to X, then to Y,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16962-1
01:21:36.496 --> 01:21:38.981
then to W, then to V again, you
are back here.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16980-0
01:21:39.531 --> 01:21:43.277
But in this also there is this W
that is repeating, so it is not

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16980-1
01:21:43.277 --> 01:21:44.141
a simple cycle.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16984-0
01:21:46.461 --> 01:21:46.691
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16991-0
01:21:46.701 --> 01:21:47.171
Is this clear?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/16994-0
01:21:47.181 --> 01:21:47.711
Guys, all of you.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17001-0
01:21:48.491 --> 01:21:49.201
What is the cycle?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17027-0
01:21:50.081 --> 01:21:53.527
You start from our tax for a
node, you take a lot of edges,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17027-1
01:21:53.527 --> 01:21:56.571
you rotate and you come back
there right a triangle.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17036-0
01:21:56.581 --> 01:21:58.511
Also you can consider like that
right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17041-0
01:21:58.961 --> 01:21:59.941
So you start from here.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17044-0
01:21:59.951 --> 01:22:00.271
You go.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17058-0
01:22:00.281 --> 01:22:03.021
Here you again go to this node,
you come back to this node.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17067-0
01:22:03.031 --> 01:22:04.011
This is also a cycle.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17088-0
01:22:04.661 --> 01:22:08.419
If you start, is it some other
nodes and come back to the same

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17088-1
01:22:08.419 --> 01:22:09.731
node, that is a cycle.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17106-0
01:22:10.871 --> 01:22:14.241
It's no all of you and you just
react or put in.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17110-0
01:22:14.251 --> 01:22:15.061
The fact is this clear.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17114-0
01:22:18.311 --> 01:22:19.311
Both and cycle.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17117-0
01:22:21.411 --> 01:22:21.611
Cool.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17132-0
01:22:23.071 --> 01:22:25.546
Now let's look at this one
concrete example which has a lot

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17132-1
01:22:25.546 --> 01:22:26.041
of concepts.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17142-0
01:22:26.931 --> 01:22:31.361
All these black dots are called
as nodes, correct?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17151-0
01:22:31.851 --> 01:22:34.051
This is an example of an edge
these lines.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17168-0
01:22:35.901 --> 01:22:38.261
Do you see this Gray color
highlighted portion here?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17181-0
01:22:39.561 --> 01:22:42.411
All of you are able to see this,
this part alone.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17188-0
01:22:42.421 --> 01:22:43.801
Or maybe I can highlight it for
you.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17193-0
01:22:46.051 --> 01:22:46.791
This part alone.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17199-0
01:22:48.901 --> 01:22:49.341
Right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17202-0
01:22:49.501 --> 01:22:50.211
I can call it.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17226-0
01:22:50.221 --> 01:22:53.816
This is a path of length 4
because if you see here there

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17226-1
01:22:53.816 --> 01:22:56.401
are four edges involved, right
this one.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17230-0
01:22:56.451 --> 01:22:57.021
This is 2.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17236-0
01:22:57.031 --> 01:22:57.481
This is 3.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17245-0
01:22:57.491 --> 01:22:59.411
This is 4, so this is a path of
length 4.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17255-0
01:23:01.401 --> 01:23:04.251
This is a cycle of length file,
right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17267-0
01:23:04.461 --> 01:23:06.251
No, there is no self loop and so
on.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17271-0
01:23:06.261 --> 01:23:06.581
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17278-0
01:23:06.661 --> 01:23:07.701
Yeah, self loop is a cycle.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17281-0
01:23:07.711 --> 01:23:08.191
That's right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17300-0
01:23:08.241 --> 01:23:12.579
Correct, all cycles are not self
loops, but all self loops are

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17300-1
01:23:12.579 --> 01:23:13.061
cycles.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17306-0
01:23:14.951 --> 01:23:16.041
Is that correct Chauhan?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17314-0
01:23:17.871 --> 01:23:18.861
So this is the cycle, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17320-0
01:23:18.871 --> 01:23:19.861
You start in this node.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17325-0
01:23:20.191 --> 01:23:21.141
You go to this part.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17327-0
01:23:21.191 --> 01:23:21.871
Go here.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17330-0
01:23:21.881 --> 01:23:22.321
Go here.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17335-0
01:23:22.331 --> 01:23:22.681
Go here.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17337-0
01:23:22.691 --> 01:23:24.021
Come back. Right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17355-0
01:23:24.271 --> 01:23:26.981
So this is a cycle, but this is
not a self loop.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17368-0
01:23:28.061 --> 01:23:30.711
Whereas if you have a self loop,
that's always a cycle, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17380-0
01:23:30.721 --> 01:23:33.661
I can have something like this,
so that's the cycle.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17400-0
01:23:35.151 --> 01:23:39.426
The vertex of degree three,
meaning this node has three

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17400-1
01:23:39.426 --> 01:23:42.861
different edges, so it's degrees
three cool.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17408-0
01:23:42.871 --> 01:23:44.621
So this connected component will
come later.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17422-0
01:23:44.671 --> 01:23:47.111
Yeah, we will look at this
definition further.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17427-0
01:23:47.201 --> 01:23:48.821
But is this definition clear so
far?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17434-0
01:23:49.721 --> 01:23:51.811
What is a node or vertex?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17439-0
01:23:51.821 --> 01:23:52.551
What is an edge?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17444-0
01:23:52.561 --> 01:23:53.561
What is the degree?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17449-0
01:23:53.571 --> 01:23:55.541
What is the cycle?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17460-0
01:23:55.821 --> 01:23:59.421
What is it just incident on our
vertex?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17465-0
01:23:59.431 --> 01:24:00.251
All of this is it clear.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17471-0
01:24:01.851 --> 01:24:02.891
Amit, Simran, all of you.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17482-0
01:24:06.081 --> 01:24:07.891
OK, let's also look at some
graph types.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17491-0
01:24:07.951 --> 01:24:09.881
Yeah, this might be also
interesting.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17498-0
01:24:11.391 --> 01:24:12.801
This is called a null graph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17502-0
01:24:13.001 --> 01:24:13.281
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17514-0
01:24:13.291 --> 01:24:15.361
So all these are for your MCQS
and so on.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17529-0
01:24:15.371 --> 01:24:19.821
Yeah, a graph that has no edges
is called a null graph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17531-0
01:24:21.351 --> 01:24:21.511
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17545-0
01:24:22.821 --> 01:24:27.253
Can I say that all the planetary
system, maybe something like

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17545-1
01:24:27.253 --> 01:24:27.681
stars?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17551-0
01:24:28.571 --> 01:24:29.431
Are they an all graph?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17560-0
01:24:32.001 --> 01:24:33.481
Is there paths between those
stars?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17565-0
01:24:34.641 --> 01:24:36.251
We don't know. Maybe.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17571-0
01:24:38.121 --> 01:24:39.111
Yeah, null graph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17583-0
01:24:39.121 --> 01:24:40.921
What is another example that you
can come up with?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17595-0
01:24:42.651 --> 01:24:46.701
They're all nodes, but there is
no path between them, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17602-0
01:24:47.191 --> 01:24:48.551
Can I also consider some island?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17607-0
01:24:50.191 --> 01:24:50.961
Yeah, Ireland.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17620-0
01:24:50.971 --> 01:24:53.291
Also, you can always argue that
no there is a flight and all

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17620-1
01:24:53.291 --> 01:24:53.481
that.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17622-0
01:24:53.491 --> 01:24:53.651
Right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17639-0
01:24:54.381 --> 01:24:59.423
Cool reveal graph a graph with
only one vertex is called as a

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17639-1
01:24:59.423 --> 01:25:00.561
trivial graph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17645-0
01:25:01.521 --> 01:25:02.491
Yeah, what could be an example?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17656-0
01:25:05.771 --> 01:25:08.911
Yeah, getting consider the
universe to be a trivial graph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17659-0
01:25:11.551 --> 01:25:11.951
Yes. No.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17662-0
01:25:14.091 --> 01:25:14.541
Which route?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17673-0
01:25:16.721 --> 01:25:19.161
The whole graph we are talking
about Krishna, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17684-0
01:25:20.931 --> 01:25:23.221
There's only one node in the
whole graph, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17692-0
01:25:23.391 --> 01:25:25.161
An example could be the
universe, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17705-0
01:25:26.181 --> 01:25:28.901
We don't know about Earth and so
on, but the universe probably.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17717-0
01:25:28.911 --> 01:25:32.911
Yeah, the whole universe can be
considered as one node, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17728-0
01:25:33.161 --> 01:25:37.191
That's the trivial graph
undirected graph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17773-0
01:25:37.231 --> 01:25:41.010
You already know it, or I can
also call it is by directed the

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17773-1
01:25:41.010 --> 01:25:44.606
graph that contains edges, but
the edges are not directed,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17773-2
01:25:44.606 --> 01:25:48.201
meaning I can go from A to BI
can go from B to a that's an

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17773-3
01:25:48.201 --> 01:25:50.151
undirected graph directed graph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17797-0
01:25:50.191 --> 01:25:53.562
A graph that contains edges
which have direction right from

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17797-1
01:25:53.562 --> 01:25:56.371
A to BI can go, but I cannot go
back from B to a.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17807-0
01:25:57.291 --> 01:25:58.281
Is the question Simon asked.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17812-0
01:25:58.291 --> 01:25:59.871
Trivial graph will have one
node.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17816-0
01:25:59.981 --> 01:26:00.761
What about edges?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17825-0
01:26:00.771 --> 01:26:01.981
Is it 0 or any number?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17835-0
01:26:01.991 --> 01:26:05.091
It is 0 correct because not
having any edges at all.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17844-0
01:26:05.681 --> 01:26:08.111
Yeah, everything is encompassed
in that node alone.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17850-0
01:26:08.201 --> 01:26:09.201
That's it, right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17852-0
01:26:09.211 --> 01:26:09.821
There are no edges.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17855-0
01:26:11.681 --> 01:26:11.921
Good.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17862-0
01:26:13.041 --> 01:26:14.521
What about a simple graph?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17880-0
01:26:14.801 --> 01:26:18.980
A simple graph is a graph that
contains no loops and no

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17880-1
01:26:18.980 --> 01:26:20.621
parallel edges, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17896-0
01:26:20.691 --> 01:26:24.241
For example, in this, if you see
there are no loops in it.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17912-0
01:26:24.291 --> 01:26:27.296
I can start from a I'll go to C
I'll go to B, but I'll get

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17912-1
01:26:27.296 --> 01:26:27.601
stuck.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17927-0
01:26:27.651 --> 01:26:32.831
I cannot come back to a right,
so there is no loop here.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17935-0
01:26:32.841 --> 01:26:34.251
There is no self loop here.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17942-0
01:26:34.361 --> 01:26:35.071
There is no cycle.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17950-0
01:26:35.081 --> 01:26:37.071
Also here there are no parallel
edges.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17962-0
01:26:37.081 --> 01:26:41.641
Also, right from between each
nodes they are only one edge.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17976-0
01:26:41.851 --> 01:26:44.791
There are no multiple ones, so
that is a simple graph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17984-0
01:26:45.251 --> 01:26:46.551
It can have a self loop edge.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/17992-0
01:26:46.561 --> 01:26:47.261
Which one swapna?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18003-0
01:26:48.981 --> 01:26:53.111
A simple graph cannot have it,
but which one did you ask?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18008-0
01:26:56.431 --> 01:26:56.941
Trivial graph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18016-0
01:26:56.951 --> 01:26:58.841
No, trivial graph should not
have any edge.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18027-0
01:26:59.351 --> 01:27:01.061
Yeah, it is just one node.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18031-0
01:27:01.311 --> 01:27:03.661
That's that's a trivial graph,
right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18036-0
01:27:05.931 --> 01:27:06.781
And many more.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18038-0
01:27:06.791 --> 01:27:07.041
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18064-0
01:27:07.051 --> 01:27:10.441
So there are many, many types of
other graphs like, you know, uh

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18064-1
01:27:10.441 --> 01:27:13.571
bipartite graphs, Hamiltonian
graphs, you know, things like

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18064-2
01:27:13.571 --> 01:27:13.831
that.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18083-0
01:27:15.711 --> 01:27:18.936
So which of the below is a
simple graph even for a null

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18083-1
01:27:18.936 --> 01:27:19.281
graph?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18087-0
01:27:19.291 --> 01:27:19.911
No edges, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18099-0
01:27:19.921 --> 01:27:23.721
Correct, but there you have
multiple nodes at least, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18120-0
01:27:23.811 --> 01:27:27.797
You have multiple nodes, but
they are not connected, whereas

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18120-1
01:27:27.797 --> 01:27:31.651
in trivial graph number of nodes
itself is just one, yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18130-0
01:27:33.571 --> 01:27:35.281
Which of the below is a simple
graph?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18136-0
01:27:37.601 --> 01:27:39.131
Yeah, 1 two or three.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18143-0
01:27:41.521 --> 01:27:42.441
Yeah, none of them is wrong.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18152-0
01:27:44.731 --> 01:27:47.001
This definition says no loops
only.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18174-0
01:27:47.051 --> 01:27:52.061
Yeah, no loops, meaning self
loop, no self loop, no parallel

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18174-1
01:27:52.061 --> 01:27:54.031
edge cycle can be there.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18182-0
01:27:55.331 --> 01:27:56.911
First one very good it's a
simple graph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18194-0
01:27:57.931 --> 01:27:59.621
What about the second one and
third one?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18226-0
01:27:59.631 --> 01:28:02.813
They're not simple, but why this
one is not a simple graph

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18226-1
01:28:02.813 --> 01:28:06.318
because of which reason, because
of parallel edges between these

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18226-2
01:28:06.318 --> 01:28:07.881
two nodes there is this edge.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18234-0
01:28:07.891 --> 01:28:09.821
There is also this extra
additional edge.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18240-0
01:28:10.051 --> 01:28:11.441
Similarly here there is a edge.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18271-0
01:28:11.451 --> 01:28:15.164
There is another extra edge
here, taking to the same nodes,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18271-1
01:28:15.164 --> 01:28:18.753
so there is a the non simple
graph with multiple edges or

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18271-2
01:28:18.753 --> 01:28:19.681
parallel edges.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18288-0
01:28:20.091 --> 01:28:23.876
The last one it is not a simple
graph because there is a self

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18288-1
01:28:23.876 --> 01:28:24.181
loop.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18297-0
01:28:24.191 --> 01:28:25.381
There are two self loops here.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18306-0
01:28:26.971 --> 01:28:29.661
Well, so are all these concepts
clear guys?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18330-0
01:28:31.881 --> 01:28:38.633
Node Vertex, Edge, directed,
undirected cycle path, degree

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18330-1
01:28:38.633 --> 01:28:42.981
right adjacent self loop cycle
right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18335-0
01:28:42.991 --> 01:28:44.691
All these things pull.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18340-0
01:28:46.031 --> 01:28:47.011
What is a subgraph?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18344-0
01:28:49.461 --> 01:28:49.791
Parallel.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18346-0
01:28:49.801 --> 01:28:50.551
It just speaks parallel.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18357-0
01:28:50.561 --> 01:28:53.041
It just meaning it is and edge.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18364-0
01:28:53.051 --> 01:28:56.301
There are multiple edges between
two nodes, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18379-0
01:28:56.551 --> 01:29:00.535
So if you see here, it's a very
simple example that is this node

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18379-1
01:29:00.535 --> 01:29:00.841
oops.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18401-0
01:29:02.931 --> 01:29:06.270
That is this node and there is
this node between them there are

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18401-1
01:29:06.270 --> 01:29:06.791
two edges.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18406-0
01:29:06.801 --> 01:29:07.521
There is this one.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18426-0
01:29:07.581 --> 01:29:11.041
There is this 2 right both of
you are taking you to the same

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18426-1
01:29:11.041 --> 01:29:12.401
source and destinations.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18434-0
01:29:12.711 --> 01:29:16.541
So there is multiple edge or
parallel edges, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18446-0
01:29:16.551 --> 01:29:17.831
That is what is called parallel
edge.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18460-0
01:29:18.361 --> 01:29:21.644
Since there is no direction in
the edge in graph, there is loop

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18460-1
01:29:21.644 --> 01:29:21.951
right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18464-0
01:29:21.961 --> 01:29:22.421
So where is that?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18477-0
01:29:24.921 --> 01:29:27.791
Loop means usually we refer to
this as a loop, guys.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18479-0
01:29:27.861 --> 01:29:27.981
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18506-0
01:29:29.351 --> 01:29:33.033
And this is called a loop,
whereas here this is called as a

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18506-1
01:29:33.033 --> 01:29:33.401
cycle.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18513-0
01:29:34.461 --> 01:29:35.501
So I can start from here.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18520-0
01:29:36.361 --> 01:29:38.471
123 I can start from one.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18525-0
01:29:38.541 --> 01:29:39.291
I can go here.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18532-0
01:29:39.301 --> 01:29:40.291
I can go to three.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18536-0
01:29:40.301 --> 01:29:40.921
I can go back.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18557-0
01:29:41.021 --> 01:29:44.388
This is a cycle, so cycles can
be there in the simple graph,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18557-1
01:29:44.388 --> 01:29:46.981
loops cannot be there loop,
meaning self loop.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18567-0
01:29:50.731 --> 01:29:53.021
The two nodes are same for
parallel disk, correct?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18578-0
01:29:55.811 --> 01:29:57.541
What is adjacent over Artices,
Sir?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18587-0
01:29:57.551 --> 01:29:59.101
Yeah, we just learned about all
that.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18596-0
01:29:59.511 --> 01:30:00.671
Again, you are back to square
one.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18599-0
01:30:01.761 --> 01:30:03.051
Be very, very cautious.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18602-0
01:30:03.521 --> 01:30:03.661
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18608-0
01:30:05.161 --> 01:30:06.891
What is adjacent vertices?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18615-0
01:30:06.981 --> 01:30:09.411
Adjacent vertices are opposite
ones, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18627-0
01:30:09.421 --> 01:30:12.651
You and we are opposite or or
the two endpoints, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18643-0
01:30:12.661 --> 01:30:15.772
The two end vertices are always
adjacent, whereas you cannot say

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18643-1
01:30:15.772 --> 01:30:16.011
this.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18657-0
01:30:16.021 --> 01:30:19.498
U and Zed are adjacent or urnex
are adjacent or Y and we are

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18657-1
01:30:19.498 --> 01:30:20.011
adjacent.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18663-0
01:30:20.021 --> 01:30:20.761
You cannot tell like that.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18665-0
01:30:22.081 --> 01:30:22.671
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18678-0
01:30:23.041 --> 01:30:25.011
So we can start and end at the
same node.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18685-0
01:30:25.021 --> 01:30:26.351
For simple graph, yes you can do
that.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18694-0
01:30:26.901 --> 01:30:28.991
Yeah, that can be possible in a
simple graph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18702-0
01:30:32.761 --> 01:30:33.381
So far so good.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18704-0
01:30:33.391 --> 01:30:34.181
All of you, yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18707-0
01:30:36.241 --> 01:30:36.491
Yes.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18726-0
01:30:36.501 --> 01:30:40.700
No, maybe the definition so far
all these is it clear what is

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18726-1
01:30:40.700 --> 01:30:41.851
the simple graph?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18732-0
01:30:41.901 --> 01:30:42.551
What is the cycle?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18737-0
01:30:42.561 --> 01:30:43.201
What is the path?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18771-0
01:30:43.211 --> 01:30:47.165
What is the, you know loop self
loop, parallel edges directed

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18771-1
01:30:47.165 --> 01:30:51.246
undirected nodes, edges degrees
in directed graphs we will have

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18771-2
01:30:51.246 --> 01:30:54.561
parallel edges but the direction
will be different.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18781-0
01:30:54.871 --> 01:30:57.121
In that case, we will consider
them as having challenges.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18788-0
01:30:57.131 --> 01:30:58.501
No, we will not consider them.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18790-0
01:30:58.801 --> 01:30:59.161
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18794-0
01:30:59.171 --> 01:30:59.841
So if there is.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18816-0
01:31:02.421 --> 01:31:04.706
Yeah, but yeah, there are a lot
of examples we will look at it

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18816-1
01:31:04.706 --> 01:31:05.431
when the time comes.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18825-0
01:31:05.441 --> 01:31:08.341
But let's say if there is
A&amp;B, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18842-0
01:31:09.801 --> 01:31:13.961
So if there is from A to B,
there is one more from A to B.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18850-0
01:31:14.011 --> 01:31:14.921
This is a parallel edge.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18855-0
01:31:15.811 --> 01:31:17.951
Yeah, if you have something like
this.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18863-0
01:31:21.121 --> 01:31:22.331
This is not a parallel edge.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18891-0
01:31:23.491 --> 01:31:27.281
OK, this is from A to B and this
is from B to A and in many cases

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18891-1
01:31:27.281 --> 01:31:29.061
you will not draw it like this.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18894-0
01:31:29.371 --> 01:31:30.021
You will actually.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18902-0
01:31:31.981 --> 01:31:33.111
Right, like this, correct?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18964-0
01:31:33.121 --> 01:31:36.300
It simply means that you know
there is a path from A to

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18964-1
01:31:36.300 --> 01:31:39.535
B&amp;B to a, but if there are
different ways to it, for

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18964-2
01:31:39.535 --> 01:31:43.110
example if this is a tall route
and it costs you ₹100 if there

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18964-3
01:31:43.110 --> 01:31:46.743
is some you know by lanes and it
is continue ₹50, then it makes

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18964-4
01:31:46.743 --> 01:31:47.991
sense to mention this.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18974-0
01:31:48.841 --> 01:31:50.931
But these two are not the same
as what I mean.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/18984-0
01:31:51.361 --> 01:31:52.931
Yeah, this and these are
different.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19004-0
01:31:52.941 --> 01:31:56.218
This is say suppose using flight
and this is using train but this

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19004-1
01:31:56.218 --> 01:31:57.211
is from same A to B.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19007-0
01:31:58.091 --> 01:31:59.101
This is ballage.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19011-0
01:32:01.191 --> 01:32:01.421
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19018-0
01:32:01.431 --> 01:32:02.201
Is it clear all of you?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19026-0
01:32:03.741 --> 01:32:05.231
Yeah, because of the direction,
correct.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19047-0
01:32:07.031 --> 01:32:09.751
But we will be looking at a lot
of examples like this in this

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19047-1
01:32:09.751 --> 01:32:11.461
whole course, so don't worry
about it.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19053-0
01:32:11.531 --> 01:32:13.881
Yeah, a subgraph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19059-0
01:32:14.351 --> 01:32:15.311
Very interesting concept.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19080-0
01:32:16.491 --> 01:32:19.950
If you carve out something from
an existing graph, great, then

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19080-1
01:32:19.950 --> 01:32:21.541
that is called as a subgraph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19082-0
01:32:22.531 --> 01:32:23.221
A subgraph?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19122-0
01:32:23.231 --> 01:32:27.623
Yes, of a graph G is a graph
such that though workplaces of,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19122-1
01:32:27.623 --> 01:32:32.087
yes are a subset of the vertices
of G, the edges of yes are a

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19122-2
01:32:32.087 --> 01:32:34.391
subset of the edges of G subset.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19129-0
01:32:34.401 --> 01:32:36.161
All of you know normal Max
subset.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19132-0
01:32:37.171 --> 01:32:38.061
There is a graph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19149-0
01:32:38.071 --> 01:32:40.761
Vertices are 123456 and these
are the edges.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19158-0
01:32:40.771 --> 01:32:43.781
In this First things first, what
type of graph is this?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19160-0
01:32:46.971 --> 01:32:47.151
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19170-0
01:32:50.661 --> 01:32:52.271
Is it, uh, directed, undirected?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19180-0
01:32:54.871 --> 01:32:56.551
Yeah, this is a directed graph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19195-0
01:32:56.891 --> 01:33:00.118
Well directed simple graph
because there is no loops, there

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19195-1
01:33:00.118 --> 01:33:01.301
are no parallel edges.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19198-0
01:33:01.311 --> 01:33:02.501
Also great, cool.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19217-0
01:33:04.541 --> 01:33:10.483
And now if I carve out something
from here, something like this,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19217-1
01:33:10.483 --> 01:33:11.031
right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19240-0
01:33:12.821 --> 01:33:17.603
So in this case I have removed
that whole node 1/5 and whatever

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19240-1
01:33:17.603 --> 01:33:19.171
is remaining is here.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19248-0
01:33:19.281 --> 01:33:21.211
In this example I've removed
just that five.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19282-0
01:33:21.381 --> 01:33:24.535
I've removed some edges and so
one so there can be many

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19282-1
01:33:24.535 --> 01:33:27.970
subgraphs for a given graph G
and this is a homework for you

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19282-2
01:33:27.970 --> 01:33:29.941
to find out how many are
possible.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19291-0
01:33:30.841 --> 01:33:33.191
OK, these two are not
exhaustive.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19296-0
01:33:33.201 --> 01:33:34.251
There are many other dots.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19302-0
01:33:34.261 --> 01:33:35.191
Yeah, there are many possible.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19304-0
01:33:36.091 --> 01:33:36.461
OK.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19341-0
01:33:36.871 --> 01:33:40.859
But the simple fact is that if
we remove something from this

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19341-1
01:33:40.859 --> 01:33:44.780
week, if I remove something from
the edges, what I get as a

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19341-2
01:33:44.780 --> 01:33:47.721
result is a subgraph of this
original graph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19347-0
01:33:47.771 --> 01:33:48.181
This is all.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19354-0
01:33:48.191 --> 01:33:49.481
Yes, this is G and these are
all.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19360-0
01:33:49.491 --> 01:33:49.641
Yes.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19365-0
01:33:51.651 --> 01:33:52.201
Is this clear?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19381-0
01:33:52.211 --> 01:33:57.641
All of you, even if I remove one
edge that becomes a subgraph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19393-0
01:33:57.651 --> 01:34:00.631
If I remove one node that
becomes a subgraph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19397-0
01:34:02.041 --> 01:34:02.851
Is this clear? This.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19408-0
01:34:03.021 --> 01:34:04.551
Yeah, you can remove multiple in
this case.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19412-0
01:34:04.561 --> 01:34:05.331
I have removed this.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19417-0
01:34:05.341 --> 01:34:05.931
I removed this.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19426-0
01:34:05.941 --> 01:34:07.031
I removed this whole node.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19433-0
01:34:07.501 --> 01:34:08.381
Many things I have removed.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19441-0
01:34:09.161 --> 01:34:10.191
You can remove many of them.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19471-0
01:34:10.201 --> 01:34:16.008
Also, if there is a graph G and
if I remove all the edges only

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19471-1
01:34:16.008 --> 01:34:21.353
all the edges I have removed
then the resultants of graph

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19471-2
01:34:21.353 --> 01:34:21.721
yes.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19478-0
01:34:22.291 --> 01:34:23.291
What type will that be?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19480-0
01:34:25.061 --> 01:34:25.221
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19486-0
01:34:26.061 --> 01:34:27.191
Will it be a trivial graph?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19493-0
01:34:27.201 --> 01:34:28.411
Will it be a null graph?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19498-0
01:34:28.461 --> 01:34:29.191
Yeah, very good.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19504-0
01:34:29.241 --> 01:34:30.401
It will be a null graph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19514-0
01:34:30.901 --> 01:34:32.471
Will the null graph be a
subgraph?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19518-0
01:34:32.481 --> 01:34:33.271
Yes, exactly.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19541-0
01:34:33.441 --> 01:34:37.645
That is why in your mathematics,
when you do a subset, you also

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19541-1
01:34:37.645 --> 01:34:39.221
put this Mt as a subset.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19549-0
01:34:41.131 --> 01:34:42.441
Did did you get that?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19557-0
01:34:42.451 --> 01:34:43.281
Do you do that in math?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19580-0
01:34:44.181 --> 01:34:47.324
Whenever you take some subsets,
you do you know two power that

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19580-1
01:34:47.324 --> 01:34:48.571
many number and all that.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19590-0
01:34:48.581 --> 01:34:50.461
You put a you know empty set
right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19610-0
01:34:51.291 --> 01:34:56.184
That is also the same reason
here, where a null graph is a

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19610-1
01:34:56.184 --> 01:34:58.671
subset of these cool subgraph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19615-0
01:34:58.681 --> 01:34:59.311
All of you understood.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19628-0
01:35:00.081 --> 01:35:02.971
I can remove either age or a
vertex or both.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19654-0
01:35:03.041 --> 01:35:05.531
Any number of things I can
remove, but if I remove

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19654-1
01:35:05.531 --> 01:35:08.361
something what I get as a result
is called as a subgraph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19656-0
01:35:08.841 --> 01:35:09.451
Perfect.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19667-0
01:35:09.541 --> 01:35:11.111
Now, what is a spanning
subgraph?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19712-0
01:35:12.441 --> 01:35:17.212
A spanning subgraph of G is a
subgraph that contains all the

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19712-1
01:35:17.212 --> 01:35:21.278
vertices of G, meaning if I
always maintain all the

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19712-2
01:35:21.278 --> 01:35:26.126
vertices, VI only remove some
edges, then that is called as a

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19712-3
01:35:26.126 --> 01:35:28.081
spanning subgraph, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19741-0
01:35:29.361 --> 01:35:34.752
This is an example meaning in
other words I can say that in G

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19741-1
01:35:34.752 --> 01:35:39.621
the number of vertices right
this guy will be equal to.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19752-0
01:35:41.741 --> 01:35:43.901
It will be equal to the number
of. Oops.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19766-0
01:35:48.441 --> 01:35:51.601
Will be equal to the spanning
subgraph, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19781-0
01:35:52.841 --> 01:35:55.411
Its number of vertices, so here
it is 6 right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19785-0
01:35:55.871 --> 01:35:57.191
There are 123456 here.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19797-0
01:35:57.201 --> 01:35:58.651
Also there is 123456.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19812-0
01:35:58.871 --> 01:36:02.536
Only this particular edge, this
one as well as this one I have

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19812-1
01:36:02.536 --> 01:36:03.001
removed.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19834-0
01:36:04.491 --> 01:36:07.656
Then it becomes a spanning
subgraph and I'll graph will

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19834-1
01:36:07.656 --> 01:36:10.821
with all the vertices will also
be a spanning subgraph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19836-0
01:36:10.831 --> 01:36:10.931
No.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19841-0
01:36:11.691 --> 01:36:12.631
Yeah, all the vertices?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19852-0
01:36:12.641 --> 01:36:15.811
Yes, that will also be a
subgraph, correct?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19868-0
01:36:18.631 --> 01:36:21.328
His total number of subgraphs
possible for a given graph

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19868-1
01:36:21.328 --> 01:36:21.801
factorial.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19878-0
01:36:21.811 --> 01:36:22.621
No, that is up to you.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19886-0
01:36:22.631 --> 01:36:23.801
I told you that that's a
homework.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19893-0
01:36:23.811 --> 01:36:25.081
That's not a very simple answer.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19908-0
01:36:25.091 --> 01:36:28.091
It's not factorial, it is not
too power, etcetera.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19920-0
01:36:28.101 --> 01:36:30.891
It's a complex thing, but try to
find out about it.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19935-0
01:36:30.901 --> 01:36:33.831
Yeah, there is a lot of
interesting angle up to it.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19958-0
01:36:34.281 --> 01:36:38.209
If a graph has only one edge
between any two given vertices,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19958-1
01:36:38.209 --> 01:36:42.201
then it can't have a spanning
subgraph except the null graph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19967-0
01:36:42.581 --> 01:36:43.471
So what do you mean by that?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19979-0
01:36:44.701 --> 01:36:49.461
The graph has one edge between
any two given vertices.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19991-0
01:36:49.471 --> 01:36:52.441
OK, then it can't have a
spanning subgraph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/19995-0
01:36:52.451 --> 01:36:53.221
Why it can't have?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20015-0
01:36:55.751 --> 01:36:58.470
Yeah, I can remove all of them
and then it will become an L

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20015-1
01:36:58.470 --> 01:36:58.741
graph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20025-0
01:36:58.751 --> 01:37:00.411
But null graph is also a
spanning graph, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20032-0
01:37:01.611 --> 01:37:02.721
Yeah, you're right, Rajesh.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20041-0
01:37:02.731 --> 01:37:06.001
Correct, but are these
definitions clear for everyone?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20051-0
01:37:06.051 --> 01:37:09.271
Yeah, Amit, I don't see any
responses from you.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20053-0
01:37:09.281 --> 01:37:09.631
Are you there?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20059-0
01:37:13.721 --> 01:37:13.901
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20061-0
01:37:14.851 --> 01:37:16.091
Rishi bhadas, yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20067-0
01:37:17.961 --> 01:37:18.991
It's very, very simple.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20077-0
01:37:19.001 --> 01:37:21.001
Yeah, there is no point in
getting confused here.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20086-0
01:37:21.781 --> 01:37:24.471
Yeah, there is a graph given to
you.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20093-0
01:37:25.321 --> 01:37:26.731
You remove something from it.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20102-0
01:37:27.041 --> 01:37:27.801
It is a subgraph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20105-0
01:37:28.721 --> 01:37:29.401
So far so good.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20116-0
01:37:30.861 --> 01:37:32.911
Yeah, one vertex can also be a
subgraph, yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20121-0
01:37:35.021 --> 01:37:35.291
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20126-0
01:37:35.301 --> 01:37:36.401
We will go one by one.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20134-0
01:37:37.601 --> 01:37:38.831
I have a graph like this.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20146-0
01:37:39.361 --> 01:37:42.251
I really say this one vertex,
along with its edge.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20148-0
01:37:42.421 --> 01:37:42.751
Right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20162-0
01:37:42.981 --> 01:37:47.101
Whatever I get as a result is
nothing but my subgraph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20189-0
01:37:48.151 --> 01:37:51.454
So basically subgraph means I
can remove some vertices or I

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20189-1
01:37:51.454 --> 01:37:54.921
can remove some edges or I can
remove both edges and vertices.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20206-0
01:37:54.931 --> 01:37:59.191
However, I like correct what I
get as a result is a subgraph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20213-0
01:37:59.201 --> 01:38:00.041
You can have many of them.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20239-0
01:38:01.371 --> 01:38:06.169
Well, now what is a spanning
subgraph spanning subgraph means

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20239-1
01:38:06.169 --> 01:38:09.341
all the vertices in this that is
123456.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20249-0
01:38:09.581 --> 01:38:10.911
It should be definitely there.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20256-0
01:38:11.751 --> 01:38:13.081
Only some edges alone.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20268-0
01:38:13.091 --> 01:38:16.001
You then that is called as a
spanning subgraph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20274-0
01:38:17.451 --> 01:38:17.891
Is that clear?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20289-0
01:38:19.771 --> 01:38:22.618
In this example I have removed
this three to four and four to

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20289-1
01:38:22.618 --> 01:38:22.801
one.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20302-0
01:38:22.811 --> 01:38:25.599
I have removed or I could have
just removed, you know, some

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20302-1
01:38:25.599 --> 01:38:26.621
other adjacent so one.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20311-0
01:38:28.901 --> 01:38:30.151
Yeah, so far, so good.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20315-0
01:38:30.161 --> 01:38:30.481
All of you.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20336-0
01:38:30.491 --> 01:38:33.187
There are many interpretations
possible, but I'll leave it to

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20336-1
01:38:33.187 --> 01:38:35.491
you to do that, but for now I
will make a statement.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20349-0
01:38:37.721 --> 01:38:41.451
All spanning subgraphs are
subgraphs of G.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20351-0
01:38:42.201 --> 01:38:42.771
Is that correct?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20361-0
01:38:44.761 --> 01:38:49.121
All spanning subgraphs are
subgraphs of G.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20371-0
01:38:50.721 --> 01:38:53.721
All subgraphs are spanning
subgraphs.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20374-0
01:38:54.041 --> 01:38:54.561
Is that correct?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20383-0
01:38:57.251 --> 01:39:00.221
All subgraphs are spanning
subgraphs.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20386-0
01:39:00.231 --> 01:39:00.711
Is that correct?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20389-0
01:39:05.171 --> 01:39:05.401
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20397-0
01:39:05.411 --> 01:39:06.291
How many of you agree to that?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20413-0
01:39:07.201 --> 01:39:11.012
So correct, because in subgraph
I can remove a whole node

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20413-1
01:39:11.012 --> 01:39:11.471
itself.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20420-0
01:39:11.481 --> 01:39:13.051
I can remove 2-3 nodes itself.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20431-0
01:39:13.061 --> 01:39:16.034
That's possible, but then that
cannot be a spanning subgraph,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20431-1
01:39:16.034 --> 01:39:16.321
right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20450-0
01:39:17.871 --> 01:39:22.691
So all spanning subgraphs are
subgraphs, whereas all subgraphs

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20450-1
01:39:22.691 --> 01:39:25.291
are not spanning subgraphs.
Cool.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20453-0
01:39:28.391 --> 01:39:28.901
Connectivity.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20456-0
01:39:29.991 --> 01:39:31.451
Yeah, real quick.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20461-0
01:39:33.261 --> 01:39:33.741
Not always.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20463-0
01:39:33.751 --> 01:39:34.151
Yeah. Correct.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20470-0
01:39:35.921 --> 01:39:37.141
All subgraph cannot be spinning.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20473-0
01:39:37.151 --> 01:39:37.471
Cool. Cool.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20487-0
01:39:37.481 --> 01:39:40.351
Yeah, I still keep, you know,
I'm getting the same responses.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20494-0
01:39:40.361 --> 01:39:42.131
Yeah, thing you can stop now.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20496-0
01:39:42.141 --> 01:39:42.591
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20500-0
01:39:42.721 --> 01:39:43.231
Connectivity.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20513-0
01:39:44.571 --> 01:39:48.143
A graph is connected if there is
a path between every pair of

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20513-1
01:39:48.143 --> 01:39:48.661
vertices.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20529-0
01:39:49.151 --> 01:39:53.399
Yeah, from every vertex to other
vertex there should be some path

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20529-1
01:39:53.399 --> 01:39:54.171
to traverse.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20548-0
01:39:56.611 --> 01:40:00.460
So in this particular graph, if
I'm in any node, can I go to any

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20548-1
01:40:00.460 --> 01:40:01.111
other node?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20551-0
01:40:05.361 --> 01:40:05.671
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20554-0
01:40:05.681 --> 01:40:06.321
Perfect timing.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20556-0
01:40:06.331 --> 01:40:06.591
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20558-0
01:40:06.631 --> 01:40:06.971
Cool.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20561-0
01:40:07.061 --> 01:40:07.941
What about connectivity?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20598-0
01:40:09.931 --> 01:40:13.204
If I'm in any node I'm in here
in this node, I can go to this,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20598-1
01:40:13.204 --> 01:40:16.321
I can go to this and then here
or from there, here or here.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20634-0
01:40:16.431 --> 01:40:19.835
I can go to any other node
similarly if you are in any

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20634-1
01:40:19.835 --> 01:40:23.609
node, I can go to any other node
I can traverse then that is

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20634-2
01:40:23.609 --> 01:40:25.341
called as a connected graph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20645-0
01:40:26.351 --> 01:40:28.921
Yeah, this is called
connectivity of a graph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20662-0
01:40:28.931 --> 01:40:32.216
The graph with multiple
disconnected vertices and edges

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20662-1
01:40:32.216 --> 01:40:33.741
is set to be disconnected.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20674-0
01:40:34.251 --> 01:40:37.721
So for example, if you see here,
this is not connected right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20693-0
01:40:37.811 --> 01:40:40.461
If I'm in this node, I can go to
this or I can go to this.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20705-0
01:40:40.991 --> 01:40:43.121
I will not be able to go to
these parts.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20726-0
01:40:43.481 --> 01:40:46.201
Similarly, if I'm in this mode,
I can go here, but I cannot

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20726-1
01:40:46.201 --> 01:40:46.971
reach the others.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20742-0
01:40:47.371 --> 01:40:51.804
So this is called a disconnected
graph, but I have a small

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20742-1
01:40:51.804 --> 01:40:53.081
question for you.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20749-0
01:40:57.001 --> 01:40:57.741
Is this one?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20783-0
01:40:57.751 --> 01:41:02.190
This is say second, this is say
you know the first one and the

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20783-1
01:41:02.190 --> 01:41:06.700
below one is the second one is
the 2nd 1A subgraph of the first

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20783-2
01:41:06.700 --> 01:41:06.981
one.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20786-0
01:41:09.431 --> 01:41:09.701
Yes.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20791-0
01:41:09.711 --> 01:41:09.791
No.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20802-0
01:41:11.381 --> 01:41:14.471
Is the 2nd 1A subgraph of the
first one?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20813-0
01:41:14.481 --> 01:41:16.791
Yes, it's the second one.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20821-0
01:41:16.801 --> 01:41:20.071
A spanning subgraph of the first
one here.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20828-0
01:41:20.081 --> 01:41:20.991
Also, there are five nodes.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20830-0
01:41:22.391 --> 01:41:22.621
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20849-0
01:41:22.631 --> 01:41:27.250
Also, there are five notes, so
this is a spanning subgraph of

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20849-1
01:41:27.250 --> 01:41:28.441
the first graph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20859-0
01:41:29.841 --> 01:41:31.451
Correct, but it is this
connected.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20871-0
01:41:31.461 --> 01:41:33.051
I can go from here to here,
here, to here.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20880-0
01:41:33.061 --> 01:41:36.611
But I cannot reach here, so it
is disconnected.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20892-0
01:41:39.281 --> 01:41:40.611
Is this concept clear for all of
you?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20894-0
01:41:41.971 --> 01:41:42.691
Yeah. Connectivity.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20901-0
01:41:46.371 --> 01:41:48.511
Yes, no, cool.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20905-0
01:41:48.921 --> 01:41:50.231
There are two related concepts.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20912-0
01:41:50.241 --> 01:41:51.351
One is called a cut vertex.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20920-0
01:41:52.751 --> 01:41:54.971
Let G be a connected graph,
right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20927-0
01:41:54.981 --> 01:41:56.071
This is a connected graph,
right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20937-0
01:41:56.081 --> 01:41:57.141
So is this a connected graph?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20942-0
01:41:57.151 --> 01:41:57.551
All of you.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20946-0
01:41:57.591 --> 01:41:58.011
Do you agree?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20980-0
01:41:58.961 --> 01:42:02.290
I mean any note I can go to any
other node correct if I'm in BI

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20980-1
01:42:02.290 --> 01:42:05.411
can go to FI can go to G where
where I want I can go right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/20982-0
01:42:05.851 --> 01:42:06.111
Cool.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21010-0
01:42:06.801 --> 01:42:11.794
Now vertex we belongs to G is
called a cut vertex of G if G -,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21010-1
01:42:11.794 --> 01:42:14.091
V meaning he's a special guy.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21023-0
01:42:14.101 --> 01:42:17.981
OK, if you remove him from this
whole graph it will.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21034-0
01:42:18.161 --> 01:42:20.711
It will result the whole graph
in a disconnected graph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21048-0
01:42:21.961 --> 01:42:25.565
Removing a cut vertex from a
graph breaks it into two or more

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21048-1
01:42:25.565 --> 01:42:25.971
graphs.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21058-0
01:42:26.541 --> 01:42:27.551
Great theming.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21067-0
01:42:27.561 --> 01:42:29.571
Correct attacks will render a
graph disconnected.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21077-0
01:42:29.881 --> 01:42:33.251
So in this case, if I remove G,
what will happen?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21098-0
01:42:34.091 --> 01:42:36.839
Do you will get removed along
with these two, but still

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21098-1
01:42:36.839 --> 01:42:39.341
they're remaining graph will be
connected correct?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21109-0
01:42:39.491 --> 01:42:41.091
I can go from F2E from here.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21116-0
01:42:41.101 --> 01:42:42.301
I can go to CBA.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21119-0
01:42:42.311 --> 01:42:42.701
All of them.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21125-0
01:42:42.711 --> 01:42:44.851
I can go and so on, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21137-0
01:42:47.781 --> 01:42:51.071
So who is the cut vertex in
this?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21148-0
01:42:51.381 --> 01:42:53.361
Can someone name who's the cut
vertex in this?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21169-0
01:42:55.301 --> 01:42:58.869
So you can imagine these to be
important people in your friend

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21169-1
01:42:58.869 --> 01:43:00.171
circle or so on, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21181-0
01:43:00.311 --> 01:43:02.911
If they are not there, then you
will be disconnected, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21207-0
01:43:03.421 --> 01:43:06.724
Say there are groups of people
and there is one, you know,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21207-1
01:43:06.724 --> 01:43:09.131
important person who's holding
all of you.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21217-0
01:43:09.241 --> 01:43:12.631
If that is not there, then it'll
get disconnected.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21247-0
01:43:12.891 --> 01:43:17.150
Very good CNR examples by
removing E or C the graph will

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21247-1
01:43:17.150 --> 01:43:21.334
become disconnected right
unconnected, unconnected, and

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21247-2
01:43:21.334 --> 01:43:24.621
two different graphs are same or
different.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21256-0
01:43:24.811 --> 01:43:25.741
Yeah, they're different, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21268-0
01:43:26.631 --> 01:43:29.651
In this case, if you see they
are now disconnected.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21294-0
01:43:29.961 --> 01:43:33.090
So in this example I have
removed EI could have done C

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21294-1
01:43:33.090 --> 01:43:36.331
also, then the graph would have
been the opposite right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21309-0
01:43:36.501 --> 01:43:38.751
In this case it will be like
this and here it will be full.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21312-0
01:43:39.221 --> 01:43:39.771
Something like that.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21318-0
01:43:41.331 --> 01:43:42.691
So see RE.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21328-0
01:43:43.001 --> 01:43:47.361
Yeah, both of them can act as
cut vertex.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21349-0
01:43:47.401 --> 01:43:51.413
See can be also there or he can
also be there if E2F is a

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21349-1
01:43:51.413 --> 01:43:52.381
directed edge.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21355-0
01:43:52.391 --> 01:43:54.101
Yeah, directed is different
story.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21374-0
01:43:54.111 --> 01:43:57.389
Yeah, we are now talking about
undirected ones, but even

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21374-1
01:43:57.389 --> 01:43:59.171
indirectly it is the same case.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21387-0
01:43:59.611 --> 01:44:02.261
Yeah, you'll have to just try to
remove that node.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21399-0
01:44:02.651 --> 01:44:04.991
Will collapse the whole
connectivity.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21412-0
01:44:05.901 --> 01:44:08.971
Yeah, but in connect directed
graph it's more tricky.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21430-0
01:44:08.981 --> 01:44:13.076
We'll have to carefully observe
and, you know, decide that who's

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21430-1
01:44:13.076 --> 01:44:14.021
a cut edge now?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21445-0
01:44:15.081 --> 01:44:18.784
Yeah, most of you were actually
unknowingly answering the cut

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21445-1
01:44:18.784 --> 01:44:19.381
edge part.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21455-0
01:44:20.321 --> 01:44:23.471
Right cottage is nothing but
that C comma E right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21463-0
01:44:23.481 --> 01:44:24.311
This is the edge.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21478-0
01:44:24.541 --> 01:44:27.971
So in this case, if you see I
have removed only that edge.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21488-0
01:44:27.981 --> 01:44:31.081
I have not removed any node but
still this became disconnected.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21495-0
01:44:32.141 --> 01:44:33.761
So what is the conclusion?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21503-0
01:44:34.791 --> 01:44:37.561
Yeah, if I remove a cut edge.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21512-0
01:44:38.021 --> 01:44:39.351
What I will get is a.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21515-0
01:44:41.231 --> 01:44:41.761
What is it?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21524-0
01:44:41.931 --> 01:44:44.651
It is a spanning subgraph,
correct?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21560-0
01:44:44.661 --> 01:44:48.238
Because all the nodes are there
only edge I have removed but it

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21560-1
01:44:48.238 --> 01:44:51.423
left the whole graph to be
disconnected whereas in a cut

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21560-2
01:44:51.423 --> 01:44:53.881
vertex I'm actually removing a
node itself.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21580-0
01:44:54.251 --> 01:44:57.189
Then it cannot be a spanning
subgraph, so it's a normal

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21580-1
01:44:57.189 --> 01:44:59.391
subgraph and it will become
disconnected.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21582-0
01:45:00.801 --> 01:45:01.031
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21598-0
01:45:01.041 --> 01:45:02.561
Are these two concepts clear for
all of you?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21606-0
01:45:03.331 --> 01:45:05.831
In this example, there is only
one cut edge, yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21610-0
01:45:11.251 --> 01:45:11.701
Yes, no.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21612-0
01:45:11.711 --> 01:45:11.841
Cool.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21622-0
01:45:12.891 --> 01:45:14.671
Which part you want me to
repeat? Jagdish.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21624-0
01:45:14.681 --> 01:45:14.811
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21626-0
01:45:15.771 --> 01:45:16.031
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21638-0
01:45:16.041 --> 01:45:18.141
Again, you are going back to the
same graph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21640-0
01:45:18.151 --> 01:45:18.901
Subgraph story.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21644-0
01:45:18.911 --> 01:45:19.461
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21646-0
01:45:19.531 --> 01:45:20.661
Please listen carefully.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21650-0
01:45:20.671 --> 01:45:21.001
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21658-0
01:45:21.011 --> 01:45:23.281
Otherwise we will just end up
wasting time.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21674-0
01:45:23.291 --> 01:45:26.453
Yeah, we will not be able to
learn a lot of interesting

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21674-1
01:45:26.453 --> 01:45:26.961
concepts.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21679-0
01:45:27.371 --> 01:45:28.641
There is a graph here.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21690-0
01:45:28.971 --> 01:45:33.231
You remove Lords or edges or
both.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21698-0
01:45:34.571 --> 01:45:35.791
Then that is a subgraph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21712-0
01:45:36.801 --> 01:45:39.341
If I remove this file, what
remains is a subgraph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21714-0
01:45:39.801 --> 01:45:40.391
I remove two.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21725-0
01:45:40.601 --> 01:45:41.981
What remains a subgraph and so
on.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21751-0
01:45:42.711 --> 01:45:47.393
But if I have to keep all these
nodes intact, all that 123456

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21751-1
01:45:47.393 --> 01:45:48.601
should be there.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21767-0
01:45:48.751 --> 01:45:52.352
I can remove only these edges,
then that is a spanning

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21767-1
01:45:52.352 --> 01:45:52.941
subgraph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21769-0
01:45:53.871 --> 01:45:54.291
Is that clear?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21772-0
01:45:58.261 --> 01:45:58.711
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21785-0
01:45:58.761 --> 01:46:01.411
Well, there's some other
question from Manish.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21798-0
01:46:01.421 --> 01:46:05.215
If it is connected from B as
well and remove C, will it be

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21798-1
01:46:05.215 --> 01:46:06.051
disconnected?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21800-0
01:46:06.141 --> 01:46:06.371
No.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21809-0
01:46:06.381 --> 01:46:07.661
Then it will not be
disconnected, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21831-0
01:46:10.891 --> 01:46:13.542
It should completely become
disconnected, meaning from here

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21831-1
01:46:13.542 --> 01:46:14.911
I cannot go to that part right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21850-0
01:46:15.621 --> 01:46:18.930
So if it is having another
connectivity here right then it

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21850-1
01:46:18.930 --> 01:46:20.331
will not be disconnected.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21863-0
01:46:20.821 --> 01:46:23.081
So in that case, how many cut
edges will be here?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21878-0
01:46:24.961 --> 01:46:27.961
See comma E will be a cottage B
comma.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21885-0
01:46:27.971 --> 01:46:29.611
F will also become another
cottage.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21887-0
01:46:30.611 --> 01:46:32.361
Correct. Cool.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21892-0
01:46:34.131 --> 01:46:35.121
Reinforce.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21898-0
01:46:35.191 --> 01:46:37.441
Yeah, a free tree.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21902-0
01:46:37.451 --> 01:46:38.531
Very, very important.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21909-0
01:46:38.581 --> 01:46:39.811
Please don't get confused.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21921-0
01:46:39.861 --> 01:46:44.617
A free tree is an undirected
graph T such that T is

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21921-1
01:46:44.617 --> 01:46:45.531
connected.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21927-0
01:46:45.801 --> 01:46:46.731
T has no cycles.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21931-0
01:46:48.141 --> 01:46:48.281
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21961-0
01:46:49.601 --> 01:46:53.055
For example like this it is
connected, meaning from any node

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21961-1
01:46:53.055 --> 01:46:56.566
I can go to any other node and
there are no cycles also leave

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21961-2
01:46:56.566 --> 01:46:57.471
alone the loops.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21965-0
01:46:57.541 --> 01:46:58.291
There is no cycle.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/21973-0
01:46:58.301 --> 01:46:59.961
Also, there is no cycle.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22004-0
01:46:59.971 --> 01:47:04.050
There is no loop and it is
connected, meaning from any node

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22004-1
01:47:04.050 --> 01:47:08.401
I can go to any other node then
I can call this as a free tree.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22018-0
01:47:09.761 --> 01:47:12.495
This definition of tree is
different from the one of a

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22018-1
01:47:12.495 --> 01:47:13.091
rooted tree.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22029-0
01:47:13.521 --> 01:47:15.691
What we were learning in the
previous classes, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22031-0
01:47:15.781 --> 01:47:16.231
Trees.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22038-0
01:47:16.241 --> 01:47:18.511
Heaps that is not this one.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22045-0
01:47:18.881 --> 01:47:20.521
This is called a free tree.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22047-0
01:47:22.321 --> 01:47:22.651
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22069-0
01:47:22.661 --> 01:47:25.654
And the what we had learned
earlier is called a rooted tree,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22069-1
01:47:25.654 --> 01:47:26.831
really like this, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22078-0
01:47:28.111 --> 01:47:30.381
Put is this clear for all of
you?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22080-0
01:47:34.411 --> 01:47:34.611
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22089-0
01:47:36.841 --> 01:47:37.861
What is a free tree?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22114-0
01:47:38.901 --> 01:47:41.839
So then both of them should not
be cut edges because removing

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22114-1
01:47:41.839 --> 01:47:44.491
one of them will not make the
graph disconnect correct.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22135-0
01:47:44.501 --> 01:47:48.074
You have to remove both of them
only when you remove both of

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22135-1
01:47:48.074 --> 01:47:50.651
them then it will become
disconnected yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22152-0
01:47:55.091 --> 01:47:57.661
No spanning subgraph is not the
same as tree, and so on.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22160-0
01:47:57.671 --> 01:47:59.261
Yeah, this is a completely
different concept.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22183-0
01:47:59.491 --> 01:48:04.531
Free Tree is nothing but a graph
in which it is connected as well

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22183-1
01:48:04.531 --> 01:48:06.211
as there is no cycles.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22185-0
01:48:08.511 --> 01:48:08.671
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22193-0
01:48:11.211 --> 01:48:12.521
What do you mean by orientation?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22204-0
01:48:14.611 --> 01:48:15.981
These two are different concepts
guys.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22208-0
01:48:15.991 --> 01:48:16.981
This is a rooted tree.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22253-0
01:48:17.091 --> 01:48:20.569
It follows all those concepts
that we learned previously,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22253-1
01:48:20.569 --> 01:48:24.466
whereas this is a graph, this is
this is a graph, but we give it

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22253-2
01:48:24.466 --> 01:48:28.363
a special name called as a free
tree because it is connected and

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22253-3
01:48:28.363 --> 01:48:29.981
it doesn't have cycles. OK.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22261-0
01:48:32.311 --> 01:48:33.431
So far so good, all of you.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22277-0
01:48:40.691 --> 01:48:43.971
So in that terms I have one
final question for you.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22280-0
01:48:45.301 --> 01:48:47.451
Are all trees graphs?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22298-0
01:48:49.581 --> 01:48:54.513
Yeah, it's not to confuse you,
but just for fun, are all trees

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22298-1
01:48:54.513 --> 01:48:55.061
graphs.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22309-0
01:48:56.901 --> 01:48:59.351
Yeah, because the tree will
never have a cycle.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22327-0
01:48:59.841 --> 01:49:05.880
A tree will always be connected,
so all trees are grass, but all

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22327-1
01:49:05.880 --> 01:49:07.831
graphs are not trees.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22331-0
01:49:09.561 --> 01:49:09.701
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22339-0
01:49:11.251 --> 01:49:11.661
Cool.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22360-0
01:49:11.671 --> 01:49:15.998
I leave these discussions here
for us is nothing but again

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22360-1
01:49:15.998 --> 01:49:18.271
multiple, you know, free trees.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22384-0
01:49:18.471 --> 01:49:21.465
If you have a tree like this, if
you have another tree like this

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22384-1
01:49:21.465 --> 01:49:23.721
and so on, all of them put
together is a forest.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22389-0
01:49:26.651 --> 01:49:26.871
Cool.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22394-0
01:49:26.881 --> 01:49:27.461
So far so good.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22396-0
01:49:27.471 --> 01:49:27.811
All of you?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22399-0
01:49:28.971 --> 01:49:29.091
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22406-0
01:49:30.361 --> 01:49:31.231
Graphs so far.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22418-0
01:49:31.241 --> 01:49:33.476
Is it clear rooted is
hierarchical and free trees

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22418-1
01:49:33.476 --> 01:49:34.191
network perfect?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22423-0
01:49:34.661 --> 01:49:35.691
That's very good, Sir Andrew.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22447-0
01:49:35.701 --> 01:49:39.069
Yeah, these are hidden things
that I usually don't explicitly

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22447-1
01:49:39.069 --> 01:49:42.111
tell in the class because that's
for you to figure out.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22478-0
01:49:42.601 --> 01:49:45.288
Router tree is always
hierarchical, whereas the free

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22478-1
01:49:45.288 --> 01:49:48.430
trees actually a free trees, a
graph only correct because the

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22478-2
01:49:48.430 --> 01:49:50.001
definition says the free trees.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22492-0
01:49:50.011 --> 01:49:55.110
An undirected graph T, so by
this word itself it becomes

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22492-1
01:49:55.110 --> 01:49:56.451
network, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22496-0
01:49:56.461 --> 01:49:57.261
It is not hierarchical.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22500-0
01:49:59.931 --> 01:50:00.541
OK, cool.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22516-0
01:50:00.711 --> 01:50:03.248
What are the different
operations that I can do on a

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22516-1
01:50:03.248 --> 01:50:04.061
stack real quick?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22531-0
01:50:06.651 --> 01:50:08.471
The moment I talk about stack,
what can I do?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22546-0
01:50:09.301 --> 01:50:11.401
I can do push, I can do pop, I
can do top.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22560-0
01:50:12.601 --> 01:50:16.190
Similarly, if there is a queue,
I can do enqueue, I can do

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22560-1
01:50:16.190 --> 01:50:17.041
dequeue right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22579-0
01:50:17.361 --> 01:50:19.611
And if there is a heap I can do
insert, remove and so on.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22591-0
01:50:19.901 --> 01:50:22.761
But in a graph I can do a lot of
interesting things.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22596-0
01:50:24.571 --> 01:50:24.941
Right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22605-0
01:50:25.311 --> 01:50:27.241
Return the number of nodes,
return number of edges.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22615-0
01:50:27.251 --> 01:50:29.281
Return a set of vertices set of
edges.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22631-0
01:50:29.291 --> 01:50:33.033
The degree the You know list
containing all the edges

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22631-1
01:50:33.033 --> 01:50:35.111
incident upon our text, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22657-0
01:50:35.121 --> 01:50:38.604
I can do a lot of methods, for
example in this case I told you

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22657-1
01:50:38.604 --> 01:50:40.981
right if what type of a graph is
this one?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22664-0
01:50:42.911 --> 01:50:43.751
Is it directed or undirected?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22673-0
01:50:46.491 --> 01:50:48.671
Right is also small mistake
here.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22681-0
01:50:49.451 --> 01:50:50.931
Let's assume this is H.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22694-0
01:50:53.421 --> 01:50:55.151
Right, this is a directed edge.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22721-0
01:50:55.301 --> 01:51:00.580
So in this case there are some
other concepts like in degree in

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22721-1
01:51:00.580 --> 01:51:05.281
degree means how many edges are
coming towards me right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22730-0
01:51:05.291 --> 01:51:08.181
For example, for a this is the
indegree.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22737-0
01:51:08.191 --> 01:51:09.781
So how many indegree does it
have a?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22739-0
01:51:11.391 --> 01:51:11.551
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22765-0
01:51:14.551 --> 01:51:17.532
It has only one and how many out
degree does it have out degree

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22765-1
01:51:17.532 --> 01:51:19.161
means how many days are going
out.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22798-0
01:51:19.211 --> 01:51:22.800
So this one is going out,
whereas for see if you see the

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22798-1
01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:26.451
number of in degrees one, but
the number of out degrees 3

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22798-2
01:51:26.451 --> 01:51:27.961
right there is this one.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22817-0
01:51:27.971 --> 01:51:31.509
There is this two there is this
33 arrows are going out whereas

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22817-1
01:51:31.509 --> 01:51:32.891
one is coming towards it.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22843-0
01:51:33.601 --> 01:51:37.394
So for a directed graph there is
this concept of indegree and

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22843-1
01:51:37.394 --> 01:51:40.391
outdegree right, whereas here it
is just degree.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22864-0
01:51:40.401 --> 01:51:43.331
So for this it is 3 where it is
3 for all of it it is 3.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22877-0
01:51:45.001 --> 01:51:47.865
There are some interesting small
theorems on these in your

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22877-1
01:51:47.865 --> 01:51:48.301
textbook.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22889-0
01:51:48.391 --> 01:51:50.731
Maybe it's a good idea to have a
look at it, yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22921-0
01:51:53.071 --> 01:51:56.306
I can give an edge and ask the
two corresponding you know

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22921-1
01:51:56.306 --> 01:51:59.819
endpoints of it and all those
indicate whether a given edge is

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22921-2
01:51:59.819 --> 01:52:01.101
directed or not, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22944-0
01:52:01.111 --> 01:52:05.764
Give the in degree of it, insert
a new node right, insert a new

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22944-1
01:52:05.764 --> 01:52:06.781
directed edge.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22957-0
01:52:06.831 --> 01:52:09.461
So a lot of things you can do
remove something and so on.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22969-0
01:52:10.131 --> 01:52:13.611
So will you be able to write
Python code for these methods?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22984-0
01:52:15.361 --> 01:52:19.545
Yeah, removal, insertion, giving
the nodes, returning a list and

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22984-1
01:52:19.545 --> 01:52:19.931
so on.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22991-0
01:52:19.941 --> 01:52:20.631
Will you be able to do that?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/22994-0
01:52:22.711 --> 01:52:23.031
Yes. No.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23007-0
01:52:25.531 --> 01:52:27.611
If not, it's a good idea to
practice them.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23025-0
01:52:27.721 --> 01:52:30.893
Yeah, these are all small
operations that you can do on a

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23025-1
01:52:30.893 --> 01:52:31.221
graph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23044-0
01:52:31.301 --> 01:52:34.858
So try to practice them by
writing small snippets and now

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23044-1
01:52:34.858 --> 01:52:36.391
we come to the last part.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23051-0
01:52:38.051 --> 01:52:40.131
How do you represent a stack?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23054-0
01:52:43.251 --> 01:52:43.431
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23067-0
01:52:45.091 --> 01:52:47.381
How do you represent or
implement a stack?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23074-0
01:52:48.851 --> 01:52:49.871
There are two ways to do it.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23082-0
01:52:51.571 --> 01:52:52.481
Array or El.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23084-0
01:52:52.531 --> 01:52:52.971
Very good.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23090-0
01:52:52.981 --> 01:52:53.981
Yeah, Nandini is correct.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23098-0
01:52:54.851 --> 01:52:56.441
How do you represent a queue?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23109-0
01:52:56.711 --> 01:52:58.411
Same thing I can do array or
linked list.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23114-0
01:52:59.631 --> 01:53:01.781
How do you represent 3?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23121-0
01:53:04.051 --> 01:53:04.821
Again, same thing.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23136-0
01:53:04.831 --> 01:53:08.857
I can use an array or linked
list, but how do you represent a

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23136-1
01:53:08.857 --> 01:53:09.181
heap?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23140-0
01:53:11.301 --> 01:53:11.771
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23146-0
01:53:11.841 --> 01:53:12.601
What is your reasoning?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23174-0
01:53:13.941 --> 01:53:17.116
A heap is always a complete
binary tree and a complete

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23174-1
01:53:17.116 --> 01:53:20.175
binary tree can always be
implemented using a array,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23174-2
01:53:20.175 --> 01:53:20.521
right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23179-0
01:53:20.531 --> 01:53:21.091
You'll use an array.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23185-0
01:53:23.111 --> 01:53:24.021
Pranav says is.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23203-0
01:53:24.031 --> 01:53:26.744
It compulsory to understand in
Python Java will not work as

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23203-1
01:53:26.744 --> 01:53:27.241
assignment.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23209-0
01:53:27.251 --> 01:53:28.641
Also, Java was mentioned no.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23225-0
01:53:29.251 --> 01:53:32.669
All your assignments will be
only in Python And all your M

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23225-1
01:53:32.669 --> 01:53:34.001
tech will be in Python.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23276-0
01:53:34.251 --> 01:53:37.476
Yeah, you will not do Java
assignments for data analysis

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23276-1
01:53:37.476 --> 01:53:40.983
and all that throughout this M
tech you will use only Python,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23276-2
01:53:40.983 --> 01:53:44.546
but that's fine as I told, if
you have not mastered it slowly,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23276-3
01:53:44.546 --> 01:53:47.091
you can pick it up right in your
assignment.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23297-0
01:53:48.111 --> 01:53:51.028
There will be at least one
person in your group who knows

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23297-1
01:53:51.028 --> 01:53:53.491
Python, so work with them and
get it done right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23301-0
01:53:55.191 --> 01:53:55.561
Cool.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23304-0
01:53:55.571 --> 01:53:56.281
So far so good.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23338-0
01:53:56.471 --> 01:54:00.226
So you can use a complete binary
tree if it's a complete binary,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23338-1
01:54:00.226 --> 01:54:03.691
you will use an array so like
that for every data structure

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23338-2
01:54:03.691 --> 01:54:05.481
there is a way to implement it.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23364-0
01:54:05.931 --> 01:54:09.541
So for a graph, there are three
ways a graph representation

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23364-1
01:54:09.541 --> 01:54:13.331
strategy, or you can also call
it as how to implement a graph?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23386-0
01:54:13.621 --> 01:54:17.444
You can use a edge list or you
can use adjacency matrix or you

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23386-1
01:54:17.444 --> 01:54:18.961
can use a adjacency list.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23400-0
01:54:20.061 --> 01:54:23.681
Yeah, the adjacency list is not
a very popular way.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23407-0
01:54:23.691 --> 01:54:25.611
It is not much used, yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23420-0
01:54:28.301 --> 01:54:30.511
So for example, if this is a
graph, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23449-0
01:54:30.861 --> 01:54:37.188
This is an undirected graph with
nodes and vertices with four

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23449-1
01:54:37.188 --> 01:54:39.331
nodes and four edges.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23463-0
01:54:40.081 --> 01:54:43.791
So I if I want to represent it
in a edge list, this is the way

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23463-1
01:54:43.791 --> 01:54:44.321
to do it.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23488-0
01:54:44.381 --> 01:54:47.974
There will be a vertex object
which will have the element and

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23488-1
01:54:47.974 --> 01:54:50.871
the pointer to that vertex,
right pointer to UVW.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23541-0
01:54:50.881 --> 01:54:54.676
Is it this whole thing is also a
list or I can have an edge right

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23541-1
01:54:54.676 --> 01:54:58.241
which is pointing to the actual
edges and that itself is in a

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23541-2
01:54:58.241 --> 01:55:01.749
list and then again it will
point to the source destination,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23541-3
01:55:01.749 --> 01:55:03.761
its source, destination and so
on.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23560-0
01:55:05.411 --> 01:55:08.066
This whole vertex itself is a
sequence and this whole edge

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23560-1
01:55:08.066 --> 01:55:09.011
itself is a sequence.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23571-0
01:55:09.831 --> 01:55:11.301
But this is your textbook way of
doing.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23580-0
01:55:11.311 --> 01:55:13.501
But you know, I will tell you a
simpler way.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23589-0
01:55:13.991 --> 01:55:15.181
Let's assume this is a graph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23600-0
01:55:16.611 --> 01:55:19.071
So what is this called in
Python?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23609-0
01:55:19.941 --> 01:55:22.441
If you have a square bracket,
what is it called?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23627-0
01:55:25.871 --> 01:55:27.741
It's so no, it is not a set.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23629-0
01:55:27.751 --> 01:55:28.541
It is a list.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23635-0
01:55:29.131 --> 01:55:30.011
Yeah, actually has, right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23643-0
01:55:30.021 --> 01:55:31.821
So you have a list inside that.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23650-0
01:55:31.831 --> 01:55:33.341
What do you have you comma V?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23661-0
01:55:33.431 --> 01:55:34.291
What is yugami?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23671-0
01:55:36.141 --> 01:55:38.251
If I just denote you comma we
what can I call it?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23700-0
01:55:38.261 --> 01:55:43.004
I can call it as a edge, correct
you comma B is a edge we comma W

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23700-1
01:55:43.004 --> 01:55:45.231
is a edge W comma, U is a edge.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23719-0
01:55:45.641 --> 01:55:49.689
So this is nothing but a list of
edges, so it is called as an

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23719-1
01:55:49.689 --> 01:55:50.341
edge list.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23722-0
01:55:52.161 --> 01:55:52.381
Right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23748-0
01:55:53.131 --> 01:55:57.499
And if you see the next example
0112, so there is a list of

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23748-1
01:55:57.499 --> 01:55:58.881
edges given to you.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23761-0
01:55:58.971 --> 01:56:01.331
If this is given, will you be
able to recreate the graph?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23778-0
01:56:02.381 --> 01:56:05.148
That is it possible to have a
been our own pseudo code for

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23778-1
01:56:05.148 --> 01:56:05.851
tree and graph?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23783-0
01:56:05.921 --> 01:56:07.321
Yeah, let's check that.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23804-0
01:56:07.401 --> 01:56:10.465
But there are other concepts to
be covered, so you actually

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23804-1
01:56:10.465 --> 01:56:12.711
implement these in your actual
assignments.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23806-0
01:56:12.781 --> 01:56:12.931
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23808-0
01:56:14.551 --> 01:56:14.781
Cool.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23811-0
01:56:14.791 --> 01:56:15.191
That's fine.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23820-0
01:56:15.201 --> 01:56:16.321
Yeah, there's a couple of list.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23825-0
01:56:16.331 --> 01:56:16.861
That's fine.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23832-0
01:56:17.111 --> 01:56:19.131
Inside the tuple you have the
edges, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23849-0
01:56:19.431 --> 01:56:22.565
So will you be able to recreate
the graph if this line alone is

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23849-1
01:56:22.565 --> 01:56:23.201
given to you?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23852-0
01:56:25.531 --> 01:56:25.931
Yes. No.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23865-0
01:56:30.011 --> 01:56:32.471
You will have 012345 as nodes.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23878-0
01:56:32.481 --> 01:56:34.581
You will try to, you know, join
the edges and so on.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23880-0
01:56:35.111 --> 01:56:35.461
Right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23884-0
01:56:35.891 --> 01:56:36.181
Cool.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23891-0
01:56:36.411 --> 01:56:38.981
So this is not a widely used
technique.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23894-0
01:56:39.031 --> 01:56:39.641
OK.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23899-0
01:56:39.811 --> 01:56:41.341
But it is still existing, yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23905-0
01:56:43.311 --> 01:56:44.681
What about adjacency matrix?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23921-0
01:56:44.691 --> 01:56:47.031
We will have a look at this and
then we will close it for today.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23928-0
01:56:47.041 --> 01:56:47.741
Yeah, this is a.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23935-0
01:56:47.811 --> 01:56:49.781
This is a very, very important
concept.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23944-0
01:56:49.791 --> 01:56:51.361
How do you represent a graph?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23994-0
01:56:52.571 --> 01:56:57.062
And adjacency matrix A of a
graph G is formally defined as a

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23994-1
01:56:57.062 --> 01:57:01.626
of I comma J is equal to 1 if
there is an edge from vertex I2

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/23994-2
01:57:01.626 --> 01:57:06.411
vertex J, it is 0 if there is no
edge from vertex it to artex J.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24027-0
01:57:07.771 --> 01:57:11.730
It is clear from the definition
that an adjacency matrix of a

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24027-1
01:57:11.730 --> 01:57:15.305
graph with N vertices is a
boolean square matrix with N

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24027-2
01:57:15.305 --> 01:57:18.561
rows in north columns with
entries ones and zeros.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24035-0
01:57:18.611 --> 01:57:19.771
It is called a bit matrix.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24050-0
01:57:20.871 --> 01:57:23.906
Don't let the about definition
holds true for both directed and

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24050-1
01:57:23.906 --> 01:57:24.711
undirected graph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24071-0
01:57:25.071 --> 01:57:28.908
If it's an adjacency matrix of
an undirected graph, then the

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24071-1
01:57:28.908 --> 01:57:32.241
matrix will look symmetric and
diagonal being zeros.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24093-0
01:57:32.951 --> 01:57:36.001
Note if there are multiple edges
then then you can also put that

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24093-1
01:57:36.001 --> 01:57:37.831
number, but let's not read the
slides.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24099-0
01:57:37.841 --> 01:57:40.291
Let's do it real quick.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24110-0
01:57:40.301 --> 01:57:41.901
Tell me what type of a graph is
this?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24119-0
01:57:43.451 --> 01:57:44.861
Is it directed or is it
undirected?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24125-0
01:57:48.251 --> 01:57:49.301
Yeah, directed graph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24131-0
01:57:49.351 --> 01:57:50.521
How many nodes are here?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24141-0
01:57:51.511 --> 01:57:53.511
Amit will tell me that how many
nodes are there?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24159-0
01:57:58.591 --> 01:58:01.429
Since it's a graph, there can be
any number of edges, any number

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24159-1
01:58:01.429 --> 01:58:01.821
of nodes.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24170-0
01:58:01.831 --> 01:58:05.101
Also, there is no relation
between nodes and edges, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24183-0
01:58:05.391 --> 01:58:08.561
So here you have 4 nodes and
many edges.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24195-0
01:58:09.051 --> 01:58:12.421
If there are four nodes, then
what will be the matrix size?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24217-0
01:58:14.251 --> 01:58:20.890
We learned it as a square matrix
of size N cross N and here N is

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24217-1
01:58:20.890 --> 01:58:23.341
nothing but four, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24227-0
01:58:23.771 --> 01:58:25.561
So what will be the size of my
matrix?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24233-0
01:58:25.711 --> 01:58:26.831
It will be 4 cross 4.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24243-0
01:58:29.121 --> 01:58:30.141
I limit as ABCD.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24254-0
01:58:30.151 --> 01:58:32.751
I'll limit as ABCD from A to B.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24267-0
01:58:32.761 --> 01:58:35.371
There is a edge here, so from A
to B I'll put a one.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24300-0
01:58:35.861 --> 01:58:40.853
There are no self loops here, so
A to a, B to BC2CD2D0 from 8 to

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24300-1
01:58:40.853 --> 01:58:42.081
C there is edge.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24325-0
01:58:42.091 --> 01:58:46.276
So from A to C, I'll put a one
from A to D there is edge, so

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24325-1
01:58:46.276 --> 01:58:48.471
I'll put a one, but it's from B.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24341-0
01:58:48.481 --> 01:58:51.551
There is only B2C, so that alone
is a one other zeros.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24357-0
01:58:52.681 --> 01:58:56.151
Some see there is only C2D, so
C2D is a one.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24367-0
01:58:56.161 --> 01:58:57.961
Others are all zeros and so on.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24376-0
01:58:59.421 --> 01:59:00.601
Is this clear for all of you?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24380-0
01:59:02.401 --> 01:59:02.721
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24389-0
01:59:02.731 --> 01:59:05.841
How to represent a graph in
adjacency matrix?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24395-0
01:59:08.231 --> 01:59:09.021
What about this one?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24416-0
01:59:09.991 --> 01:59:14.361
This is an undirected graph,
again 4 nodes, so there will be

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24416-1
01:59:14.361 --> 01:59:15.721
again 4 cross four.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24436-0
01:59:17.021 --> 01:59:21.171
So from A to a B to BC2CD2D0
because there are no self loops.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24497-0
01:59:23.351 --> 01:59:28.730
A to B there is a edge, so A to
B there is a one because it is

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24497-1
01:59:28.730 --> 01:59:33.340
undirected B to A is also A1
right A to C there is an

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24497-2
01:59:33.340 --> 01:59:38.889
undirected edge, so A to CC to a
right AC there is A1 and C2A is

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24497-3
01:59:38.889 --> 01:59:40.511
also one like this.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24504-0
01:59:40.521 --> 01:59:41.451
You should be able to create.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24518-0
01:59:43.131 --> 01:59:47.271
Yes, Amit, I've just shown that
is this clear for all of you?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24522-0
01:59:51.361 --> 01:59:53.591
Yeah, exactly.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24555-0
01:59:53.601 --> 01:59:56.702
So if you look at this
undirected graphs matrix, it is

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24555-1
01:59:56.702 --> 02:00:00.140
symmetric actually right there
is this one one there is this

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24555-2
02:00:00.140 --> 02:00:02.451
one one corresponding here there
is one.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24570-0
02:00:02.601 --> 02:00:06.615
So if you fold it across this
diagonal primary diagonal, it

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24570-1
02:00:06.615 --> 02:00:08.421
will look symmetric, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24581-0
02:00:08.431 --> 02:00:11.181
That is a property for
undirected graph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24599-0
02:00:11.241 --> 02:00:14.116
If you look at this matrix, that
property will obey, whereas for

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24599-1
02:00:14.116 --> 02:00:15.221
this one it may not obey.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24606-0
02:00:16.561 --> 02:00:18.351
Cool how to represent multiple
edges?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24612-0
02:00:18.361 --> 02:00:19.131
Yeah, multiple edges.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24622-0
02:00:19.141 --> 02:00:21.051
You can count that and put it as
a number.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24634-0
02:00:21.141 --> 02:00:24.051
Something like this from V5 to
V2.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24647-0
02:00:24.321 --> 02:00:28.107
There are three parallel edges,
so you can put that number as a

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24647-1
02:00:28.107 --> 02:00:28.521
3 here.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24659-0
02:00:30.631 --> 02:00:32.251
Yeah, it will always be a square
matrix.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24663-0
02:00:32.261 --> 02:00:32.841
That's correct.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24671-0
02:00:33.311 --> 02:00:35.101
It will always be a square
matrix.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24697-0
02:00:35.331 --> 02:00:38.488
It will always be a Boolean
matrix, whereas if it has

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24697-1
02:00:38.488 --> 02:00:42.111
multiple edges like this, that
numbers will become like this.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24707-0
02:00:42.121 --> 02:00:44.131
Then it is not a Boolean matrix,
right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24714-0
02:00:45.301 --> 02:00:46.091
Yeah, some bit.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24721-0
02:00:46.601 --> 02:00:48.151
I think there's a lag from your
end.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24729-0
02:00:48.361 --> 02:00:50.161
This is the example of multiple.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24741-0
02:00:50.601 --> 02:00:52.531
There are three here, so I'll
put that three here.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24745-0
02:00:53.421 --> 02:00:53.751
Right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24756-0
02:00:53.761 --> 02:00:55.851
V2 to V5V5 to V2 are three.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24778-0
02:00:57.871 --> 02:01:00.785
Is this clear guys for all of
you, how do you represent a

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24778-1
02:01:00.785 --> 02:01:02.191
graph as a adjacency matrix?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24781-0
02:01:04.311 --> 02:01:04.601
Yes.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24783-0
02:01:04.611 --> 02:01:04.941
No, maybe.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24828-0
02:01:07.751 --> 02:01:11.360
Yeah, there are some pros and
cons which we will look at in

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24828-1
02:01:11.360 --> 02:01:15.270
the next class and then we will
look at that last representation

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24828-2
02:01:15.270 --> 02:01:18.759
of adjacency list right and then
we will also look at the

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24828-3
02:01:18.759 --> 02:01:19.841
traversals, right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24842-0
02:01:19.851 --> 02:01:21.941
If a graph like this is given,
how do you traverse it?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24864-0
02:01:22.371 --> 02:01:25.707
The you know, breadth first and
depth 1st way, but Sir, it was

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24864-1
02:01:25.707 --> 02:01:28.301
supposed to be only one or zero
exactly correct.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24904-0
02:01:28.431 --> 02:01:32.437
So usually if it is a normal
graph like this without parallel

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24904-1
02:01:32.437 --> 02:01:35.925
edges, it will be a boolean
matrix, whereas if it has

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24904-2
02:01:35.925 --> 02:01:39.671
parallel edges then you can have
that number itself here.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24927-0
02:01:40.121 --> 02:01:43.587
Then it will not be a Boolean
matrix, but some authors will

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24927-1
02:01:43.587 --> 02:01:46.071
prefer to write 1 here instead
of a three.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24929-0
02:01:47.101 --> 02:01:47.431
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24957-0
02:01:47.441 --> 02:01:50.815
So they will ignore this
multiple edges and they will

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24957-1
02:01:50.815 --> 02:01:54.501
just account it as one yes to
maintain it as a bit matrix.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24960-0
02:01:55.071 --> 02:01:55.711
That is also fine.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24979-0
02:01:56.471 --> 02:01:59.749
What is a better practice where
you actually count it and put it

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24979-1
02:01:59.749 --> 02:02:00.051
there?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24989-0
02:02:01.331 --> 02:02:04.181
All undirected will not be
always symmetrical, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/24997-0
02:02:04.191 --> 02:02:05.821
No, if it is definitely.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/25006-0
02:02:06.131 --> 02:02:08.441
If it is an undirected graph, it
will be symmetric.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/25014-0
02:02:08.911 --> 02:02:10.081
There is no doubts about it.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/25016-0
02:02:10.671 --> 02:02:11.161
Yeah, Arif.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/25029-0
02:02:13.241 --> 02:02:16.491
All undirected graphs metrics
will look symmetrical.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/25033-0
02:02:16.921 --> 02:02:17.171
Simple.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/25038-0
02:02:17.951 --> 02:02:18.941
This is an undirected graph.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/25043-0
02:02:18.951 --> 02:02:19.731
It is symmetric, right?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/25062-0
02:02:19.741 --> 02:02:23.681
This is 111 match this 00, this
one one this 33 it is symmetric.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/25066-0
02:02:25.911 --> 02:02:26.121
Cool.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/25073-0
02:02:26.131 --> 02:02:27.621
That being said, we will pause
here.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/25081-0
02:02:27.631 --> 02:02:29.111
We will come back the next
class.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/25090-0
02:02:29.121 --> 02:02:30.781
Uh, which is after the new year.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/25108-0
02:02:31.151 --> 02:02:33.761
What we will do is we will look
at the third one right.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/25112-0
02:02:33.771 --> 02:02:34.921
I told you three things.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/25118-0
02:02:35.391 --> 02:02:37.041
This adjacency list is pending.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/25148-0
02:02:37.431 --> 02:02:40.682
We will look at that and then we
will look at two different

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/25148-1
02:02:40.682 --> 02:02:44.258
traversal techniques and then we
will pause graphs and we will go

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/25148-2
02:02:44.258 --> 02:02:45.341
to some other thing.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/25152-0
02:02:45.861 --> 02:02:46.501
Yeah.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/25156-0
02:02:46.631 --> 02:02:47.401
Again, it repeat.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/25189-0
02:02:47.941 --> 02:02:51.045
Please watch the recordings
being sync, otherwise we will

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/25189-1
02:02:51.045 --> 02:02:54.149
spend a lot of time in just
revisiting what we have done,

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/25189-2
02:02:54.149 --> 02:02:56.021
which is not the best thing to
do.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/25196-0
02:02:56.561 --> 02:02:57.691
So let's try to do that.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/25204-0
02:02:57.941 --> 02:02:58.971
So all the excises.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/25210-0
02:02:58.981 --> 02:03:00.231
Watch out for the assignment.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/25222-0
02:03:00.241 --> 02:03:03.431
It will be live 7:00 PM today
and get started.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/25231-0
02:03:03.441 --> 02:03:04.481
Don't wait till the end.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/25247-0
02:03:04.621 --> 02:03:08.841
Trying to do that and I'll see
you again after uh, you know.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/25249-0
02:03:08.851 --> 02:03:09.021
A week?

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/25259-0
02:03:10.151 --> 02:03:11.811
Yeah, happy New Year and see you
again.

ccd5f758-0682-4bb1-8cb4-793b0c226093/25262-0
02:03:12.821 --> 02:03:13.041
Bye, bye.
