00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:29.312
We'll wait for another couple of
minutes and then we'll get

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/70-1
00:00:29.312 --> 00:00:29.889
started, yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/79-0
00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:43.429
Hi, good morning.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/94-0
00:00:54.599 --> 00:00:56.819
Yeah, you can just put it as
100% per head, yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/115-0
00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:03.844
If all of them have equally
contributed, then you can put

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/115-1
00:01:03.844 --> 00:01:04.899
100% for all of them.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/134-0
00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:30.559
So in general, how are things?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/143-0
00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:37.939
Have you taken any resolutions?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/149-0
00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.759
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/161-0
00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:45.798
The way we are two slides will
be attached to the same

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/161-1
00:01:45.798 --> 00:01:46.499
announcement, yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/182-0
00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:51.713
I was maybe not too, by the way,
did you all get a chance to

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/182-1
00:01:51.713 --> 00:01:52.099
attend it?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/190-0
00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:57.159
And yeah, for a change.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/205-0
00:01:57.169 --> 00:02:00.656
What I've done is I've given you
a chance to unmute yourself

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/205-1
00:02:00.656 --> 00:02:00.999
today.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/213-0
00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:02.619
Yeah, just to try it out.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/231-0
00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:09.073
So I request all of you to stay
on mute in between after every

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/231-1
00:02:09.073 --> 00:02:09.759
concept.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/237-0
00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:10.459
Or so I will.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/244-0
00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:11.739
You know, give you a chance.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/251-0
00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:14.759
And at that time you can unmute
yourself, yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/255-0
00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:20.059
OK, OK.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/268-0
00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:44.489
Yeah, I would do that.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/278-0
00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:46.429
Yeah, they don't worry about
that.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/297-0
00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:49.987
The portions will be everything
that we cover till the last

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/297-1
00:02:49.987 --> 00:02:51.619
class that is the next class.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/299-0
00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:52.159
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/340-0
00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:55.387
So today we are in the seventh
session and the next session

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/340-1
00:02:55.387 --> 00:02:58.808
will be the next weekend, which
is the 8th class and whatever we

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/340-2
00:02:58.808 --> 00:03:01.019
cover till that day will be the
portions.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/347-0
00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:02.479
But don't worry about that.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/359-0
00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:05.279
I will also be posting an
announcement after that class.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/403-0
00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:09.504
I'll also be discussing with the
other section professor, and we

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/403-1
00:03:09.504 --> 00:03:13.281
will, you know, put a complete
announcement on the syllabus and

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/403-2
00:03:13.281 --> 00:03:16.526
then resource wise I have
iterated this several times,

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/403-3
00:03:16.526 --> 00:03:18.119
which is go over and above.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/415-0
00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:20.329
The first thing would be your
recordings.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/451-0
00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:23.831
Your PT, your class notes, and
so on, and then the next step

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/451-1
00:03:23.831 --> 00:03:26.866
would be your textbooks
reference books and then the

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/451-2
00:03:26.866 --> 00:03:30.129
third step would be above that
right, which is practice.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/459-0
00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:32.699
Some Internet questions, past
papers and so on.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/472-0
00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.642
I'll also be uploading the past
paper after the next session,

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/472-1
00:03:36.642 --> 00:03:36.939
yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/491-0
00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:56.059
There's another question my
query, especially in case uh,

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/491-1
00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.179
no.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/503-0
00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:58.819
For PS questions, please post it
in the discussion.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/512-0
00:03:58.869 --> 00:04:01.479
I'll not be answering those in
the classes.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/525-0
00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:04.867
There's a dedicated thread
created for all the problem

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/525-1
00:04:04.867 --> 00:04:05.439
statements.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/561-0
00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:08.799
If it's problem statement eight,
you would have to just go there

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/561-1
00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.639
and ask your question and if you
have already done that and if

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/561-2
00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:14.299
you have not got your answer, it
will be done today, yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/590-0
00:04:19.929 --> 00:04:22.920
And if you have any assumptions
and so on while solving the

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/590-1
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.160
problem, state all of them very
clearly in the document that you

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/590-2
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.559
prepare.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/594-0
00:04:27.089 --> 00:04:27.719
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/605-0
00:04:27.799 --> 00:04:29.749
So that is 1 bundle of a
deliverable.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/622-0
00:04:29.829 --> 00:04:32.449
Your code as well as your
explanations, whatever

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/622-1
00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:33.839
assumptions you have made.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/638-0
00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:37.065
If you just call it out in your
report, then it'll be evaluated

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/638-1
00:04:37.065 --> 00:04:37.969
accordingly, yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/643-0
00:04:43.209 --> 00:04:43.449
Cool.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/659-0
00:04:43.459 --> 00:04:46.374
I think it's good time for us to
get started, so let's quickly

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/659-1
00:04:46.374 --> 00:04:46.929
get started.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/691-0
00:04:47.239 --> 00:04:50.713
So welcome to the 7th contact
vision for data structures and

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/691-1
00:04:50.713 --> 00:04:54.130
algorithm design and what we
will be doing today is we will

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/691-2
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.269
continue with graph.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/717-0
00:04:55.359 --> 00:04:58.775
We will see graph traversals and
so on, and then we will move on

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/717-1
00:04:58.775 --> 00:05:00.929
to another important concept
called BST.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/721-0
00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:01.829
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/737-0
00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:04.941
So most of you attended the last
class, So what did we do in the

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/737-1
00:05:04.941 --> 00:05:05.459
last class?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/741-0
00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:08.289
Real quick, yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/756-0
00:05:16.489 --> 00:05:18.419
What exactly did we do in the
last class?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/759-0
00:05:18.929 --> 00:05:19.719
Three is in graphs.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/761-0
00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:20.119
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/768-0
00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:21.309
Was it really trees?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/775-0
00:05:22.079 --> 00:05:23.279
But was it a special tree?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/789-0
00:05:24.459 --> 00:05:26.949
Yeah, giving you hints it was
not trees.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/800-0
00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:32.409
It was a special tree, which is
nothing but heaps, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/807-0
00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:33.589
So we completed heaps.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/821-0
00:05:33.799 --> 00:05:37.179
We had seen some examples of or
applications of heaps with.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/867-0
00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:40.960
There's nothing but heapsort and
priority queues, and then we got

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/867-1
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.502
started with this new concept of
graphs, and we learned about

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/867-2
00:05:44.502 --> 00:05:48.102
what exactly is a graph and you
know what is the terminologies

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/867-3
00:05:48.102 --> 00:05:48.959
involved in it?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/869-0
00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:49.899
Right.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/882-0
00:05:50.269 --> 00:05:54.179
And then a lot of you know,
types of graphs, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/892-0
00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:56.099
Simple graph paths and all that.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/909-0
00:05:56.409 --> 00:06:00.714
And finally, we had also seen
this whole topic of how do you

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/909-1
00:06:00.714 --> 00:06:02.479
represent a graph, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/919-0
00:06:02.489 --> 00:06:03.799
We'll quickly have a recap of
that.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/942-0
00:06:03.809 --> 00:06:06.763
Also, there was one more
technique which was pending, so

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/942-1
00:06:06.763 --> 00:06:09.769
we will complete that and then
we will go for traversals.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/944-0
00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:11.229
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/953-0
00:06:11.239 --> 00:06:12.329
Adjacency matrix.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/958-0
00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:13.529
Is that clear for everyone?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/982-0
00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:17.348
It's a very simple technique
where you use a matrix right

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/982-1
00:06:17.348 --> 00:06:20.169
where you use a matrix to
represent your graph.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1002-0
00:06:21.399 --> 00:06:25.183
The number of rows and number of
columns in the graph will be

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1002-1
00:06:25.183 --> 00:06:27.929
exactly equal to the number of
nodes, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1011-0
00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:29.849
So how many nodes are there in
this graph?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1021-0
00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:38.019
Yeah, 5 notes.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1024-0
00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:38.119
Why notes?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1032-0
00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:39.489
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1035-0
00:06:39.539 --> 00:06:42.329
So here you have 5 cross five
matrix right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1040-0
00:06:42.339 --> 00:06:42.989
Simple as that.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1067-0
00:06:43.059 --> 00:06:46.365
So for any given graph, when you
want to denote it in the

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1067-1
00:06:46.365 --> 00:06:49.729
representation of a system, you
will use N cross N matrix.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1084-0
00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:53.392
So that simply means that our
matrix will always be here

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1084-1
00:06:53.392 --> 00:06:54.579
square matrix, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1116-0
00:06:54.589 --> 00:06:58.502
It will always be N cross north
and inside that if there is a

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1116-1
00:06:58.502 --> 00:07:02.099
particular edge from V1 to V2,
you will put it as a one.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1129-0
00:07:02.149 --> 00:07:05.369
Otherwise you'll put it as a
zero, and so on, and rarely.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1142-0
00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:07.899
What you can also do is if there
are multiple edges.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1171-0
00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:11.596
So in this case, from V5 to V2,
there are three edges, so we can

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1171-1
00:07:11.596 --> 00:07:14.489
count that as three, and we can
also denote it as.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1192-0
00:07:14.549 --> 00:07:18.039
So we 2 to V5 as three and V5 to
V2 is also three.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1213-0
00:07:19.309 --> 00:07:23.194
So it taken some examples like
these and we also told that if

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1213-1
00:07:23.194 --> 00:07:25.889
it is a undirected graph like
this, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1220-0
00:07:25.899 --> 00:07:26.979
So there are no directions here.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1238-0
00:07:26.989 --> 00:07:30.859
It's an undirected graph for an
undirected graph, the matrix

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1238-1
00:07:30.859 --> 00:07:33.079
will always look symmetric,
right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1262-0
00:07:33.089 --> 00:07:36.501
If you just imagine you put a
line on this principal diagonal,

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1262-1
00:07:36.501 --> 00:07:39.479
and if you fold this matrix
right, it'll be symmetric.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1272-0
00:07:39.489 --> 00:07:41.059
So this one will overlap this
one.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1281-0
00:07:41.329 --> 00:07:42.859
This zero will overlap this
zero.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1302-0
00:07:43.149 --> 00:07:45.939
This one will overlap this one
this three with this three

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1302-1
00:07:45.939 --> 00:07:47.719
right, so it is symmetric in
nature.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1330-0
00:07:48.169 --> 00:07:51.908
So just by looking at a matrix
you will get to know if it is

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1330-1
00:07:51.908 --> 00:07:55.341
the matrix of her undirected
graph or a directed graph,

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1330-2
00:07:55.341 --> 00:07:55.709
right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1345-0
00:07:57.589 --> 00:07:59.429
So is this clear for all of you
real quick?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1346-0
00:07:59.449 --> 00:07:59.799
That.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1366-0
00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:04.339
Can you explain it to me one
more time was not clear much.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1361-0
00:08:05.009 --> 00:08:05.259
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1372-0
00:08:05.269 --> 00:08:06.289
Which part is not clear.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1383-0
00:08:07.399 --> 00:08:10.709
How do you this matrix was
defined based on this graph?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1392-0
00:08:12.529 --> 00:08:14.239
OK, real quick, let's do this.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1396-0
00:08:14.249 --> 00:08:15.139
I again urge you.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1417-0
00:08:15.149 --> 00:08:18.443
Please watch recordings of the
last classes we had completed

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1417-1
00:08:18.443 --> 00:08:19.469
all this long back.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1422-0
00:08:20.599 --> 00:08:22.109
So let's take another graph.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1457-0
00:08:22.159 --> 00:08:26.201
You have ABC and let's say from
A to B you have an edge and from

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1457-1
00:08:26.201 --> 00:08:30.119
B to C you have an edge and from
A to C also you have an edge.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1467-0
00:08:30.129 --> 00:08:32.099
It's a very small directed
graph.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1492-0
00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:36.472
If you want to represent it in a
matrix, then the number of nodes

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1492-1
00:08:36.472 --> 00:08:38.819
here are three, so you'll take
ABC.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1501-0
00:08:40.099 --> 00:08:41.839
You again take here ABC.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1512-0
00:08:43.519 --> 00:08:45.109
Is there it's going from A to a?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1515-0
00:08:45.259 --> 00:08:45.529
No.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1519-0
00:08:45.719 --> 00:08:46.349
So it's a zero.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1524-0
00:08:46.779 --> 00:08:47.869
What about B2B?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1528-0
00:08:47.879 --> 00:08:47.999
No.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1531-0
00:08:48.599 --> 00:08:49.619
What about C2C?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1534-0
00:08:49.679 --> 00:08:49.909
No.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1546-0
00:08:50.239 --> 00:08:52.629
So put it as zero from A to B.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1555-0
00:08:52.639 --> 00:08:54.689
There is an edge going right
from A to B.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1587-0
00:08:54.699 --> 00:08:58.153
There is an edge here, so A to B
will put it as a one from A to C

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1587-1
00:08:58.153 --> 00:09:00.979
also there is a edge here, so
we'll pull it as a one.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1596-0
00:09:02.009 --> 00:09:04.019
What about B2A for B2A?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1639-0
00:09:04.029 --> 00:09:08.732
There is no edge going there, so
B2A0 from B to C yes, there is

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1639-1
00:09:08.732 --> 00:09:13.435
this edge, so it is the one from
C from see, you don't have any

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1639-2
00:09:13.435 --> 00:09:15.199
age going to a nor to B.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1658-0
00:09:15.409 --> 00:09:18.582
So these two are zeros, so this
is the representation of this

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1658-1
00:09:18.582 --> 00:09:18.889
graph.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1691-0
00:09:19.829 --> 00:09:22.393
If at all you have parallel
edges right, for example, you

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1691-1
00:09:22.393 --> 00:09:25.179
have one more edge from A to B,
then you can count it as there

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1691-2
00:09:25.179 --> 00:09:26.019
are two edges here.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1698-0
00:09:26.269 --> 00:09:27.729
So here you can represent the
test.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1702-0
00:09:28.939 --> 00:09:29.149
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1725-0
00:09:29.159 --> 00:09:32.177
Is this clear now for all of you
the same way you can represent

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1725-1
00:09:32.177 --> 00:09:33.309
it for undirected edges.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1752-0
00:09:33.319 --> 00:09:37.135
Also right N cross N matrix,
just put it as zeros or ones if

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1752-1
00:09:37.135 --> 00:09:40.889
at all there are parallel edges,
count it and put it in the

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1752-2
00:09:40.889 --> 00:09:41.389
metrics.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1765-0
00:09:42.609 --> 00:09:44.789
So what are the advantages and
disadvantages of this?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1771-0
00:09:45.379 --> 00:09:47.309
Yes, Sir, this is clear.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1784-0
00:09:47.319 --> 00:09:49.879
But one thing I not need to ask
you here.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1807-0
00:09:49.889 --> 00:09:52.764
When you gave the example, it
was pretty easy to understand

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1807-1
00:09:52.764 --> 00:09:54.729
because there was a directed
graph like.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1826-0
00:09:54.739 --> 00:09:57.387
The arrows are when you say
directed graph it is you mean

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1817-0
00:09:55.059 --> 00:09:55.259
Right.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1826-1
00:09:57.387 --> 00:09:58.209
the arrows, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1832-0
00:09:58.879 --> 00:09:59.079
Correct.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1828-0
00:09:59.929 --> 00:10:00.329
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1860-0
00:10:07.859 --> 00:10:08.069
Correct.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1879-0
00:10:08.169 --> 00:10:10.459
But becomes little bit difficult
to understand.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1884-0
00:10:10.609 --> 00:10:13.795
So if it is not even having
arrows, what does it really

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1884-1
00:10:13.795 --> 00:10:14.079
mean?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1898-0
00:10:14.159 --> 00:10:16.899
It simply means that you can go
from V1 to V2.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1909-0
00:10:16.969 --> 00:10:19.049
You can go from V2 to V1, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1924-0
00:10:19.059 --> 00:10:20.999
So in both those cells you will
have one.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1942-0
00:10:21.159 --> 00:10:26.165
So let me redraw this graph ABC
and let's draw the same thing

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1942-1
00:10:26.165 --> 00:10:26.649
again.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1947-0
00:10:27.939 --> 00:10:29.139
Something like this, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1971-0
00:10:29.149 --> 00:10:32.682
This is what you have and if you
want to draw the metrics for

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1971-1
00:10:32.682 --> 00:10:34.049
this right you have ABC.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1992-0
00:10:34.459 --> 00:10:38.035
You have ABC now the whole
scenario changes right from A to

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/1992-1
00:10:38.035 --> 00:10:40.359
a, B to BC, to C to zero again,
right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2039-0
00:10:40.369 --> 00:10:44.457
Because there is no edges from A
to a like the self loop from A

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2039-1
00:10:44.457 --> 00:10:48.353
to B, there is a edge which
means you can go from A to B and

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2039-2
00:10:48.353 --> 00:10:50.269
you can come from B to a also.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2056-0
00:10:50.699 --> 00:10:53.639
So A to B becomes A1B2A also
becomes A1.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2089-0
00:10:54.509 --> 00:10:58.962
Similarly, from A to C, there is
age so which simply means you

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2089-1
00:10:58.962 --> 00:11:01.789
can go from A to C as well as
from C2A.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2106-0
00:11:02.049 --> 00:11:04.889
So from A to C it is A1 from
C2AL, so it is A1.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2128-0
00:11:06.149 --> 00:11:11.157
Similarly from B2C from B to C
and C2B, this is the matrix for

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2128-1
00:11:11.157 --> 00:11:12.509
undirected graph.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2147-0
00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:16.879
Yeah, all good simple stuff.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2134-0
00:11:14.939 --> 00:11:15.369
Thanks.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2136-0
00:11:15.839 --> 00:11:16.139
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2155-0
00:11:15.899 --> 00:11:20.469
Ohh I'd tell no but but then the
given example, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2145-0
00:11:16.149 --> 00:11:16.679
Yeah. Thanks.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2172-0
00:11:20.479 --> 00:11:23.919
So only the diagonal will be 0
or should be one, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2186-0
00:11:24.439 --> 00:11:27.239
The given example here equal to
01001.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2188-0
00:11:28.019 --> 00:11:29.209
No, not at all, right.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2201-0
00:11:29.219 --> 00:11:32.249
For example, the first one just
try to name these.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2216-0
00:11:34.389 --> 00:11:36.339
This is we want this is V2.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2221-0
00:11:36.769 --> 00:11:37.569
This is V3.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2226-0
00:11:37.579 --> 00:11:38.379
This is V4.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2231-0
00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:39.109
This is V5.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2236-0
00:11:39.869 --> 00:11:40.789
This is V1.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2241-0
00:11:40.799 --> 00:11:41.519
This is V2.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2246-0
00:11:41.529 --> 00:11:42.299
This is V3.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2251-0
00:11:42.309 --> 00:11:43.099
This is V4.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2255-0
00:11:43.109 --> 00:11:44.759
This is V5 right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2287-0
00:11:44.989 --> 00:11:48.831
So in this case the diagonals
are zero, no problem, but from

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2287-1
00:11:48.831 --> 00:11:51.099
V1 to V3 also V3 that it is a
zero.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2291-0
00:11:51.109 --> 00:11:51.769
Why is that?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2309-0
00:11:52.129 --> 00:11:55.619
Because in the graph from V1 to
V3 I don't have an edge.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2315-0
00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:57.079
Do I have edge going here?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2319-0
00:11:57.449 --> 00:11:57.719
No.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2330-0
00:11:58.029 --> 00:12:00.619
So that is also zero from V1 to
V4.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2339-0
00:12:00.629 --> 00:12:02.199
There is no edge, so that is
also zero.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2351-0
00:12:02.779 --> 00:12:04.729
Ah, no thank you.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2357-0
00:12:04.099 --> 00:12:07.739
Right, so all the edges alone we
should consider. Right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2361-0
00:12:09.129 --> 00:12:09.619
Cool.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2392-0
00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:12.762
I believe now this is, you know,
pretty clear if there's a graph

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2392-1
00:12:12.762 --> 00:12:15.289
given you should be able to
translate it into a matrix.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2408-0
00:12:16.599 --> 00:12:19.013
If a matrix is given, you should
be able to translate it back

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2408-1
00:12:19.013 --> 00:12:19.519
into a graph.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2411-0
00:12:20.829 --> 00:12:21.119
Great.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2448-0
00:12:21.129 --> 00:12:23.571
You'll just, you know, put the
number of nodes and then

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2448-1
00:12:23.571 --> 00:12:26.144
wherever there is a one, you
will try to add edge wherever

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2448-2
00:12:26.144 --> 00:12:28.019
there is a zero, you will not
add an edge.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2456-0
00:12:28.109 --> 00:12:31.459
You'll be able to reconstruct
the graph back, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2489-0
00:12:31.769 --> 00:12:35.544
So the very first advantage is
it is very fast to tell whether

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2489-1
00:12:35.544 --> 00:12:38.960
an edge exists between two
vertices or not, because it's

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2489-2
00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:39.679
very simple.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2506-0
00:12:40.249 --> 00:12:44.604
In this example, I want to know
if we four is connected to V2,

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2506-1
00:12:44.604 --> 00:12:45.019
right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2516-0
00:12:45.059 --> 00:12:48.089
All that I'll have to do is go
to V4.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2523-0
00:12:48.099 --> 00:12:48.989
There is the V2.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2535-0
00:12:49.179 --> 00:12:51.809
I'll take this cell if that is a
zero.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2545-0
00:12:51.899 --> 00:12:54.009
It means that they don't have a
connection right.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2553-0
00:12:54.019 --> 00:12:55.009
There is no edge between them.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2587-0
00:12:56.249 --> 00:12:59.813
If it is a one, it means there
is a edge between them, so it is

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2587-1
00:12:59.813 --> 00:13:03.265
very fast to tell me whether
there is a edge existing between

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2587-2
00:13:03.265 --> 00:13:04.379
two vertices or not.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2608-0
00:13:04.909 --> 00:13:07.943
It's as simple as going and
inspecting the matrix for a one

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2608-1
00:13:07.943 --> 00:13:08.449
or a zero.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2618-0
00:13:09.229 --> 00:13:11.849
It's very easy to, but what
other disadvantages?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2633-0
00:13:13.649 --> 00:13:17.379
It consumes a lot of memory on
sparse graphs, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2645-0
00:13:17.389 --> 00:13:19.379
So what really is a sparse graph
now?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2654-0
00:13:19.909 --> 00:13:21.239
So there are two types of
graphs.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2665-0
00:13:21.289 --> 00:13:23.239
Yeah, sparse graph and dense
graphs.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2677-0
00:13:23.709 --> 00:13:27.759
So sparse graph is the one with
only few edges right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2689-0
00:13:27.769 --> 00:13:31.429
For example, let's assume I have
N is equal to 100.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2695-0
00:13:32.159 --> 00:13:32.619
What is it?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2698-0
00:13:33.349 --> 00:13:34.339
The number of nodes.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2708-0
00:13:34.349 --> 00:13:37.579
Yeah, I have 100 nodes in my
graph, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2722-0
00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:44.199
But let's assume I have only 45
or 50 edges, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2728-0
00:13:44.209 --> 00:13:45.699
I have connected something like
this.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2736-0
00:13:47.659 --> 00:13:48.429
Only few edges.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2769-0
00:13:48.439 --> 00:13:52.048
I have not many edges I have so
such a graph is called as a

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2769-1
00:13:52.048 --> 00:13:55.777
sparse graph where you have a
lot of nodes, but you have only

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2769-2
00:13:55.777 --> 00:13:56.379
few edges.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2796-0
00:13:57.949 --> 00:14:02.256
On the other hand, there is a
concept called dense graph where

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2796-1
00:14:02.256 --> 00:14:06.289
you have a lot more edges than
the number of nodes, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2805-0
00:14:06.299 --> 00:14:09.269
For example same example, you
have 100 nodes, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2817-0
00:14:10.419 --> 00:14:13.589
But you have 200 edges right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2825-0
00:14:13.599 --> 00:14:15.659
In that case, what can you
comment about that graph?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2836-0
00:14:17.639 --> 00:14:18.969
What will be more in that graph?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2850-0
00:14:20.519 --> 00:14:22.749
I have under notes I have 200
edges.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2857-0
00:14:23.119 --> 00:14:24.269
Then what does it really mean?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2863-0
00:14:24.499 --> 00:14:25.849
What type of edges are more?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2869-0
00:14:27.819 --> 00:14:28.869
Yeah, exactly.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2873-0
00:14:28.879 --> 00:14:29.719
Krishna is bang on.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2886-0
00:14:29.729 --> 00:14:33.389
That is parallel edges, so all
of these are connected.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2907-0
00:14:33.399 --> 00:14:36.106
Apart from that I also have
parallel edges, meaning from the

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2907-1
00:14:36.106 --> 00:14:38.369
same node I have, you know,
extra things going on.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2930-0
00:14:38.679 --> 00:14:42.164
That is why there are a lot more
edges than the number of nodes,

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2930-1
00:14:42.164 --> 00:14:44.469
so lines are more than the
circles, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2947-0
00:14:44.659 --> 00:14:48.399
If you draw such a graph, that
is called as a dense graph,

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2947-1
00:14:48.399 --> 00:14:48.779
right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2965-0
00:14:50.379 --> 00:14:52.770
So we will learn about these
when the time comes in the later

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2965-1
00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:53.889
part of the semester as well.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2984-0
00:14:54.139 --> 00:14:57.320
So in some use cases we might
want to have a sparse graph

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/2984-1
00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:57.649
right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3014-0
00:14:57.659 --> 00:15:00.667
For example, Internet
connectivity in all your towns

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3014-1
00:15:00.667 --> 00:15:04.129
or cities, wherever you live,
your Internet service provider

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3014-2
00:15:04.129 --> 00:15:06.569
might want to just connect all
the houses.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3037-0
00:15:06.999 --> 00:15:09.876
They will not have a lot of
extra cabling from, you know,

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3037-1
00:15:09.876 --> 00:15:12.109
all the other houses like
duplicate cabling.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3073-0
00:15:12.439 --> 00:15:15.526
If one fails, let the other so
they're not going to do that

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3073-1
00:15:15.526 --> 00:15:18.612
because each cabling is money,
so they would want to have a

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3073-2
00:15:18.612 --> 00:15:20.979
sparse graph, whereas there are
dense graphs.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3092-0
00:15:20.989 --> 00:15:23.442
Also possible, there are some
examples when we'll see later in

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3092-1
00:15:23.442 --> 00:15:23.909
this course.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3105-0
00:15:24.339 --> 00:15:28.139
We'll just remember about it,
but what about the sparse graph?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3130-0
00:15:28.189 --> 00:15:31.863
So when you have a sparse graph
like this in our matrix

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3130-1
00:15:31.863 --> 00:15:34.159
representation, what would
happen?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3155-0
00:15:35.209 --> 00:15:40.035
There's a lot of nodes, so the
matrix is big, but inside that a

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3155-1
00:15:40.035 --> 00:15:42.599
lot of things will be a 0,
right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3180-0
00:15:43.039 --> 00:15:46.271
So it will be a wastage of
memory meaning a lot of cells

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3180-1
00:15:46.271 --> 00:15:47.859
inside the matrix are zeros.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3187-0
00:15:48.029 --> 00:15:49.919
So we are wasting it, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3191-0
00:15:49.929 --> 00:15:50.389
Exactly.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3234-0
00:15:50.399 --> 00:15:54.487
So that is a disadvantage if you
have a sparse graph, then this

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3234-1
00:15:54.487 --> 00:15:58.256
matrix representation is not
very efficient because anyway

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3234-2
00:15:58.256 --> 00:16:02.409
most of the cells are zeros and
also for undirected graphs there

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3234-3
00:16:02.409 --> 00:16:04.389
is redundant information right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3243-0
00:16:04.399 --> 00:16:06.169
Which is exactly what we were
looking at.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3265-0
00:16:06.419 --> 00:16:10.595
So if you look at this matrix,
this lower triangular and upper

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3265-1
00:16:10.595 --> 00:16:12.849
is actually the same, only
right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3291-0
00:16:12.979 --> 00:16:16.291
So this one and this one, this
one and this one, this one and

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3291-1
00:16:16.291 --> 00:16:19.069
this one this and this three and
this three, right.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3298-0
00:16:19.199 --> 00:16:21.149
So there is actually duplicate
information.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3316-0
00:16:21.659 --> 00:16:24.615
If you only give me the lower
part or higher part, that's

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3316-1
00:16:24.615 --> 00:16:25.329
enough for me.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3320-0
00:16:25.379 --> 00:16:26.209
I already know it.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3353-0
00:16:26.719 --> 00:16:30.266
So basically it means that
whenever you have an undirected

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3353-1
00:16:30.266 --> 00:16:33.091
graph, there is extra
information or redundant

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3353-2
00:16:33.091 --> 00:16:36.999
information in that matrix that
is also some small disadvantage.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3364-0
00:16:38.559 --> 00:16:40.369
So is the matrix representation
clear?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3386-0
00:16:40.659 --> 00:16:42.866
But in case of self loop, yeah,
in case of self loop you will

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3386-1
00:16:42.866 --> 00:16:43.649
also have a one there.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3397-0
00:16:43.839 --> 00:16:45.829
Yeah, in the diagonals also you
will have one.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3422-0
00:16:47.629 --> 00:16:50.387
Specifically for 100 Node 200
Edge graph, is it not necessary

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3422-1
00:16:50.387 --> 00:16:51.899
that it has parallel lines
right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3429-0
00:16:51.909 --> 00:16:54.049
Connecting the nodes completely
itself will take hundred.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3436-0
00:16:54.059 --> 00:16:54.989
Yeah, that's also correct.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3458-0
00:16:55.309 --> 00:16:59.479
Yeah, if you have completely
connected also that will be

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3458-1
00:16:59.479 --> 00:17:03.649
having more than 100 edges and
that is also dense graph.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3461-0
00:17:05.529 --> 00:17:05.979
Cool.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3475-0
00:17:06.029 --> 00:17:09.049
That being said, is there any
doubts for adjacency matrix?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3478-0
00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:10.919
We'll keep doing this.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3486-0
00:17:10.929 --> 00:17:11.949
Don't don't worry about it.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3504-0
00:17:12.179 --> 00:17:15.351
As the course progresses, we'll
keep creating such, you know,

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3504-1
00:17:15.351 --> 00:17:17.499
matrix representation for a
graph, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3512-0
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:20.469
How many number of nodes are
there?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3525-0
00:17:20.479 --> 00:17:22.819
Create that many number of North
Cross end matrix.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3540-0
00:17:22.989 --> 00:17:25.739
If there is an edge between two
nodes, put it as A1.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3550-0
00:17:26.009 --> 00:17:28.869
If there is no edge, put it as a
0, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3558-0
00:17:30.599 --> 00:17:32.029
So now what about that last
technique?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3566-0
00:17:32.039 --> 00:17:33.689
Right, which is called adjacency
list.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3590-0
00:17:33.779 --> 00:17:36.143
There's a lot of extra
information here which you can

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3590-1
00:17:36.143 --> 00:17:38.769
read offline, but I'll quickly
tell you what this is about.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3597-0
00:17:39.079 --> 00:17:40.369
Yeah, it's a very simple
concept.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3602-0
00:17:40.379 --> 00:17:41.799
Again, all of you, yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3607-0
00:17:43.849 --> 00:17:44.479
Real quick.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3613-0
00:17:45.009 --> 00:17:46.509
So what type of graph is this?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3621-0
00:17:49.139 --> 00:17:51.079
Yeah, woment.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3631-0
00:17:51.089 --> 00:17:53.210
When someone asked you like
this, what type of graph is

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3631-1
00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:53.399
this?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3639-0
00:17:54.179 --> 00:17:56.669
This is her undirected graph,
right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3671-0
00:17:56.719 --> 00:18:00.300
It doesn't have any arrows, so
it is an undirected graph

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3671-1
00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:03.880
involving how many nodes it has
seven nodes, so it is an

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3671-2
00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:06.079
undirected graph with seven
nodes.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3673-0
00:18:06.569 --> 00:18:07.199
Perfect.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3696-0
00:18:07.449 --> 00:18:10.943
So in this adjacency list
representation what we do is

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3696-1
00:18:10.943 --> 00:18:13.739
firstly we go ahead and we
create an array.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3702-0
00:18:14.049 --> 00:18:17.209
We create an array of N
elements, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3713-0
00:18:17.219 --> 00:18:18.739
So in this case, how many
elements are there?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3720-0
00:18:18.799 --> 00:18:19.939
How many nodes are there?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3723-0
00:18:19.949 --> 00:18:20.259
Seven.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3728-0
00:18:20.489 --> 00:18:21.519
So I'll create an array.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3733-0
00:18:21.529 --> 00:18:22.199
This is that array.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3751-0
00:18:23.269 --> 00:18:26.677
This is that array with N
elements and this is nothing but

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3751-1
00:18:26.677 --> 00:18:27.139
N nodes.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3753-0
00:18:28.559 --> 00:18:28.769
Done.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3772-0
00:18:30.059 --> 00:18:32.869
You named it with the node names
which is 1234567.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3786-0
00:18:33.869 --> 00:18:36.899
Now the next step is you go
ahead and pick up each node.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3799-0
00:18:37.009 --> 00:18:40.039
So I pick one wall, are adjacent
to one.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3816-0
00:18:41.919 --> 00:18:45.633
Yeah, we all are directly
connected to one or adjacent to

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3816-1
00:18:45.633 --> 00:18:45.889
one.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3818-0
00:18:46.059 --> 00:18:46.449
Who are they?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3825-0
00:18:48.629 --> 00:18:49.429
Who is connected?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3832-0
00:18:49.749 --> 00:18:51.279
Five is connected, six is
connected.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3847-0
00:18:52.099 --> 00:18:56.689
So for 2/5 and six, go ahead and
create a link list node.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3856-0
00:18:56.759 --> 00:18:58.029
Yeah, you learned about linked
list.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3867-0
00:18:58.179 --> 00:19:00.429
Please remember that you'll
create a node.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3874-0
00:19:00.439 --> 00:19:01.849
You will create a pointer,
right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3888-0
00:19:02.299 --> 00:19:04.329
So you created a node for two.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3898-0
00:19:04.379 --> 00:19:05.509
You create a node for file.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3905-0
00:19:05.659 --> 00:19:06.969
You created a node for six.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3919-0
00:19:07.459 --> 00:19:11.769
You joined them and this whole
list you joined it to one.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3926-0
00:19:12.629 --> 00:19:14.599
So how do you now read this?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3955-0
00:19:14.789 --> 00:19:20.274
So the way to read this, the
correct representation is one is

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3955-1
00:19:20.274 --> 00:19:24.785
connected to two, one is
connected to five, one is

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3955-2
00:19:24.785 --> 00:19:26.289
connected to six.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3965-0
00:19:26.919 --> 00:19:29.349
It does not mean two and five
are connected.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3969-0
00:19:29.359 --> 00:19:30.509
Five and six are connected.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3979-0
00:19:30.719 --> 00:19:33.039
Yeah, a lot of newbies make this
mistake.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3983-0
00:19:33.049 --> 00:19:33.739
Don't make that.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3991-0
00:19:34.539 --> 00:19:36.429
I'll again repeat this very
small concept.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/3996-0
00:19:36.439 --> 00:19:37.049
Pick a node.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4006-0
00:19:37.379 --> 00:19:38.899
Yeah, for example, you go ahead
and pick three.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4019-0
00:19:40.179 --> 00:19:43.409
All are adjacent to 3/3 is
connected to two.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4036-0
00:19:43.579 --> 00:19:47.626
Please connected to four so
create a linked list using these

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4036-1
00:19:47.626 --> 00:19:48.489
two elements.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4054-0
00:19:48.719 --> 00:19:52.626
Either you can create it as two
which then points to four, or it

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4054-1
00:19:52.626 --> 00:19:54.009
is your representation.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4077-0
00:19:54.019 --> 00:19:57.393
You can also have four first
then which is pointing to two,

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4077-1
00:19:57.393 --> 00:19:59.699
the cruxes for whatever nodes
are there.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4104-0
00:19:59.769 --> 00:20:03.096
Go ahead and create the nodes
and now join that to the actual

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4104-1
00:20:03.096 --> 00:20:05.779
node that you're inspecting, so
you are in three.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4110-0
00:20:05.849 --> 00:20:08.119
So join that there two and four.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4139-0
00:20:08.229 --> 00:20:11.747
So this order doesn't matter
because the way you are

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4139-1
00:20:11.747 --> 00:20:15.464
interpreting this is 3 is
connected to two and three is

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4139-2
00:20:15.464 --> 00:20:16.659
connected to four.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4148-0
00:20:17.239 --> 00:20:19.609
There is no relation between
these things.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4164-0
00:20:19.619 --> 00:20:21.702
Yeah, a lot of students will
believe you have one is also

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4164-1
00:20:21.702 --> 00:20:22.349
connected to five.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4170-0
00:20:22.649 --> 00:20:23.849
Four is connected to five.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4179-0
00:20:23.859 --> 00:20:25.149
Five is connected to two no.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4187-0
00:20:25.789 --> 00:20:27.629
How do you read the last line?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4212-0
00:20:28.179 --> 00:20:31.699
The correct way to read the last
line is 7 is connected to four

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4212-1
00:20:31.699 --> 00:20:35.109
and seven is connected to five
and seven is connected to two.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4214-0
00:20:36.559 --> 00:20:37.129
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4225-0
00:20:37.199 --> 00:20:39.149
Is this representation clear for
all of you?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4234-0
00:20:39.219 --> 00:20:40.229
This could have been the other
way.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4252-0
00:20:40.239 --> 00:20:43.138
Also, seven is connected to say
first node was two, then you had

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4252-1
00:20:43.138 --> 00:20:44.209
five, then you had four.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4257-0
00:20:44.319 --> 00:20:45.079
Any form is fine.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4260-0
00:20:46.779 --> 00:20:47.069
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4266-0
00:20:47.079 --> 00:20:47.569
Is this clear?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4272-0
00:20:47.579 --> 00:20:50.119
Guys, all of you very simple
concept.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4286-0
00:20:51.429 --> 00:20:55.019
First create an array with an
elements, right name them.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4314-0
00:20:55.029 --> 00:20:57.922
As you know, each of those
nodes, then for each of those

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4314-1
00:20:57.922 --> 00:21:01.018
nodes see who all are adjacent
to him, who all are connected

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4314-2
00:21:01.018 --> 00:21:01.779
directly to it.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4328-0
00:21:02.169 --> 00:21:05.775
For those elements, create a
linked list and attach it to our

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4328-1
00:21:05.775 --> 00:21:06.589
array element.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4331-0
00:21:07.509 --> 00:21:08.299
Simple stuff.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4343-0
00:21:08.609 --> 00:21:11.529
Yeah, this is called the
adjacency list representation.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4353-0
00:21:13.359 --> 00:21:14.529
What are the advantages of it?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4381-0
00:21:14.959 --> 00:21:18.125
New nodes can be added easily
because all that we are doing is

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4381-1
00:21:18.125 --> 00:21:20.789
just creating a linked list for
it and attaching it.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4389-0
00:21:21.539 --> 00:21:23.699
New notes can be connected with
existing nodes.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4393-0
00:21:23.709 --> 00:21:23.969
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4396-0
00:21:23.979 --> 00:21:25.049
Again, the same concept.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4437-0
00:21:25.639 --> 00:21:29.659
Who are my neighbors can easily
be answered correct, because all

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4437-1
00:21:29.659 --> 00:21:33.309
that I'll have to do is say
suppose I want to know who all

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4437-2
00:21:33.309 --> 00:21:36.772
our neighbors to fight or who
all are connected to file

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4437-3
00:21:36.772 --> 00:21:37.329
directly.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4457-0
00:21:37.799 --> 00:21:40.603
All that I'll have to do is I'll
have to come to that particular

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4457-1
00:21:40.603 --> 00:21:41.509
element in the array.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4472-0
00:21:41.999 --> 00:21:44.999
I'll have to just traverse its
connected linked list.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4485-0
00:21:45.009 --> 00:21:47.919
That will tell me who all are
adjacent to me. Right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4491-0
00:21:49.009 --> 00:21:50.119
That's very simple for me.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4497-0
00:21:51.029 --> 00:21:51.889
That's also an advantage.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4505-0
00:21:52.829 --> 00:21:54.599
There's some questions if there
is, uh.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4518-0
00:21:54.609 --> 00:21:56.953
Directional then link list will
have uh elements in the

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4518-1
00:21:56.953 --> 00:21:57.539
directionally.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4532-0
00:21:57.549 --> 00:22:00.769
No, that that also is and you
know order doesn't matter.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4569-0
00:22:00.869 --> 00:22:04.172
The same concept holds good even
if this graph was, you know,

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4569-1
00:22:04.172 --> 00:22:07.209
directed or undirected, it
doesn't matter, you will just

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4569-2
00:22:07.209 --> 00:22:10.459
see who all are connected to
this one right, irrespective of

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4569-3
00:22:10.459 --> 00:22:10.619
it.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4583-0
00:22:10.629 --> 00:22:13.963
You will take those elements and
you will put them in the linked

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4583-1
00:22:13.963 --> 00:22:14.579
list, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4592-0
00:22:16.119 --> 00:22:17.529
But you will just see who all
are.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4608-0
00:22:18.419 --> 00:22:21.329
Adjacent meaning who all are
going from that one, right.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4618-0
00:22:21.419 --> 00:22:24.199
Not the ones that are coming in
and so on, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4626-0
00:22:24.209 --> 00:22:27.129
Only the outward you will
consider, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4633-0
00:22:28.659 --> 00:22:30.529
But what are the disadvantages
here?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4650-0
00:22:30.619 --> 00:22:33.818
Yeah, there is one pages
determining whether an edge

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4650-1
00:22:33.818 --> 00:22:35.749
exists between two nodes or not.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4659-0
00:22:36.039 --> 00:22:37.089
Yeah, I ask you a question.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4675-0
00:22:37.099 --> 00:22:40.573
In this graph, you'll have to
tell me if five is connected to

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4675-1
00:22:40.573 --> 00:22:41.189
two or not.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4684-0
00:22:42.309 --> 00:22:43.459
So what will be our approach?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4695-0
00:22:43.589 --> 00:22:45.329
Will first go to that five
right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4715-0
00:22:46.199 --> 00:22:51.283
And if five is connected to two,
then there will be a link list

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4715-1
00:22:51.283 --> 00:22:53.269
with the node 2, correct?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4721-0
00:22:53.279 --> 00:22:54.199
That is what I'm looking for.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4727-0
00:22:55.149 --> 00:22:56.079
I'll take this address.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4732-0
00:22:56.089 --> 00:22:56.679
I'll go there.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4737-0
00:22:56.729 --> 00:22:57.259
It's six.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4745-0
00:22:57.269 --> 00:22:59.159
It is not two, so I'll take the
address.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4749-0
00:22:59.169 --> 00:22:59.459
I'll go.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4760-0
00:22:59.469 --> 00:23:01.199
Here it is one it is not two.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4765-0
00:23:01.329 --> 00:23:02.579
So again I traverse again.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4771-0
00:23:02.589 --> 00:23:04.339
I traverse finally at this.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4811-0
00:23:04.349 --> 00:23:08.242
This is the end of the list, but
I did not see two, so at this

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4811-1
00:23:08.242 --> 00:23:11.950
moment is when I can conclude
that five is not connected to

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4811-2
00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:14.669
two, meaning 5 doesn't have an
edge to two.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4820-0
00:23:16.259 --> 00:23:17.549
So what is the complexity here?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4836-0
00:23:17.559 --> 00:23:20.518
In a matrix, all that I could
have done is I'll go to that

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4836-1
00:23:20.518 --> 00:23:20.769
five.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4845-0
00:23:20.779 --> 00:23:21.669
I'll go to this too.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4857-0
00:23:21.879 --> 00:23:23.369
I'll see what is it value there?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4867-0
00:23:23.439 --> 00:23:24.789
If it was a one, there is an
edge.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4879-0
00:23:24.799 --> 00:23:27.209
If it does a zero, there is no
edge between them.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4904-0
00:23:27.439 --> 00:23:31.167
But here I had to go take that
element and traverse the whole

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4904-1
00:23:31.167 --> 00:23:31.889
linked list.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4913-0
00:23:33.209 --> 00:23:35.259
So traversing a linked list,
what is the complexity?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4920-0
00:23:36.079 --> 00:23:37.149
No, it is not in square.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4924-0
00:23:40.639 --> 00:23:41.419
Yeah, real quick.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4929-0
00:23:47.069 --> 00:23:47.609
Yeah, it is.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4933-0
00:23:47.619 --> 00:23:48.579
Yeah, that's right.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4938-0
00:23:49.089 --> 00:23:49.839
So which is bad?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4944-0
00:23:49.889 --> 00:23:50.259
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4969-0
00:23:50.329 --> 00:23:53.815
Whereas in a matrix that was big
of one, I can directly go check

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/4969-1
00:23:53.815 --> 00:23:55.799
that cell, it'll give me the
answer.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5000-0
00:23:56.169 --> 00:23:59.580
But here I'll have to just go
through the whole linked list

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5000-1
00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:03.218
and let's say suppose there is a
node which is connected to all

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5000-2
00:24:03.218 --> 00:24:04.469
the other edges right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5010-0
00:24:04.619 --> 00:24:06.329
So it means that that's the
worst case, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5048-0
00:24:06.479 --> 00:24:10.592
So one node will be connected to
all the other nodes in the

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5048-1
00:24:10.592 --> 00:24:14.705
linked list, so that is nothing
but traversing and elements

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5048-2
00:24:14.705 --> 00:24:17.379
which is big O of N cool simple
stuff.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5060-0
00:24:17.389 --> 00:24:20.269
Yeah, I have given a lot of
exercises.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5070-0
00:24:20.279 --> 00:24:22.909
The excises have already gone in
the last class slides.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5073-0
00:24:23.299 --> 00:24:23.669
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5076-0
00:24:23.719 --> 00:24:24.759
So please practice them.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5092-0
00:24:27.669 --> 00:24:31.039
Yes, no, the exercises are
nothing.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5100-0
00:24:30.609 --> 00:24:30.889
OK.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5107-0
00:24:31.049 --> 00:24:33.913
But I've given you a list,
you'll have to convert it into a

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5107-1
00:24:33.913 --> 00:24:34.199
graph.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5113-0
00:24:34.209 --> 00:24:34.909
I've given a graph.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5127-0
00:24:34.919 --> 00:24:38.041
You'll have to convert it into a
matrix just by looking at a

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5127-1
00:24:38.041 --> 00:24:38.399
matrix.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5141-0
00:24:38.489 --> 00:24:41.309
You should say if it is
directed, undirected and so on.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5143-0
00:24:43.179 --> 00:24:43.449
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5160-0
00:24:43.459 --> 00:24:46.727
So if you have no questions,
please mute yourself and we will

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5160-1
00:24:46.727 --> 00:24:47.149
proceed.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5168-0
00:24:48.389 --> 00:24:49.179
Yeah, so far, so good.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5175-0
00:24:49.189 --> 00:24:51.679
All of you for parallel
vertices.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5181-0
00:24:51.689 --> 00:24:52.889
Will there be a duplicate list?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5186-0
00:24:52.899 --> 00:24:53.469
Yes, exactly.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5193-0
00:24:53.479 --> 00:24:54.929
There will be a duplicate one
for parallel.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5209-0
00:24:56.599 --> 00:25:00.356
Yeah, inside this link list you
will have again one more there,

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5209-1
00:25:00.356 --> 00:25:00.649
yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5213-0
00:25:02.569 --> 00:25:02.919
Cool.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5223-0
00:25:02.929 --> 00:25:04.699
That being said, now what all do
you know?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5231-0
00:25:05.009 --> 00:25:06.319
You know what is a graph?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5242-0
00:25:06.329 --> 00:25:08.179
Graph is a set of you know nodes
vertices.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5251-0
00:25:08.629 --> 00:25:09.819
You know how it was created.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5261-0
00:25:09.829 --> 00:25:13.179
The applications of it and a lot
of terminologies, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5265-0
00:25:13.329 --> 00:25:14.309
What is degree?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5272-0
00:25:14.319 --> 00:25:16.919
What is, you know, subgraph?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5280-0
00:25:16.979 --> 00:25:19.099
What is a cut edge cut vertex?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5307-0
00:25:19.109 --> 00:25:23.196
A lot of adjacency and you know
those technologies and you also

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5307-1
00:25:23.196 --> 00:25:27.219
know how to represent a graph
using matrix and adjacency list.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5320-0
00:25:27.889 --> 00:25:30.179
So now you we will look at
traversals, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5334-0
00:25:30.589 --> 00:25:32.689
So what are the different ways
to traverse a tree?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5341-0
00:25:34.299 --> 00:25:37.169
You also told the webinar was
good, yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5353-0
00:25:41.059 --> 00:25:42.939
The inorder, postorder,
preorder.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5351-0
00:25:43.679 --> 00:25:44.269
Exactly.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5361-0
00:25:44.439 --> 00:25:46.189
Yeah, there are three ways to
traverse.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5376-0
00:25:46.459 --> 00:25:49.049
Mainly for a tree which is in
order postorder and preorder.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5411-0
00:25:49.709 --> 00:25:53.325
So similarly, what we can also
do for a graph is there are two

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5411-1
00:25:53.325 --> 00:25:56.654
ways which is breadth first
search and depth first search

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5411-2
00:25:56.654 --> 00:25:58.319
the name has the word search.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5414-0
00:25:58.329 --> 00:25:59.399
But don't get confused.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5432-0
00:25:59.409 --> 00:26:02.276
It is just a traversal
technique, but it is not just a

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5432-1
00:26:02.276 --> 00:26:03.319
traversal technique.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5450-0
00:26:03.329 --> 00:26:06.841
It can be used for many other
applications also, yeah, but

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5450-1
00:26:06.841 --> 00:26:08.389
what exactly is traversal?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5461-0
00:26:09.119 --> 00:26:12.596
Traversal is nothing but walking
through our data structure

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5461-1
00:26:12.596 --> 00:26:13.349
exactly once.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5479-0
00:26:13.419 --> 00:26:16.989
Yeah, if there's an array you go
about printing all the elements.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5484-0
00:26:17.119 --> 00:26:17.969
That is traversal.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5489-0
00:26:18.299 --> 00:26:19.269
You have a queue.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5494-0
00:26:19.459 --> 00:26:20.869
You go from friend to last.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5508-0
00:26:21.019 --> 00:26:23.969
Yeah, that is nothing but a
traversal and so on.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5514-0
00:26:24.729 --> 00:26:26.519
So what exactly is BFS now?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5527-0
00:26:26.529 --> 00:26:28.519
So we'll look at both of them
complexity wise.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5550-0
00:26:28.529 --> 00:26:31.423
Both of them are the same, but
these two are two techniques

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5550-1
00:26:31.423 --> 00:26:33.159
similar to your preorder
postorder.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5564-0
00:26:33.169 --> 00:26:36.479
In order, all of them have the
same complexity, but they're

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5564-1
00:26:36.479 --> 00:26:37.969
philosophies are different.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5569-0
00:26:38.069 --> 00:26:38.659
They need in order.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5577-0
00:26:38.669 --> 00:26:39.919
You did something in preorder.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5583-0
00:26:39.929 --> 00:26:41.319
You did something right.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5598-0
00:26:41.449 --> 00:26:44.733
Similarly, these two are the
same complexity, but their

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5598-1
00:26:44.733 --> 00:26:46.199
ideologies are different.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5603-0
00:26:46.659 --> 00:26:47.859
So let's look at BFS.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5623-0
00:26:47.869 --> 00:26:51.865
First, Bradford search is a
general technique for traversing

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5623-1
00:26:51.865 --> 00:26:52.389
a graph.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5642-0
00:26:53.399 --> 00:26:56.977
BFS traversal of a graph G
visits all the vertices and

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5642-1
00:26:56.977 --> 00:26:59.969
edges of G determines whether G
is connected.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5644-0
00:27:00.059 --> 00:27:00.529
Correct.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5655-0
00:27:00.779 --> 00:27:03.405
Because if there is a graph
which is say something like

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5655-1
00:27:03.405 --> 00:27:03.639
this.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5666-0
00:27:06.179 --> 00:27:07.779
Yeah, you start with this node.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5676-0
00:27:08.459 --> 00:27:09.589
You go visit the visit.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5683-0
00:27:09.599 --> 00:27:10.709
There's there's all this.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5699-0
00:27:10.779 --> 00:27:13.763
You've completed it, but even
now there is a node which has

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5699-1
00:27:13.763 --> 00:27:14.609
not been visited.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5706-0
00:27:14.699 --> 00:27:15.589
So what does that mean?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5733-0
00:27:15.919 --> 00:27:19.753
That means that this graph is
disconnected, so it determines

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5733-1
00:27:19.753 --> 00:27:23.713
whether G is connected or not,
and then computes the connected

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5733-2
00:27:23.713 --> 00:27:24.719
components of G.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5753-0
00:27:24.809 --> 00:27:27.349
So whatever you had traversed,
that is nothing but the

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5753-1
00:27:27.349 --> 00:27:28.319
connected components.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5765-0
00:27:28.599 --> 00:27:31.004
Whatever you are not able to
reach, those are the

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5765-1
00:27:31.004 --> 00:27:32.159
disconnected components.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5771-0
00:27:32.569 --> 00:27:34.489
Computes a spanning forest of.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5779-0
00:27:34.839 --> 00:27:36.299
Yeah, this is for you to
explore.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5792-0
00:27:36.539 --> 00:27:39.019
There is no good explanation on
this in your text.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5819-0
00:27:39.349 --> 00:27:43.976
Explain about other tests so BF
is on a graph with N vertices

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5819-1
00:27:43.976 --> 00:27:47.409
and M edges because they may not
be the same.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5837-0
00:27:47.459 --> 00:27:49.749
Right edges can be more or edges
can be less.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5844-0
00:27:50.059 --> 00:27:53.729
So overall the complexity will
be big off n + m time.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5854-0
00:27:54.239 --> 00:27:54.409
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5861-0
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:59.559
And BFS can be further extended
to solve other graph problems.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5908-0
00:27:59.729 --> 00:28:03.073
Yeah, this is a normal technique
just to go ahead and traverse

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5908-1
00:28:03.073 --> 00:28:06.045
the graph, but just by doing
that or just tweaking it a

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5908-2
00:28:06.045 --> 00:28:09.388
little, yeah, by adding some one
or two lines of extra code we

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5908-3
00:28:09.388 --> 00:28:11.299
will be able to do something
extra.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5937-0
00:28:11.539 --> 00:28:16.155
What is that we can find and
report a path with the minimum

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5937-1
00:28:16.155 --> 00:28:20.309
number of edges between 2
vertices in that big graph.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5943-0
00:28:20.359 --> 00:28:21.429
I give you 2 nodes.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5960-0
00:28:21.639 --> 00:28:24.883
I tell you from these two nodes
what is the minimum number of

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5960-1
00:28:24.883 --> 00:28:25.929
edges to reach them?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5970-0
00:28:26.479 --> 00:28:28.269
Yeah, BFS will be able to do
that.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5975-0
00:28:29.219 --> 00:28:29.729
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5982-0
00:28:30.119 --> 00:28:32.169
Find a simple cycle if there is
one.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5984-0
00:28:32.299 --> 00:28:32.509
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5988-0
00:28:32.519 --> 00:28:32.769
Cycle.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/5998-0
00:28:32.779 --> 00:28:34.609
You guys know you start from a
node.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6010-0
00:28:34.659 --> 00:28:36.899
You go all the way around and
come back to that node.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6043-0
00:28:36.909 --> 00:28:40.563
That is a cycle, so if there is
a cycle, BFS will also be able

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6043-1
00:28:40.563 --> 00:28:44.333
to detect that it'll be able to
tell you so a lot more things it

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6043-2
00:28:44.333 --> 00:28:44.739
can do.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6087-0
00:28:44.749 --> 00:28:48.205
Yeah, I'll leave it to you to
explore all that, but we will

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6087-1
00:28:48.205 --> 00:28:51.200
just look at the BFS actual
traversal and all these

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6087-2
00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:54.311
applications are clearly given
in the text, even with

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6087-3
00:28:54.311 --> 00:28:56.269
explanation and the pseudo
codes.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6095-0
00:28:58.069 --> 00:28:58.999
Now, how do we do that?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6097-0
00:28:59.109 --> 00:28:59.299
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6108-0
00:28:59.309 --> 00:29:01.459
How do we do this BFS right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6114-0
00:29:02.829 --> 00:29:07.419
So BFS is typically known as
breakfast.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6124-0
00:29:07.729 --> 00:29:09.559
So what we do is we use a queue.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6152-0
00:29:09.949 --> 00:29:13.874
Yeah, it is very common to use a
queue to keep track of the nodes

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6152-1
00:29:13.874 --> 00:29:17.263
to be visited next, and the
nodes that have been already

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6152-2
00:29:17.263 --> 00:29:17.739
visited.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6159-0
00:29:18.249 --> 00:29:20.079
Yeah, because it's a graph,
right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6217-0
00:29:20.089 --> 00:29:23.988
There are many nodes there, so
we will use a queue to keep

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6217-1
00:29:23.988 --> 00:29:28.152
track of wall have been already
visited and who all are yet to

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6217-2
00:29:28.152 --> 00:29:32.448
be visited and typically use of
a queue leads to a breadth first

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6217-3
00:29:32.448 --> 00:29:36.678
visit order, breadth first visit
order is cautious that is very

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6217-4
00:29:36.678 --> 00:29:37.339
important.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6244-0
00:29:37.929 --> 00:29:42.062
It is very cautious in the sense
that it examines every path of

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6244-1
00:29:42.062 --> 00:29:45.679
length I before going to all the
paths of length I + 1.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6248-0
00:29:46.709 --> 00:29:47.039
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6266-0
00:29:47.049 --> 00:29:50.809
We will see about DFS also, but
in DFS it is more cautious.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6270-0
00:29:51.089 --> 00:29:52.459
It's very vigilant.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6281-0
00:29:52.469 --> 00:29:54.999
It doesn't go deep into a node
and so on.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6342-0
00:29:55.489 --> 00:29:59.625
It examines all the length I and
then goes to the next level I +

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6342-1
00:29:59.625 --> 00:30:03.570
1, and so on, and in this whole
ecosystem, once you draw this

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6342-2
00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:07.515
BFS, you will have something
called as a dotted line which is

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6342-3
00:30:07.515 --> 00:30:11.396
called Cross Edge and there is
something called a solid line

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6342-4
00:30:11.396 --> 00:30:13.369
which is called Discovery Edge.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6358-0
00:30:13.659 --> 00:30:15.949
We will draw that and at that
time it will be one more clear.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6362-0
00:30:16.969 --> 00:30:17.109
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6373-0
00:30:18.689 --> 00:30:21.509
Well, let's look at this all of
you.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6391-0
00:30:21.519 --> 00:30:24.962
I want you to focus 200% because
this is the only slide I have

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6391-1
00:30:24.962 --> 00:30:25.399
for BFS.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6398-0
00:30:25.409 --> 00:30:26.709
There's a lot of animations.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6407-0
00:30:26.919 --> 00:30:29.319
I'll repeat this, but just
listen to me.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6410-0
00:30:29.659 --> 00:30:29.809
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6422-0
00:30:30.999 --> 00:30:33.949
First things first, there will
be a question in your mind.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6430-0
00:30:34.209 --> 00:30:36.449
Can I have multiple output for
BFS?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6434-0
00:30:37.209 --> 00:30:37.379
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6437-0
00:30:37.389 --> 00:30:38.039
What do you think?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6446-0
00:30:38.549 --> 00:30:39.819
A graph like this is given to
you.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6455-0
00:30:40.639 --> 00:30:42.689
Yeah, it is an undirected graph
here.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6463-0
00:30:42.959 --> 00:30:45.649
Can there be multiple answers
for BFS?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6466-0
00:30:45.659 --> 00:30:47.619
Yes, right.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6484-0
00:30:47.689 --> 00:30:50.843
So when says yes and that's
correct, because BFS itself

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6484-1
00:30:50.843 --> 00:30:52.139
simply means traversal.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6501-0
00:30:52.629 --> 00:30:55.351
Yeah, maybe similar starts from
one sheet, traverses the whole

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6501-1
00:30:55.351 --> 00:30:55.999
graph with one.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6507-0
00:30:56.249 --> 00:30:58.419
Maybe Krishna starts from 5
right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6517-0
00:30:58.809 --> 00:31:00.949
Or, you know, PATHAK starts from
8, right.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6529-0
00:31:00.959 --> 00:31:03.299
So it depends on where you
start, how you go.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6547-0
00:31:03.869 --> 00:31:07.539
Ultimately, you'll have to visit
all of them that are possible,

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6547-1
00:31:07.539 --> 00:31:09.489
so the outputs will be
different.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6553-0
00:31:11.049 --> 00:31:11.329
OK.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6566-0
00:31:11.339 --> 00:31:15.059
That being said, then how do we
maintain consistency, if at all?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6573-0
00:31:15.069 --> 00:31:16.309
Such a question comes in exam.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6583-0
00:31:16.319 --> 00:31:17.649
You will all take your own
notes.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6597-0
00:31:17.659 --> 00:31:20.159
You'll do your own traversals,
but how do we evaluate it?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6599-0
00:31:20.649 --> 00:31:21.059
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6607-0
00:31:21.139 --> 00:31:23.139
So there is an unsaid
convention.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6612-0
00:31:23.149 --> 00:31:23.959
Yeah, there is a.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6619-0
00:31:24.109 --> 00:31:25.839
That is a convention, not a
rule, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6636-0
00:31:25.849 --> 00:31:29.996
It is that we will always follow
numerical or alphabetical

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6636-1
00:31:29.996 --> 00:31:30.629
ordering.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6660-0
00:31:31.869 --> 00:31:34.617
Meaning, if there is a graph
given to us which is having

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6660-1
00:31:34.617 --> 00:31:37.510
numbers then we will always
start with one or zero whatever

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6660-2
00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:37.799
right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6673-0
00:31:37.809 --> 00:31:41.009
We will start with that and go
proceed with the graph.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6691-0
00:31:41.219 --> 00:31:44.484
If it is with numericals or I
mean alphabets, you will start

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6691-1
00:31:44.484 --> 00:31:44.859
with a.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6699-0
00:31:46.259 --> 00:31:47.339
He's that clear for all of you.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6706-0
00:31:48.509 --> 00:31:49.399
This is not a rule.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6709-0
00:31:49.409 --> 00:31:49.789
And so on.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6719-0
00:31:49.799 --> 00:31:51.059
Yeah, you can start with any
node.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6750-0
00:31:51.069 --> 00:31:54.817
You will get your own output,
but just to stay consistent most

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6750-1
00:31:54.817 --> 00:31:58.447
of the time what we will do is
we will use ordering right in

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6750-2
00:31:58.447 --> 00:31:59.399
this graph Amit.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6754-0
00:31:59.409 --> 00:32:00.319
We will start with one.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6766-0
00:32:00.509 --> 00:32:02.379
We will start the whole
traversal with one.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6783-0
00:32:02.769 --> 00:32:06.366
If there is a graph with ABCD
and so on, you will start with a

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6783-1
00:32:06.366 --> 00:32:06.709
right.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6803-0
00:32:06.719 --> 00:32:09.277
You will not start with some
other random nodes because that

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6803-1
00:32:09.277 --> 00:32:11.039
will give you an answer which is
correct.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6832-0
00:32:11.259 --> 00:32:14.950
But to maintain consistency, we
will always start with one, and

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6832-1
00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:18.180
if there's a graph with ABCD,
we'll start with a in the

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6832-2
00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:18.699
question.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6841-0
00:32:18.709 --> 00:32:20.219
Also, it will be clearly given
to you.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6862-0
00:32:20.279 --> 00:32:23.064
Yeah, in many times it will be
given like, you know, start with

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6862-1
00:32:23.064 --> 00:32:23.499
this node.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6883-0
00:32:23.589 --> 00:32:26.331
Then you'll have to start with
that, or it'll be told that

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6883-1
00:32:26.331 --> 00:32:27.679
follow alphabetical ordering.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6894-0
00:32:27.789 --> 00:32:30.069
Then you should start with a
well.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6905-0
00:32:31.709 --> 00:32:34.979
So in this graph this is again
BFS and DFS.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6927-0
00:32:34.989 --> 00:32:39.028
Both are traversal techniques,
so it can be applicable to both

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6927-1
00:32:39.028 --> 00:32:41.529
directed and undirected graphs,
right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6936-0
00:32:41.539 --> 00:32:43.289
We will take example of
undirected.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6942-0
00:32:43.299 --> 00:32:45.379
Here, directed also is exactly
the same.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6949-0
00:32:46.859 --> 00:32:47.639
We'll start with one.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6956-0
00:32:48.819 --> 00:32:50.589
Just see the steps that I'm
doing.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6959-0
00:32:50.659 --> 00:32:50.779
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6974-0
00:32:52.119 --> 00:32:55.909
And Mark it in a different
color, meaning I'm now in one.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6982-0
00:32:56.009 --> 00:32:57.239
Yeah, I have now reached one.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6992-0
00:32:59.159 --> 00:33:00.969
I'll enqueue him into the queue.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/6998-0
00:33:01.359 --> 00:33:02.319
I'll put him in the output.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7004-0
00:33:03.619 --> 00:33:04.279
What all did I do?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7014-0
00:33:05.959 --> 00:33:07.649
Yeah, let's take it slow and
simple.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7024-0
00:33:07.719 --> 00:33:09.929
But once you get a hang of it,
it's very simple.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7036-0
00:33:09.939 --> 00:33:12.649
Yeah, I first landed in a note.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7043-0
00:33:13.219 --> 00:33:14.349
I changed this color.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7050-0
00:33:14.979 --> 00:33:17.789
I enqueued him into my queue,
right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7059-0
00:33:17.849 --> 00:33:19.089
I also put him in my output.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7067-0
00:33:19.909 --> 00:33:21.019
That is all I have done so far.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7075-0
00:33:22.529 --> 00:33:23.619
Now, who is there in my queue?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7084-0
00:33:24.879 --> 00:33:25.929
One is they didn't make you.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7092-0
00:33:26.379 --> 00:33:28.609
And what is the front of the
queue?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7094-0
00:33:30.659 --> 00:33:30.839
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7117-0
00:33:33.289 --> 00:33:37.590
Before concept in a queue there
is friend there is last year one

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7117-1
00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:39.509
is the friend, so remove him.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7127-0
00:33:40.359 --> 00:33:41.849
Remove the front of the queue.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7137-0
00:33:41.859 --> 00:33:45.339
Whoever is there in the front,
remove him and explore him.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7142-0
00:33:46.109 --> 00:33:46.859
We explore.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7151-0
00:33:46.869 --> 00:33:49.729
I mean, look at who all are
connected to it.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7156-0
00:33:50.509 --> 00:33:51.339
Alright, let's do that.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7160-0
00:33:51.769 --> 00:33:52.739
Remove that one.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7179-0
00:33:53.029 --> 00:33:56.973
See who all are adjacent to one
that was called as exploring

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7179-1
00:33:56.973 --> 00:33:58.589
that node, exploring one.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7189-0
00:33:58.879 --> 00:34:00.209
So who all are adjacent to one?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7191-0
00:34:01.299 --> 00:34:01.789
You will tell me?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7196-0
00:34:04.029 --> 00:34:04.599
To entry.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7200-0
00:34:04.649 --> 00:34:05.139
Very good.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7208-0
00:34:05.469 --> 00:34:06.699
So two and three are there.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7221-0
00:34:06.889 --> 00:34:10.039
So again, numerical ordering,
you should not do 3/2.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7269-0
00:34:10.349 --> 00:34:14.191
That's not wrong, but you will
mention it as two comma three

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7269-1
00:34:14.191 --> 00:34:17.971
change their colors, add them
into the queue, add them into

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7269-2
00:34:17.971 --> 00:34:21.561
the output and this arrow
doesn't mean I'm converting an

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7269-3
00:34:21.561 --> 00:34:24.459
undirected graph to directed
graph and so on.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7286-0
00:34:24.889 --> 00:34:28.999
It simply indicates that I have
come to two from one.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7292-0
00:34:29.519 --> 00:34:30.859
I've come to three from one.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7301-0
00:34:31.579 --> 00:34:33.349
Yeah, a lot of authors don't do
that.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7317-0
00:34:33.419 --> 00:34:36.603
You can just put a normal
without arrow also and that is

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7317-1
00:34:36.603 --> 00:34:37.329
also correct.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7325-0
00:34:37.559 --> 00:34:38.949
Yeah, this is not meaning.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7336-0
00:34:38.959 --> 00:34:40.839
I'm converting it into directed
and so on.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7352-0
00:34:41.519 --> 00:34:44.920
It simply means when I'm
visiting the notes from where

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7352-1
00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:45.909
did I come from?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7362-0
00:34:45.919 --> 00:34:47.569
One I came to two from one.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7366-0
00:34:47.579 --> 00:34:48.289
I came to three.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7371-0
00:34:48.339 --> 00:34:49.309
That is what it means.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7377-0
00:34:49.879 --> 00:34:51.939
Yeah, so far, so good.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7395-0
00:34:51.949 --> 00:34:57.299
What we did, we visited a node
or we landed in a node, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7403-0
00:34:57.709 --> 00:34:59.389
We changed his color.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7434-0
00:35:00.279 --> 00:35:04.317
We added him into the queue and
we added him into the output and

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7434-1
00:35:04.317 --> 00:35:07.609
in this whole output was two and
three there before.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7471-0
00:35:07.899 --> 00:35:11.885
So in this state, there's only
one, and now 2-3 have come for

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7471-1
00:35:11.885 --> 00:35:15.871
the first time, meaning for the
very first time I saw two and

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7471-2
00:35:15.871 --> 00:35:18.829
three, so that is called as a
discovery edge.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7493-0
00:35:19.149 --> 00:35:23.198
So very for the first time I'm
discovering 2 and three, so

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7493-1
00:35:23.198 --> 00:35:25.119
these edges are solid lines.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7497-0
00:35:25.479 --> 00:35:27.449
Solid line means discovery edge.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7500-0
00:35:29.139 --> 00:35:29.529
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7511-0
00:35:29.579 --> 00:35:31.189
And I've also put these two in
the queue.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7525-0
00:35:31.539 --> 00:35:33.039
So now who is in the front of
queue?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7529-0
00:35:34.559 --> 00:35:35.449
Two and three are there.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7537-0
00:35:35.459 --> 00:35:36.819
So who is in the front of queue?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7543-0
00:35:39.339 --> 00:35:41.209
Yeah, always.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7548-0
00:35:41.219 --> 00:35:43.459
This part is the friend, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7563-0
00:35:43.529 --> 00:35:47.779
So two is there in the front and
here you have the last right.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7582-0
00:35:48.819 --> 00:35:52.968
So now I will have to explore
two meaning just carefully look

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7582-1
00:35:52.968 --> 00:35:53.369
at it.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7599-0
00:35:53.419 --> 00:35:56.432
I deleted that too and I'm
exploring him, meaning I'll see

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7599-1
00:35:56.432 --> 00:35:57.709
who all are connected to.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7601-0
00:35:57.719 --> 00:35:58.009
Two.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7608-0
00:35:58.379 --> 00:35:59.329
Who all are connected to two?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7611-0
00:36:01.189 --> 00:36:01.889
Yeah, real quick.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7620-0
00:36:04.059 --> 00:36:06.349
Waller, adjacent to two very
careful.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7627-0
00:36:06.359 --> 00:36:07.369
Yeah, Simran is right.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7635-0
00:36:07.979 --> 00:36:09.379
All of them which are connected.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7642-0
00:36:09.389 --> 00:36:10.589
You should have a close look.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7646-0
00:36:10.959 --> 00:36:12.109
One is also connected.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7652-0
00:36:12.179 --> 00:36:13.349
Three is also connected.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7657-0
00:36:13.439 --> 00:36:14.589
Four is also connected.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7661-0
00:36:14.599 --> 00:36:15.429
Five is also connected.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7680-0
00:36:15.439 --> 00:36:18.442
You see this line for right from
two there are four nodes that

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7680-1
00:36:18.442 --> 00:36:19.109
are connected.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7708-0
00:36:20.829 --> 00:36:25.245
No one is already there in my
output and from one to two there

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7708-1
00:36:25.245 --> 00:36:28.679
is already a discovery edge
also, so do nothing.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7733-0
00:36:30.799 --> 00:36:34.232
Three is also already there in
the output, but between two and

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7733-1
00:36:34.232 --> 00:36:36.249
three there is no edge in my
output.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7740-0
00:36:36.779 --> 00:36:37.739
So what should I be drawing?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7762-0
00:36:38.749 --> 00:36:42.589
So Amay visiting 3 for the first
time or is 3 already there in

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7762-1
00:36:42.589 --> 00:36:43.259
the output?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7769-0
00:36:44.539 --> 00:36:45.809
Please already there in the
output.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7794-0
00:36:46.299 --> 00:36:49.778
I know about the existence of
three when I was at one itself

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7794-1
00:36:49.778 --> 00:36:53.029
right from one, I already
detected that three was there.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7815-0
00:36:53.929 --> 00:36:57.615
So from two to three, should I
be putting a solid line or

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7815-1
00:36:57.615 --> 00:36:59.839
should I be putting a dotted
line?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7825-0
00:37:02.829 --> 00:37:04.109
Dotted solid.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7823-0
00:37:03.949 --> 00:37:04.609
Yeah, exactly.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7838-0
00:37:05.449 --> 00:37:08.931
No, not solid because three is
already there in the output,

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7838-1
00:37:08.931 --> 00:37:09.279
right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7857-0
00:37:09.529 --> 00:37:12.510
So when there is something
already there in the output, you

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7857-1
00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:14.199
will not be putting a solid
line.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7873-0
00:37:14.349 --> 00:37:17.088
You will put a dotted line,
meaning it is already there in

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7873-1
00:37:17.088 --> 00:37:17.599
the output.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7883-0
00:37:17.609 --> 00:37:19.439
I'm not discovering him for the
first time.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7894-0
00:37:19.889 --> 00:37:22.679
He's extra there, but what about
four and five?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7923-0
00:37:23.679 --> 00:37:27.465
Four and five are not even there
in the output I am discovering

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7923-1
00:37:27.465 --> 00:37:30.659
them for the first time via this
to only from 2 only.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7946-0
00:37:30.669 --> 00:37:33.335
I got to know the two is
connected to some node called 4

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7946-1
00:37:33.335 --> 00:37:35.159
from 2 there is something called
file.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7953-0
00:37:35.609 --> 00:37:37.589
So for them I will have a solid
line.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7966-0
00:37:39.259 --> 00:37:41.449
Firstly 4 and five I added into
the queue.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/7980-0
00:37:41.459 --> 00:37:43.559
I changed their color, I put
them in the output.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8008-0
00:37:44.519 --> 00:37:47.646
So as we discussed from two to
four two to five, it is a solid

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8008-1
00:37:47.646 --> 00:37:50.029
line but from two to three it is
a dotted line.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8011-0
00:37:50.909 --> 00:37:51.679
So far so good.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8018-0
00:37:51.689 --> 00:37:52.719
What is the next step?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8023-0
00:37:53.109 --> 00:37:54.519
Who will be explore next?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8032-0
00:37:56.719 --> 00:37:57.019
4.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8029-0
00:37:56.729 --> 00:37:57.099
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8035-0
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.349
Is it?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8039-0
00:37:57.409 --> 00:37:57.759
Be.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8041-0
00:37:59.049 --> 00:37:59.799
Look at the queue.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8050-0
00:37:59.839 --> 00:38:02.279
Yeah, we should not have random
answers.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8063-0
00:38:02.289 --> 00:38:04.899
We should follow the same step
in that queue.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8079-0
00:38:04.959 --> 00:38:08.096
We have been exploring from the
front so one got explored, then

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8070-0
00:38:05.619 --> 00:38:05.789
We.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8079-1
00:38:08.096 --> 00:38:08.929
two got explored.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8081-0
00:38:08.339 --> 00:38:08.709
Pay.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8091-0
00:38:08.939 --> 00:38:11.549
Now 3, right, we will remove the
three.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8096-0
00:38:11.559 --> 00:38:12.889
Now I removed it.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8101-0
00:38:13.219 --> 00:38:14.849
I'll ask myself the same
question.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8103-0
00:38:14.859 --> 00:38:15.119
Who?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8116-0
00:38:15.129 --> 00:38:18.449
All our adjacent to three I
should list down.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8125-0
00:38:18.519 --> 00:38:19.989
All of them adjacent to three.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8134-0
00:38:20.039 --> 00:38:20.389
Who are they?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8150-0
00:38:21.769 --> 00:38:29.227
12578 out of that this is 125
are already there in my output,

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8150-1
00:38:29.227 --> 00:38:29.949
right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8163-0
00:38:30.279 --> 00:38:33.529
But seven and eight are not
there, so seven and eight.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8168-0
00:38:33.539 --> 00:38:34.759
I should change their color.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8175-0
00:38:34.999 --> 00:38:36.309
I should enqueue them here.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8208-0
00:38:36.719 --> 00:38:40.209
I should also put them in the
output, but let's explore the

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8208-1
00:38:40.209 --> 00:38:43.699
other part and what type of
edges will it have from 3:00 to

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8208-2
00:38:43.699 --> 00:38:44.979
7:00 and 3:00 to 8:00.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8239-0
00:38:45.309 --> 00:38:48.892
Will it be a dotted line or will
it be a solid line because seven

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8239-1
00:38:48.892 --> 00:38:52.258
and eight are not even there in
the output for the very first

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8239-2
00:38:52.258 --> 00:38:52.529
time?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8243-0
00:38:52.539 --> 00:38:53.249
I'm looking at it.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8250-0
00:38:53.579 --> 00:38:55.929
I'm discovering them from three.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8258-0
00:38:56.259 --> 00:38:57.339
It should be a solid line.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8257-0
00:38:57.309 --> 00:38:57.579
I didn't.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8262-0
00:38:58.869 --> 00:38:59.599
Perfect.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8267-0
00:38:59.749 --> 00:39:00.839
But what about the others?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8286-0
00:39:01.309 --> 00:39:05.989
SO12 and five were already there
in the output from one to three.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8292-0
00:39:06.339 --> 00:39:08.119
There is already a solid line
here.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8305-0
00:39:08.129 --> 00:39:10.949
Solid edge here, so do nothing
from two to three.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8339-0
00:39:10.959 --> 00:39:13.859
Also, there is already a cross
edge or dotted line, so do

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8339-1
00:39:13.859 --> 00:39:17.059
nothing but from three to five
there is nothing right, but five

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8339-2
00:39:17.059 --> 00:39:18.609
is already there in the output.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8345-0
00:39:18.619 --> 00:39:19.669
So what edge will it be?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8354-0
00:39:19.979 --> 00:39:22.059
It will be a dotted 1, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8361-0
00:39:22.879 --> 00:39:23.589
See the output now.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8378-0
00:39:24.959 --> 00:39:27.660
So what we have done now you
have changed seven and eight

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8378-1
00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:27.939
color.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8385-0
00:39:28.259 --> 00:39:29.909
We have added them into the
queue.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8401-0
00:39:30.079 --> 00:39:33.229
We have added them in the output
from 3 to 7328.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8414-0
00:39:33.239 --> 00:39:35.549
It was a solid line from three
to five.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8432-0
00:39:35.559 --> 00:39:39.257
It was a dotted line because
five was already there in the

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8432-1
00:39:39.257 --> 00:39:40.699
output via 2 right now.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8440-0
00:39:40.709 --> 00:39:42.019
Who's the friend of the queue?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8451-0
00:39:42.079 --> 00:39:44.369
He's 4, so I'll explore four.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8461-0
00:39:43.869 --> 00:39:47.679
One question, sorry three to
one.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8459-0
00:39:45.549 --> 00:39:46.049
Yeah, go ahead.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8468-0
00:39:47.689 --> 00:39:48.799
It's like a unit.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8488-0
00:39:48.809 --> 00:39:51.795
I mean, it's a it mentioned as a
unidirectional right, but it's a

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8488-1
00:39:51.795 --> 00:39:52.429
bidirectional.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8512-0
00:39:52.439 --> 00:39:54.539
So don't do mention a dotted
line for 3/2.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8551-0
00:39:52.949 --> 00:39:57.356
No, that is what again and again
I'm repeating the arrow doesn't

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8551-1
00:39:57.356 --> 00:40:01.559
here mean that I'm converting
that graph to a directed graph,

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8551-2
00:40:01.559 --> 00:40:05.559
it just indicates I came from
one to three or I detected 3

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8551-3
00:40:05.559 --> 00:40:06.779
when I was at one.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8558-0
00:40:06.869 --> 00:40:07.779
That was all it means.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8571-0
00:40:07.949 --> 00:40:10.459
If this is failing, confusing,
don't use the arrows.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8577-0
00:40:10.469 --> 00:40:12.669
Just put solid lines here, yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8579-0
00:40:13.449 --> 00:40:13.599
But.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8615-0
00:40:14.529 --> 00:40:17.991
Well, so whenever you see
something which is already there

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8615-1
00:40:17.991 --> 00:40:21.276
in the output and with the
exploring node, if you don't

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8615-2
00:40:21.276 --> 00:40:24.679
have any connection then it will
be a dotted line. Right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8621-0
00:40:25.139 --> 00:40:25.369
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8640-0
00:40:25.379 --> 00:40:27.729
Amit from 3 to one there is no
dotted because there is already

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8640-1
00:40:27.729 --> 00:40:28.549
a line existing there.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8650-0
00:40:28.639 --> 00:40:31.109
If there is already a edge
between them, don't do anything.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8685-0
00:40:31.259 --> 00:40:34.541
Don't add extra dotted lines or
you know things like that or

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8685-1
00:40:34.541 --> 00:40:37.770
another tip for you in this
final output, there will not be

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8685-2
00:40:37.770 --> 00:40:39.169
any parallel edges, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8699-0
00:40:39.179 --> 00:40:42.129
Every two nodes will have only
either a solid or across.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8705-0
00:40:42.599 --> 00:40:43.879
You should not have multiple
lines.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8708-0
00:40:45.699 --> 00:40:45.889
Who?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8713-0
00:40:45.899 --> 00:40:46.869
Let's finish this problem.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8718-0
00:40:46.879 --> 00:40:47.709
We'll come back again.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8728-0
00:40:47.959 --> 00:40:50.109
So now the front is 4, so
explore him.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8732-0
00:40:50.159 --> 00:40:50.789
Delete him.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8735-0
00:40:51.199 --> 00:40:52.169
I deleted him.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8743-0
00:40:52.279 --> 00:40:54.459
Explore 4 exploring.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8765-0
00:40:54.469 --> 00:40:57.541
I mean, who all are connected to
four, so two and five are

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8765-1
00:40:57.541 --> 00:40:58.739
connected two and five.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8775-0
00:40:58.749 --> 00:40:59.959
Both are there in my output.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8795-0
00:41:00.369 --> 00:41:03.667
Right, there is nothing new and
from two to four or four to two,

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8795-1
00:41:03.667 --> 00:41:05.899
there is already some edge also
solid edge.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8803-0
00:41:05.909 --> 00:41:07.999
So do nothing from four to five.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8811-0
00:41:08.009 --> 00:41:09.339
What type of edge should I put?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8817-0
00:41:09.589 --> 00:41:10.599
Will it be dotted or solid?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8819-0
00:41:12.789 --> 00:41:12.909
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8827-0
00:41:15.889 --> 00:41:17.009
Real quick, very good.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8830-0
00:41:17.499 --> 00:41:18.169
That's it.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8850-0
00:41:18.279 --> 00:41:22.985
I did not explore anyone newly
so I could not add anything to

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8850-1
00:41:22.985 --> 00:41:24.199
the queue of it.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8865-0
00:41:24.269 --> 00:41:26.139
Now, who is the next note in the
queue?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8870-0
00:41:26.509 --> 00:41:26.979
These five.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8877-0
00:41:27.469 --> 00:41:31.319
So delete five and explore him.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8917-0
00:41:31.549 --> 00:41:34.351
By exploring I mean who all are
connected to five all are

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8917-1
00:41:34.351 --> 00:41:37.105
connected, two is connected,
three is connected, four is

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8917-2
00:41:37.105 --> 00:41:40.053
connected, six is connected, but
234 all of them are already

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8917-3
00:41:40.053 --> 00:41:41.019
there in the output.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8927-0
00:41:41.489 --> 00:41:44.019
But just check from five to
three.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8937-0
00:41:44.289 --> 00:41:47.479
There is already some cross edge
from 5 to 2.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8951-0
00:41:47.529 --> 00:41:49.899
There's already edge from four
to five, so there is an edge.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8958-0
00:41:49.909 --> 00:41:51.219
Don't look at directions.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8998-0
00:41:51.329 --> 00:41:55.091
There are already some edges, so
do nothing, but six is not even

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8998-1
00:41:55.091 --> 00:41:58.563
there in the output, so I am
discovering him from the first

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/8998-2
00:41:58.563 --> 00:42:01.399
time, so five to six you will
have a solid line.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9000-0
00:42:03.009 --> 00:42:03.659
You'll put six.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9013-0
00:42:03.669 --> 00:42:05.719
You'll change his color, you
will enqueue him into the queue.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9016-0
00:42:07.659 --> 00:42:08.229
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9024-0
00:42:08.479 --> 00:42:09.529
What is the next step?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9034-0
00:42:09.599 --> 00:42:12.269
Who's there in the front of
queue 7?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9041-0
00:42:13.129 --> 00:42:14.759
Remove him and explore him.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9052-0
00:42:15.209 --> 00:42:18.349
Seven is connected to three and
eight. The innate.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9063-0
00:42:18.359 --> 00:42:20.539
Both are in the output from 7 to
three.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9080-0
00:42:20.549 --> 00:42:24.307
There is already an edge, but
from 7 to 8 there is no edge

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9080-1
00:42:24.307 --> 00:42:24.689
there.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9102-0
00:42:24.949 --> 00:42:29.816
So from 7 to 8 you will put a
dotted ones that what is the

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9102-1
00:42:29.816 --> 00:42:31.549
next step 8 is there.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9109-0
00:42:31.599 --> 00:42:34.959
So remove eight, they might
explore him.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9116-0
00:42:35.029 --> 00:42:36.059
Who all are connected to it?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9123-0
00:42:36.069 --> 00:42:36.699
Seven and three.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9149-0
00:42:36.749 --> 00:42:40.012
Both of them are there in the
output and both of them also

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9149-1
00:42:40.012 --> 00:42:42.059
have some edges to 8, so do
nothing.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9153-0
00:42:42.969 --> 00:42:44.469
Last node 6, remove him.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9157-0
00:42:45.379 --> 00:42:45.989
Explore him.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9172-0
00:42:45.999 --> 00:42:48.189
Six is only connected to five
that is already there in the

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9172-1
00:42:48.189 --> 00:42:48.449
output.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9182-0
00:42:48.509 --> 00:42:50.669
There is also an edge between
them, so do nothing.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9195-0
00:42:51.359 --> 00:42:55.769
So now my queue is empty right
when my queue is empty.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9217-0
00:42:55.969 --> 00:42:59.815
My problem is over and you all
remember in what order we

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9217-1
00:42:59.815 --> 00:43:01.839
removed things from the queue.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9234-0
00:43:02.529 --> 00:43:05.065
He usually one got removed, then
two got removed, then three got

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9234-1
00:43:05.065 --> 00:43:06.509
removed because remember that
order.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9249-0
00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:12.669
12345786 yeah, yeah, of course.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9271-0
00:43:12.679 --> 00:43:17.242
It's before, but that exact
order, right we removed first

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9271-1
00:43:17.242 --> 00:43:19.209
one, then 2345, then 786.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9317-0
00:43:19.679 --> 00:43:24.382
You remember right that is
called the BFS traversal output,

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9317-1
00:43:24.382 --> 00:43:29.319
and this resultant whatever we
got is called as a BFS spanning

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9317-2
00:43:29.319 --> 00:43:34.179
tree, and in that all the dotted
ones are called cross edges,

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9317-3
00:43:34.179 --> 00:43:34.649
right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9326-0
00:43:35.949 --> 00:43:37.599
Is this part clear for all of
you?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9342-0
00:43:37.929 --> 00:43:40.872
There is a very, very
systematic, you know, way to

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9342-1
00:43:40.872 --> 00:43:41.969
solve this problem.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9357-0
00:43:45.309 --> 00:43:47.779
By steps you did right, you
started from a node.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9379-0
00:43:48.269 --> 00:43:51.548
You change this color, you put
him onto the output you added

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9379-1
00:43:51.548 --> 00:43:52.569
him into the queue.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9408-0
00:43:53.349 --> 00:43:57.227
These steps once you add things
to the queues you started

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9408-1
00:43:57.227 --> 00:44:01.039
deleting from the front, you
deleted one node at a time.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9435-0
00:44:01.329 --> 00:44:05.416
Once you deleted him, you asked
yourself who all are connected

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9435-1
00:44:05.416 --> 00:44:09.309
or adjacent to that node and all
those notes you inspected?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9443-0
00:44:09.479 --> 00:44:10.979
Are they there in my output
already?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9453-0
00:44:11.929 --> 00:44:13.639
If it is not there, you will add
it.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9485-0
00:44:13.909 --> 00:44:17.624
You'll also put a solid line or
a discovery edge and you will

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9485-1
00:44:17.624 --> 00:44:21.159
add that into your queue if
those nodes are already there.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9495-0
00:44:21.169 --> 00:44:23.319
In my output, it means that
edges are extra.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9522-0
00:44:23.469 --> 00:44:27.008
You already know those nodes are
there, so you will put a dotted

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9522-1
00:44:27.008 --> 00:44:30.329
line and you will not add them
again and again in the queue.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9526-0
00:44:31.679 --> 00:44:32.069
Correct.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9544-0
00:44:32.079 --> 00:44:34.823
This is a very systematic way to
do, but let's also quickly look

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9544-1
00:44:34.823 --> 00:44:35.709
at your textbook way.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9546-0
00:44:36.179 --> 00:44:36.569
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9563-0
00:44:36.639 --> 00:44:37.629
So there's a graph given.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9570-0
00:44:37.939 --> 00:44:41.495
There are some color devotions,
meaning initially the low color

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9570-1
00:44:41.495 --> 00:44:42.329
and blue color.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9583-0
00:44:42.339 --> 00:44:44.869
You know nodes, these nodes all
are unexploded.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9606-0
00:44:45.479 --> 00:44:48.767
Once I visit someone, I will
change Ms this red color, you

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9606-1
00:44:48.767 --> 00:44:51.776
know background with Violet
initially all of them are

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9606-2
00:44:51.776 --> 00:44:52.389
unexplored.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9627-0
00:44:53.059 --> 00:44:57.157
Once I discover something, I'll
use this red color discovery

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9627-1
00:44:57.157 --> 00:44:58.769
edge dotted 1 red green.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9640-0
00:44:59.999 --> 00:45:02.723
In this graph, Amit will tell me
where will I start the

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9640-1
00:45:02.723 --> 00:45:03.209
traversal.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9647-0
00:45:03.539 --> 00:45:04.319
Nothing is given here.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9657-0
00:45:05.279 --> 00:45:07.859
If there is nothing given, what
is the answered convention?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9666-0
00:45:08.689 --> 00:45:09.739
But where should I start this?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9674-0
00:45:11.989 --> 00:45:13.169
Yeah, I should start from a.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9684-0
00:45:13.989 --> 00:45:14.949
Yeah, I'll start it from me.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9694-0
00:45:16.579 --> 00:45:19.219
I've finished day from a where
will I go?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9720-0
00:45:21.189 --> 00:45:25.951
Yeah, I'm now going to explore a
meaning wall or adjacent to a

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9720-1
00:45:25.951 --> 00:45:28.219
from a I know that B is there.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9731-0
00:45:28.939 --> 00:45:31.829
That is why I've changed it to
discovery from a.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9737-0
00:45:31.839 --> 00:45:32.709
What else do I know?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9743-0
00:45:32.719 --> 00:45:34.029
What else is connected to a?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9750-0
00:45:35.539 --> 00:45:36.629
See is also connected.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9757-0
00:45:37.059 --> 00:45:39.149
D is also connected right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9769-0
00:45:40.629 --> 00:45:45.189
And then will be the next node
to be explored.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9789-0
00:45:45.619 --> 00:45:49.214
In other words, in our example,
deleting him from the queue and

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9789-1
00:45:49.214 --> 00:45:51.349
then seeing wall are connected
to it.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9791-0
00:45:51.359 --> 00:45:51.749
Very good.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9793-0
00:45:51.759 --> 00:45:52.189
B.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9796-0
00:45:52.339 --> 00:45:52.669
Right.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9806-0
00:45:52.679 --> 00:45:55.089
I'll remove B and I'll ask all
are connected to B.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9818-0
00:45:56.799 --> 00:45:58.729
So from B to C it will become
dotted, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9828-0
00:45:58.739 --> 00:46:03.319
Because C is already visited but
BE to E is not visited right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9846-0
00:46:03.559 --> 00:46:08.689
So I'll change B to E discovery,
and then who's the next node?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9867-0
00:46:08.699 --> 00:46:13.362
I'll explore I'll explore C so
when I remove C and I'll explore

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9867-1
00:46:13.362 --> 00:46:15.839
him, see to D will become
dotted.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9878-0
00:46:17.429 --> 00:46:20.249
C to E will become dotted, but
what about C2F?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9884-0
00:46:22.759 --> 00:46:22.879
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9886-0
00:46:24.239 --> 00:46:25.699
C2D became dotted.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9925-0
00:46:27.869 --> 00:46:33.135
C to E became dotted, C2F became
solid, and the next step I will

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9925-1
00:46:33.135 --> 00:46:37.753
remove D then D2F will also
become dotted and that is my

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9925-2
00:46:37.753 --> 00:46:39.049
final traversal.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9958-0
00:46:39.829 --> 00:46:42.688
When I'm removing ENF there will
be nothing right, because

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9958-1
00:46:42.688 --> 00:46:45.499
already both the edges are
either discovery or cross then

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9958-2
00:46:45.499 --> 00:46:48.019
there is no new node that I can
discover from them.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9964-0
00:46:48.789 --> 00:46:49.829
So my traversal is over.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9969-0
00:46:51.749 --> 00:46:52.249
Yeah, go ahead.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9988-0
00:46:54.139 --> 00:46:57.005
This is also the same thing
guys, but it is a different way

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9988-1
00:46:57.005 --> 00:46:57.769
of representing.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/9997-0
00:46:58.019 --> 00:46:58.929
That's pretty much, yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10002-0
00:46:59.709 --> 00:47:01.479
Yeah, I have it out here.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10017-0
00:47:01.569 --> 00:47:04.319
So why do consider a or?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10012-0
00:47:01.919 --> 00:47:02.349
Yeah, go ahead.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10019-0
00:47:04.509 --> 00:47:05.219
Why not B?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10041-0
00:47:05.229 --> 00:47:09.646
Because we don't know what is
level 0 and level one, it can be

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10041-1
00:47:09.646 --> 00:47:11.259
horizontal or vertical.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10082-0
00:47:11.389 --> 00:47:14.519
So can't we consider the height
of a graph and which is having

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10049-0
00:47:11.419 --> 00:47:12.309
Exactly right. Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10082-1
00:47:14.519 --> 00:47:17.648
the maximum height of that node
should be considered as a root

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10082-2
00:47:17.648 --> 00:47:19.089
and then traverse from there?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10090-0
00:47:19.129 --> 00:47:20.659
Yeah, hello.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10098-0
00:47:19.719 --> 00:47:24.979
So in the simple way, there's a
graph have a root, no right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10100-0
00:47:22.889 --> 00:47:23.059
You.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10105-0
00:47:24.639 --> 00:47:25.289
No.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10120-0
00:47:25.069 --> 00:47:28.718
A graph doesn't have a root, so
technically you can start from

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10113-0
00:47:25.399 --> 00:47:26.929
Yeah, yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10120-1
00:47:28.718 --> 00:47:29.239
any node.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10157-0
00:47:29.329 --> 00:47:33.406
You can start the traversal from
EFC Abd anywhere you can start,

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10157-1
00:47:33.406 --> 00:47:37.170
but as I told in the initial
part of this session, it is an

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10148-0
00:47:34.629 --> 00:47:34.949
Umm.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10157-2
00:47:37.170 --> 00:47:38.299
unsaid convention.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10165-0
00:47:38.309 --> 00:47:39.039
It is not a rule.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10188-0
00:47:39.349 --> 00:47:42.119
If you start from B and do the
traversal, nobody will tell it

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10188-1
00:47:42.119 --> 00:47:44.219
is wrong, but you will get a
different answer.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10220-0
00:47:44.229 --> 00:47:47.700
Everyone will get different
different answers based on where

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10220-1
00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:51.398
they start the traversal, so we
have an answered convention that

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10220-2
00:47:51.398 --> 00:47:54.129
always start from alphabetical
ordering, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10238-0
00:47:54.139 --> 00:47:56.089
If it's the graph with ABCD,
start with a.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10236-0
00:47:54.509 --> 00:47:54.769
OK.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10244-0
00:47:56.359 --> 00:47:57.639
If it's with numbers, start with
one.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10246-0
00:47:58.809 --> 00:47:59.119
OK.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10257-0
00:48:00.479 --> 00:48:02.819
Good, but you can also try that.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10259-0
00:48:02.829 --> 00:48:03.019
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10277-0
00:48:03.029 --> 00:48:05.588
If you start from, you will
still get the you know solution

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10277-1
00:48:05.588 --> 00:48:07.209
that is a different traversal
output.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10288-0
00:48:09.899 --> 00:48:12.109
Pull the seudo code of it real
quick.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10294-0
00:48:12.119 --> 00:48:13.489
This is also really simple.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10302-0
00:48:13.559 --> 00:48:14.719
Yeah, initially, what did we do?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10311-0
00:48:15.649 --> 00:48:16.959
We have Q as a queue.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10332-0
00:48:17.229 --> 00:48:19.319
We keep inserting our elements
into that queue.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10324-0
00:48:17.869 --> 00:48:18.689
We have Q.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10337-0
00:48:18.729 --> 00:48:20.189
We keep inserting our message.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10359-0
00:48:20.859 --> 00:48:25.102
Ah, someone is not muted all and
whenever we visit someone, we

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10359-1
00:48:25.102 --> 00:48:28.739
mark it as visited and until
that queue is not empty.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10363-0
00:48:30.899 --> 00:48:31.389
Oops.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10365-0
00:48:31.399 --> 00:48:31.939
Who's that?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10370-0
00:48:32.259 --> 00:48:33.389
I'm still hearing echo.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10377-0
00:48:35.729 --> 00:48:36.899
How can you please mute?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10379-0
00:48:36.959 --> 00:48:37.059
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10400-0
00:48:38.519 --> 00:48:41.556
What we do is we will then try
to dequeue someone and we will

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10400-1
00:48:41.556 --> 00:48:42.879
check his neighbors, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10412-0
00:48:42.889 --> 00:48:45.989
We keep doing that until my
queue becomes empty, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10425-0
00:48:45.999 --> 00:48:50.609
My complexity would be because
we bless E yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10430-0
00:48:50.619 --> 00:48:51.069
Is this clear?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10438-0
00:48:51.079 --> 00:48:53.189
Guys all of you BF first
traversal.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10441-0
00:48:55.339 --> 00:48:55.629
Yes.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10465-0
00:48:55.639 --> 00:49:01.389
No, maybe which approach was
easy this textbook way.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10484-0
00:49:00.479 --> 00:49:03.644
Another quick question, like if
there's a node already in the

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10484-1
00:49:03.644 --> 00:49:06.299
queue, then we'll put the dotted
line simple right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10481-0
00:49:05.959 --> 00:49:07.219
Exactly. Simple.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10495-0
00:49:07.229 --> 00:49:08.159
Yeah, that's right.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10501-0
00:49:07.749 --> 00:49:10.519
So we have to check the queue
again next time.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10539-0
00:49:10.529 --> 00:49:13.205
If we are traversing and then
see if that element already

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10539-1
00:49:13.205 --> 00:49:16.111
there, then put a dotted line
and if there's a line only exist

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10530-0
00:49:14.609 --> 00:49:14.839
Correct.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10539-2
00:49:16.111 --> 00:49:16.849
then do nothing.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10537-0
00:49:16.839 --> 00:49:17.389
No, nothing.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10541-0
00:49:17.479 --> 00:49:18.199
Yeah, exactly.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10554-0
00:49:19.739 --> 00:49:22.649
Non textbook ways easy, it seems
OK yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10564-0
00:49:22.899 --> 00:49:24.609
Anything that you prefer that
should be fine.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10574-0
00:49:24.619 --> 00:49:26.399
Yeah, as long as you understood
it's good.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10607-0
00:49:27.259 --> 00:49:30.552
So as I already told BFS
Applications BFS is just a

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10607-1
00:49:30.552 --> 00:49:34.416
traversal technique, but if you
just add some small lines of

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10607-2
00:49:34.416 --> 00:49:36.949
code to him, he's a powerful
technique.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10619-0
00:49:37.019 --> 00:49:40.469
You will be able to solve other
types of problems also, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10627-0
00:49:40.479 --> 00:49:42.129
So they're all good design
exercises.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10634-0
00:49:42.199 --> 00:49:43.449
Try to do them first.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10643-0
00:49:43.459 --> 00:49:44.929
Try to solve it yourself, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10663-0
00:49:45.239 --> 00:49:49.749
The same BFS, how can I use it
to detect a cycle in my graph?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10690-0
00:49:49.759 --> 00:49:53.490
Try to do that and if you are
not able to then go ahead and

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10690-1
00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:55.729
look at the book right in the
text.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10703-0
00:49:55.739 --> 00:49:58.149
As I told, there is already
clear explanation for all this.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10711-0
00:49:58.439 --> 00:49:59.789
You can go ahead and give it a
shot.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10715-0
00:50:01.369 --> 00:50:03.149
Yeah, pull.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10721-0
00:50:03.559 --> 00:50:04.829
Now let's go to DFS.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10735-0
00:50:06.069 --> 00:50:10.099
Can we do BFS and no, no, you
cannot do all that.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10740-0
00:50:10.109 --> 00:50:10.359
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10745-0
00:50:10.369 --> 00:50:12.789
Lifo is what lethal is.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10749-0
00:50:12.799 --> 00:50:13.439
Which concept?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10756-0
00:50:15.019 --> 00:50:16.419
Last in first out is what.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10788-0
00:50:18.539 --> 00:50:23.597
Last in first out this your
stack you should always use a

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10772-0
00:50:19.789 --> 00:50:21.069
Step talk.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10788-1
00:50:23.597 --> 00:50:26.649
few in order to do your BFS
right.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10802-0
00:50:26.699 --> 00:50:29.079
You should not be using a stack.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10815-0
00:50:29.229 --> 00:50:32.899
If you use a stack, what you
will end up getting is a DFS.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10824-0
00:50:32.989 --> 00:50:33.849
Yeah, that is the next slide.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10830-0
00:50:35.399 --> 00:50:36.239
Yeah, so far, so good.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10836-0
00:50:36.249 --> 00:50:37.069
Let's go to DFS.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10864-0
00:50:41.419 --> 00:50:44.000
Well, again, depth first
traversal is a traversing

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10864-1
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.086
technique and again it can do
all the things that BF is also

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10864-2
00:50:47.086 --> 00:50:47.339
does.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10866-0
00:50:47.449 --> 00:50:47.939
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10885-0
00:50:48.249 --> 00:50:52.509
And the offers on a graph is
again the same complexity.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10900-0
00:50:52.519 --> 00:50:56.152
He can also be used for the same
extended problems, like for

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10900-1
00:50:56.152 --> 00:50:56.629
example.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10919-0
00:50:56.899 --> 00:50:59.794
He can also do you know if
there's a path between 2 there's

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10919-1
00:50:59.794 --> 00:51:01.049
a cycle or not, et cetera.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10921-0
00:51:01.459 --> 00:51:01.589
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10970-0
00:51:02.509 --> 00:51:06.438
So it is very common to use a
stack to keep track of nodes

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10970-1
00:51:06.438 --> 00:51:10.433
visited and nodes that I've
already visited in order to get

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10970-2
00:51:10.433 --> 00:51:14.495
there TFs depth first visit
order is aggressive in the sense

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10970-3
00:51:14.495 --> 00:51:17.159
that it examines complete paths,
right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10977-0
00:51:17.169 --> 00:51:19.479
It is very aggressive in nature.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10983-0
00:51:19.569 --> 00:51:20.459
How was BFS?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10993-0
00:51:22.079 --> 00:51:23.749
You guys remember that word that
we use there?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/10999-0
00:51:24.529 --> 00:51:25.029
My shoes.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11000-0
00:51:25.889 --> 00:51:26.619
Yeah, very good.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11004-0
00:51:26.629 --> 00:51:27.559
It was cautious.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11011-0
00:51:27.789 --> 00:51:29.269
We're very cautious in that
nature.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11024-0
00:51:29.279 --> 00:51:32.079
We don't want to be very
aggressive level by level.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11039-0
00:51:32.509 --> 00:51:36.142
The moment you explore a node,
you see who all are adjacent to

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11039-1
00:51:36.142 --> 00:51:36.719
it, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11051-0
00:51:36.769 --> 00:51:38.739
And consider all of them and so
on.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11060-0
00:51:39.009 --> 00:51:41.039
But here we are going to go very
aggressive.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11065-0
00:51:41.489 --> 00:51:42.849
For example, if you have.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11074-0
00:51:44.299 --> 00:51:46.439
Oops, I will just try to take
this.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11080-0
00:51:48.909 --> 00:51:49.769
In your childhood.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11111-0
00:51:55.229 --> 00:51:58.500
Have you played this type of a
game where there's a food here

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11111-1
00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:01.665
and there is a mouse here and
you need to get him reach the

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11111-2
00:52:01.665 --> 00:52:01.929
foot?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11117-0
00:52:02.849 --> 00:52:03.629
Have you played this game?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11120-0
00:52:05.429 --> 00:52:06.849
The maze game.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11127-0
00:52:08.699 --> 00:52:08.939
Yes.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11143-0
00:52:10.029 --> 00:52:12.737
Yeah, you will start with this
and you will, you know, start

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11143-1
00:52:12.737 --> 00:52:13.359
going somehow.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11160-0
00:52:13.369 --> 00:52:16.345
You know, you keep going
somewhere, you get blocked, and

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11160-1
00:52:16.345 --> 00:52:18.329
when you get blocked, what do
you do?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11167-0
00:52:19.439 --> 00:52:20.429
You come back and see.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11174-0
00:52:20.439 --> 00:52:21.459
OK, I made a mistake here.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11195-0
00:52:21.469 --> 00:52:24.860
Maybe I should have taken this
path and somehow you will keep

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11195-1
00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:26.939
doing that to reach that food,
right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11203-0
00:52:27.169 --> 00:52:28.189
This is called DFS.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11219-0
00:52:29.769 --> 00:52:33.599
You catch hold of 1 path you go
as deep as possible.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11225-0
00:52:33.799 --> 00:52:35.239
Somewhere you know that you are
stuck.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11242-0
00:52:35.249 --> 00:52:38.175
You cannot go any further then
you take a step back and take

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11242-1
00:52:38.175 --> 00:52:38.799
another path.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11251-0
00:52:39.979 --> 00:52:41.249
Annoyingly, you learned DFS.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11260-0
00:52:42.099 --> 00:52:43.549
Yeah, this is what is DFS.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11275-0
00:52:43.779 --> 00:52:45.949
We'll see that with the graph
and it'll be even more clear.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11282-0
00:52:46.119 --> 00:52:47.429
But what did you actually do?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11295-0
00:52:47.439 --> 00:52:50.289
You were aggressive the moment
you saw one path.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11308-0
00:52:50.379 --> 00:52:52.489
You believed that it was going
to take you to the foot.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11315-0
00:52:52.679 --> 00:52:54.639
You kept on going in that path
aggressively.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11327-0
00:52:54.649 --> 00:52:57.819
You did not consider all the
other paths right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11336-0
00:52:57.829 --> 00:52:59.459
That is why DFS is aggressive.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11342-0
00:53:00.009 --> 00:53:00.999
Same concept here.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11354-0
00:53:01.069 --> 00:53:03.879
Here also you have Discovery
Edge that is using solid lines.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11375-0
00:53:04.149 --> 00:53:07.634
Here also you have dotted lines,
but here it is called as back

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11375-1
00:53:07.634 --> 00:53:09.349
edge it is not called as cross.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11383-0
00:53:10.299 --> 00:53:12.519
OK, let's do that.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11407-0
00:53:12.529 --> 00:53:15.444
In this case, let's do it on a
directed graph, but here also

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11407-1
00:53:15.444 --> 00:53:16.639
you can do it undirected.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11412-0
00:53:16.649 --> 00:53:17.799
Also, it's the same concept.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11426-0
00:53:18.659 --> 00:53:23.000
Yeah, consider this graph below
and perform DFS with D as start

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11426-1
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:23.339
node.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11436-0
00:53:24.179 --> 00:53:26.589
Yeah, we should be very careful,
Jagdish.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11448-0
00:53:27.039 --> 00:53:29.069
In this case, we have been told
where to start.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11473-0
00:53:29.619 --> 00:53:32.411
If we have not been told, then
we can use alphabetical

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11473-1
00:53:32.411 --> 00:53:35.254
ordering, but here it's been
told so we will start from

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11473-2
00:53:35.254 --> 00:53:35.559
there.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11480-0
00:53:37.359 --> 00:53:38.469
I have a visitor array.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11484-0
00:53:38.699 --> 00:53:39.679
I also have a stack.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11488-0
00:53:40.849 --> 00:53:41.259
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11491-0
00:53:41.299 --> 00:53:42.099
Just listen to me.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11510-0
00:53:42.109 --> 00:53:45.469
What we're going to do you start
with a node that has been given

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11510-1
00:53:45.469 --> 00:53:45.779
to us.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11514-0
00:53:46.169 --> 00:53:46.849
Change the color.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11520-0
00:53:47.949 --> 00:53:48.939
Put him in the output.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11526-0
00:53:49.409 --> 00:53:50.699
Mark him as visited.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11536-0
00:53:51.169 --> 00:53:53.819
Pushing onto the stack now who's
the stack top?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11546-0
00:53:56.029 --> 00:53:57.409
Have pushed him onto the stack
there.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11551-0
00:53:58.309 --> 00:53:58.429
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11558-0
00:53:59.289 --> 00:54:00.549
Is there in the stack top?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11570-0
00:54:01.389 --> 00:54:04.739
I asked myself now D is the
stack top.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11579-0
00:54:05.019 --> 00:54:06.339
Where all can D take me.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11585-0
00:54:07.319 --> 00:54:08.309
We're all can detect me.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11609-0
00:54:09.589 --> 00:54:14.959
They can take me to see decan
take me to YFD can take me to E

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11615-0
00:54:13.809 --> 00:54:15.589
Yep, not.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11609-1
00:54:14.959 --> 00:54:15.479
right.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11632-0
00:54:15.549 --> 00:54:21.529
It has three edges from D to
CD2FD2E it yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11631-0
00:54:19.999 --> 00:54:20.339
Hello.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11642-0
00:54:23.889 --> 00:54:26.849
And now again, alphabetical
ordering.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11685-0
00:54:27.099 --> 00:54:30.920
I can either go to F or CORE,
but since we are following

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11685-1
00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:35.008
alphabetical ordering we will go
to CI, go to see my changes

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11685-2
00:54:35.008 --> 00:54:38.829
color, I mark him as visited, I
push him onto the stack.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11700-0
00:54:39.279 --> 00:54:43.759
Now my stack top is CI ask
myself where can C take me?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11706-0
00:54:44.479 --> 00:54:45.279
Where can she take me?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11727-0
00:54:48.389 --> 00:54:51.340
Check the nature of the graph
and then tell me can see even

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11727-1
00:54:51.340 --> 00:54:52.619
take me anywhere, nowhere.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11732-0
00:54:52.689 --> 00:54:52.899
Right.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11740-0
00:54:53.739 --> 00:54:55.709
This is where that puzzle
problem right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11743-0
00:54:56.259 --> 00:54:57.369
You got stuck somewhere.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11753-0
00:54:57.379 --> 00:54:58.769
No, it cannot take you to F
Amit.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11755-0
00:54:58.779 --> 00:54:59.049
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11779-0
00:54:59.059 --> 00:55:03.403
Be very careful, this is a
directed graph from FI can go to

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11779-1
00:55:03.403 --> 00:55:06.009
C but from CI cannot go to F
right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11786-0
00:55:06.019 --> 00:55:07.069
So it cannot take me anywhere.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11802-0
00:55:07.079 --> 00:55:10.617
I'm stuck there similar to that
maze problem where you got stuck

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11802-1
00:55:10.617 --> 00:55:11.379
at that point.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11813-0
00:55:11.389 --> 00:55:13.459
What you did, you take one step
back.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11826-0
00:55:13.589 --> 00:55:16.666
You use your eraser, you go back
and then take another path,

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11826-1
00:55:16.666 --> 00:55:16.969
right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11841-0
00:55:17.029 --> 00:55:20.929
Similarly, here we are going to
now pop that see from my stack.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11854-0
00:55:22.669 --> 00:55:25.839
No nodes adjacent to see,
meaning cannot continue.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11868-0
00:55:25.889 --> 00:55:29.872
So backtrack that is, pop the
stack and restore the previous

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11868-1
00:55:29.872 --> 00:55:30.199
data.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11875-0
00:55:30.569 --> 00:55:31.499
So I'll remove that.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11881-0
00:55:31.509 --> 00:55:32.589
See, I'm back to D now.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11890-0
00:55:33.319 --> 00:55:34.589
No, we're all can detect me.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11899-0
00:55:35.169 --> 00:55:37.059
He could have taken me to CFE.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11920-0
00:55:37.099 --> 00:55:40.863
But see, I have already visited
it can either take me to FRE

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11920-1
00:55:40.863 --> 00:55:43.269
between F&amp;E alphabetical
ordering.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11925-0
00:55:43.319 --> 00:55:44.259
I'll go to the path.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11933-0
00:55:46.219 --> 00:55:48.569
I'll mark him as visited.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11946-0
00:55:48.799 --> 00:55:50.729
I change this color, I put them
in the output.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11957-0
00:55:50.789 --> 00:55:52.169
I push him on to the stack.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11971-0
00:55:52.529 --> 00:55:56.349
Now stack top is E I'll ask
myself where all can E take me?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11980-0
00:55:56.859 --> 00:55:57.679
Where can he take me?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/11990-0
00:55:58.759 --> 00:56:00.429
Is only one place which he can
take me.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12018-0
00:56:00.439 --> 00:56:04.109
He can take me to G so go there,
change his color, admin the

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12018-1
00:56:04.109 --> 00:56:07.479
output, mark them as visited,
push them onto the stack.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12033-0
00:56:07.889 --> 00:56:10.969
Now stack top is G where all can
G take me.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12059-0
00:56:12.019 --> 00:56:16.604
G can take me to D as well as H
but D is already in a different

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12059-1
00:56:16.604 --> 00:56:20.329
color, meaning it's been already
marked as visited.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12073-0
00:56:20.759 --> 00:56:22.869
So what will happen to this G2D?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12087-0
00:56:23.909 --> 00:56:27.159
Can someone tell me what type of
age should I book there?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12102-0
00:56:29.329 --> 00:56:30.429
D is already there in the
output.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12106-0
00:56:30.439 --> 00:56:31.429
I've already visited him.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12109-0
00:56:31.119 --> 00:56:31.819
Cross edge.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12111-0
00:56:32.729 --> 00:56:33.539
Yeah, very good.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12137-0
00:56:33.709 --> 00:56:37.920
That's nothing but dotted and in
this use case, when we are in

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12137-1
00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:40.259
DFS that is not called Cross
Edge.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12146-0
00:56:40.429 --> 00:56:41.549
That is called a back edge.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12155-0
00:56:42.409 --> 00:56:44.599
In BFS world it is called cross.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12192-0
00:56:45.089 --> 00:56:48.754
In DFS world, it is called back,
but it is the same concept, so

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12192-1
00:56:48.754 --> 00:56:52.534
I'm not going to take it because
it's again going to take me to D

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12192-2
00:56:52.534 --> 00:56:54.309
only, which I don't want to do.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12201-0
00:56:54.539 --> 00:56:55.889
So I'm still at G only.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12211-0
00:56:55.999 --> 00:57:00.359
Where else can geotech me you
can take me now too H.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12221-0
00:57:01.729 --> 00:57:02.899
So I'll change this color.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12225-0
00:57:02.909 --> 00:57:04.179
I'll mark him as visited.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12232-0
00:57:04.189 --> 00:57:05.359
I'll put him in the output.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12240-0
00:57:05.509 --> 00:57:06.899
I'll push him onto the stack.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12252-0
00:57:07.249 --> 00:57:10.299
No stack top is edge, so we're
all can hedge.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12276-0
00:57:10.309 --> 00:57:14.849
Take me, which can take me to
A&amp;B, but because of

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12271-0
00:57:13.479 --> 00:57:14.269
It won't be.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12276-1
00:57:14.849 --> 00:57:17.959
alphabetical ordering, I'll go
to a.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12291-0
00:57:19.589 --> 00:57:21.399
I change this color, I put them
in the output.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12299-0
00:57:21.409 --> 00:57:23.259
I marked them as visited in my
array.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12309-0
00:57:23.369 --> 00:57:25.069
I also pushed them onto the
stack.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12328-0
00:57:25.429 --> 00:57:29.499
Now stack top is a where all can
a take me can only take me to B.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12342-0
00:57:29.899 --> 00:57:33.619
So I go to BI change this color,
I mark them as visited.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12353-0
00:57:33.629 --> 00:57:34.519
I put them in the output.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12358-0
00:57:34.529 --> 00:57:35.579
I push him into the stack.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12374-0
00:57:36.549 --> 00:57:39.789
What is the stack top B where
all can B take me?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12383-0
00:57:41.629 --> 00:57:43.679
Yeah, it all can be.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12386-0
00:57:43.689 --> 00:57:44.139
Take me now.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12392-0
00:57:44.149 --> 00:57:44.759
No where.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12397-0
00:57:44.839 --> 00:57:45.599
So what should I do?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12401-0
00:57:45.609 --> 00:57:46.189
I'm stuck now.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12412-0
00:57:46.249 --> 00:57:48.069
I cannot go anywhere now, so I
will do.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12416-0
00:57:48.949 --> 00:57:49.839
I will pop him.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12420-0
00:57:49.889 --> 00:57:50.529
I'll remove.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12434-0
00:57:50.539 --> 00:57:53.849
I'll come back to state A can I
take me anywhere?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12454-0
00:57:53.859 --> 00:57:57.545
Apart from BB's already visited
so again a also cannot take me

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12454-1
00:57:57.545 --> 00:57:58.949
anywhere, so I'll pop a.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12460-0
00:57:58.959 --> 00:58:00.579
Also, I'm back to hedge.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12495-0
00:58:01.359 --> 00:58:05.061
Hitch would have taken me to A
or BI had initially taken that

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12495-1
00:58:05.061 --> 00:58:08.704
route a I could have taken B
also, but now that B is already

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12495-2
00:58:08.704 --> 00:58:11.929
visited, So what will happen to
this particular edge?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12510-0
00:58:14.329 --> 00:58:18.889
He weighs, know it dotted,
perfect again.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12522-0
00:58:18.899 --> 00:58:21.269
Remove hatch also because
nowhere else he can take me.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12526-0
00:58:21.279 --> 00:58:22.549
I'm back to GG.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12556-0
00:58:22.559 --> 00:58:25.489
Could have taken me to H which I
have already taken with solid G

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12556-1
00:58:25.489 --> 00:58:28.239
could have taken me to D that's
already dotted nowhere else.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12562-0
00:58:28.249 --> 00:58:28.889
You can take me.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12566-0
00:58:29.119 --> 00:58:30.509
So I'll pop G also.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12577-0
00:58:31.379 --> 00:58:33.669
Again, I'm back to E where can
he take me?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12596-0
00:58:33.909 --> 00:58:36.565
You can only take me to G, which
I had already taken, so we

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12596-1
00:58:36.565 --> 00:58:37.849
cannot take me anywhere else.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12618-0
00:58:37.859 --> 00:58:41.661
I'll poppy also come back to D
is there anywhere else that D

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12618-1
00:58:41.661 --> 00:58:42.409
can take me?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12637-0
00:58:42.519 --> 00:58:47.765
Yes, you can take me to F so
I'll go to F I'll change this

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12637-1
00:58:47.765 --> 00:58:48.299
color.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12642-0
00:58:48.659 --> 00:58:49.929
I'll mark him as visited.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12651-0
00:58:50.019 --> 00:58:51.269
I'll push him onto the stack.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12673-0
00:58:51.699 --> 00:58:55.303
Where can F take me if can take
me to see, but she is already

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12673-1
00:58:55.303 --> 00:58:56.349
marked as visited.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12686-0
00:58:56.659 --> 00:59:00.894
So F2C becomes dotted and then
anywhere else can you take me?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12686-1
00:59:00.894 --> 00:59:01.099
No.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12693-0
00:59:01.249 --> 00:59:02.099
So I'll remove F.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12706-0
00:59:02.109 --> 00:59:05.589
Also, I'm back to D&amp;D, take
me anywhere else.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12713-0
00:59:06.449 --> 00:59:07.989
He he's also done right.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12732-0
00:59:07.999 --> 00:59:12.047
He cannot take me anywhere else,
so I removed D also and my stack

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12732-1
00:59:12.047 --> 00:59:12.599
is empty.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12751-0
00:59:12.969 --> 00:59:17.646
That simply means my depth first
traversal is completed and this

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12751-1
00:59:17.646 --> 00:59:18.869
is my DFS output.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12753-0
00:59:20.819 --> 00:59:21.049
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12769-0
00:59:21.059 --> 00:59:22.449
Is this clear? Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12806-0
00:59:21.119 --> 00:59:25.093
SO11 quick question if there is
a solid line then also we're

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12806-1
00:59:25.093 --> 00:59:29.262
putting the dotted line in this
DFS, but it was not the case in

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12798-0
00:59:29.259 --> 00:59:29.589
No, no.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12806-2
00:59:29.262 --> 00:59:30.369
the BFS like F2C.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12819-0
00:59:29.599 --> 00:59:34.030
Actually, what we are doing is,
uh, in that case I was drawing a

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12819-1
00:59:34.030 --> 00:59:35.189
new output right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12830-0
00:59:35.499 --> 00:59:38.149
In this case I have just altered
the same existing graph.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12840-0
00:59:38.159 --> 00:59:39.969
That is why it looked to you
like that.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12853-0
00:59:41.319 --> 00:59:43.009
Yeah, you'll get it right.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12868-0
00:59:42.089 --> 00:59:44.179
OK, I'm good.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12885-0
00:59:43.079 --> 00:59:46.371
If you solve this like how we
did for BFS, if you draw a new

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12885-1
00:59:46.371 --> 00:59:48.799
output right when D is visited,
you add him.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12881-0
00:59:47.189 --> 00:59:47.429
Umm.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12904-0
00:59:49.059 --> 00:59:51.850
Then from G you order dotted,
otherwise you add a solid, so

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12895-0
00:59:49.449 --> 00:59:49.839
Got it.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12904-1
00:59:51.850 --> 00:59:53.199
you will get the same output.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12912-0
00:59:54.139 --> 00:59:55.629
Uh, OK.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12907-0
00:59:55.279 --> 00:59:55.459
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12918-0
00:59:57.239 --> 00:59:58.649
Well, is the concept clear guys?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12925-0
00:59:58.659 --> 00:59:59.459
What all did you do?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12937-0
00:59:59.509 --> 01:00:02.529
You changed someone's color, you
marked them as visited.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12952-0
01:00:02.619 --> 01:00:05.329
You put them in the output, you
push them onto the stack.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12960-0
01:00:05.459 --> 01:00:07.089
Over is in the stack top.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12968-0
01:00:07.159 --> 01:00:09.549
You ask yourself, where else can
you take you?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12980-0
01:00:09.659 --> 01:00:12.609
You keep doing it when he's not
there, you will.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12987-0
01:00:12.619 --> 01:00:13.849
He cannot take you anywhere.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/12993-0
01:00:13.939 --> 01:00:15.189
You will pop him.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13000-0
01:00:15.239 --> 01:00:16.549
You'll go back to the previous
state.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13009-0
01:00:19.739 --> 01:00:20.629
Yeah, so far, so good.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13016-0
01:00:20.639 --> 01:00:21.719
All of you DFS.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13023-0
01:00:22.999 --> 01:00:24.499
Now there is a small twist here.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13044-0
01:00:24.819 --> 01:00:30.691
Yeah, in this problem I tell you
to start the whole problem using

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13044-1
01:00:30.691 --> 01:00:32.649
alphabetical ordering.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13077-0
01:00:33.139 --> 01:00:36.905
I tell you, do the whole
traversal, but start it from the

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13077-1
01:00:36.905 --> 01:00:40.605
node a yeah, if you start from
the node A, how will this

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13077-2
01:00:40.605 --> 01:00:41.579
problem behave?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13087-0
01:00:43.199 --> 01:00:45.809
I start with a I mark him as
visited.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13097-0
01:00:46.369 --> 01:00:47.729
Yeah, I push him onto the stack.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13107-0
01:00:47.739 --> 01:00:51.189
This is the output, yeah, from
a.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13112-0
01:00:51.199 --> 01:00:52.229
Where else you can take me?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13130-0
01:00:52.239 --> 01:00:55.209
He can only take me to BI, mark
him as visited in the output.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13157-0
01:00:55.219 --> 01:00:59.381
I push him onto the stack from
BI cannot go anywhere, so I pop

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13157-1
01:00:59.381 --> 01:01:01.099
B and again I'm back to a.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13164-0
01:01:01.819 --> 01:01:02.979
He cannot take me anywhere.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13168-0
01:01:02.989 --> 01:01:04.139
I remove a.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13177-0
01:01:04.149 --> 01:01:07.899
Also stack became empty and this
is my only output.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13183-0
01:01:09.419 --> 01:01:10.569
Yeah, the man was right.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13188-0
01:01:10.579 --> 01:01:11.199
Only AB.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13191-0
01:01:11.209 --> 01:01:11.909
That's only the output.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13226-0
01:01:14.649 --> 01:01:18.253
99% of students will leave it
here, and that is a mistake

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13226-1
01:01:18.253 --> 01:01:21.546
because fundamentally, by
definition, a traversal is

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13226-2
01:01:21.546 --> 01:01:24.529
something where you are visiting
all the nodes.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13236-0
01:01:25.399 --> 01:01:27.499
But in this case you have not
been able to visit.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13248-0
01:01:28.699 --> 01:01:30.529
Yeah, only B is then output.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13252-0
01:01:30.539 --> 01:01:31.809
The stack became already empty.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13255-0
01:01:32.349 --> 01:01:32.539
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13265-0
01:01:33.959 --> 01:01:35.619
Is this problem clear for all of
you?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13267-0
01:01:36.639 --> 01:01:36.929
Yes.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13272-0
01:01:36.939 --> 01:01:37.019
No.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13291-0
01:01:37.779 --> 01:01:40.629
If you start with the node which
cannot take you to all the

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13291-1
01:01:40.629 --> 01:01:42.149
nodes, this problem will happen.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13295-0
01:01:42.549 --> 01:01:43.089
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13310-0
01:01:43.499 --> 01:01:45.665
And you will get some partial
output here and then you are

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13310-1
01:01:45.665 --> 01:01:45.849
done.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13345-0
01:01:45.859 --> 01:01:49.773
Your stack is already empty, so
in those cases you should write

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13345-1
01:01:49.773 --> 01:01:53.504
a line telling that if I start
this traversal with a, I will

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13345-2
01:01:53.504 --> 01:01:55.339
only be able to reach A&amp;B.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13370-0
01:01:56.339 --> 01:02:00.417
So then what you would do is you
will then continue this problem

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13370-1
01:02:00.417 --> 01:02:03.429
by taking some other node as the
starting node.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13373-0
01:02:03.899 --> 01:02:04.529
Yeah, exactly.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13383-0
01:02:04.539 --> 01:02:06.889
Yeah, you will take some other
node again now.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13406-0
01:02:06.959 --> 01:02:10.739
Yeah, let's assume you will take
C or DEV or H or D whatever, and

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13406-1
01:02:10.739 --> 01:02:13.259
then you will try to continue
this problem.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13432-0
01:02:15.459 --> 01:02:18.703
It's no, you'll keep doing like
that until you have visited all

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13425-0
01:02:16.759 --> 01:02:17.189
Ohh.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13432-1
01:02:18.703 --> 01:02:19.109
of them.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13460-0
01:02:20.489 --> 01:02:24.758
I said I actually I didn't got
the intuition which you have

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13445-0
01:02:20.709 --> 01:02:21.119
Yeah, go ahead.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13446-0
01:02:20.759 --> 01:02:21.109
So the.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13460-1
01:02:24.758 --> 01:02:26.679
said at the last statement.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13468-0
01:02:26.739 --> 01:02:29.179
Like once our stacked is got
empty.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13489-0
01:02:29.189 --> 01:02:33.499
So what is the point of
relevance for putting a NP again

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13489-1
01:02:33.499 --> 01:02:36.599
in the stack and returning it as
output?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13507-0
01:02:37.269 --> 01:02:38.479
I didn't got this point.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13508-0
01:02:37.719 --> 01:02:39.349
No, we are not putting it in the
stack.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13522-0
01:02:39.719 --> 01:02:42.649
So similar to here, I was just
putting the output here.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13531-0
01:02:43.199 --> 01:02:44.709
Once you removed BNA, that's it.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13576-0
01:02:44.719 --> 01:02:48.303
The stack is empty and as per
our original definition, when a

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13545-0
01:02:47.009 --> 01:02:47.339
OK.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13576-1
01:02:48.303 --> 01:02:51.830
stack is empty, your traversal
is done, so you believe it is

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13568-0
01:02:51.369 --> 01:02:51.859
Correction.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13576-2
01:02:51.830 --> 01:02:55.009
done, but have you actually
covered all the end nodes?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13604-0
01:02:56.989 --> 01:03:00.705
In this graph there is a
BCDEFGH, but in your output

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13592-0
01:02:57.519 --> 01:02:57.899
OK.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13604-1
01:03:00.705 --> 01:03:02.739
there is only A&amp;B, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13629-0
01:03:04.269 --> 01:03:08.039
So you have not been able to
visit all the nodes when you

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13617-0
01:03:04.569 --> 01:03:05.099
OK, Sir.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13629-1
01:03:08.039 --> 01:03:09.989
started your traversal with a.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13639-0
01:03:10.859 --> 01:03:13.209
So at that time you should not
just leave it there.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13641-0
01:03:13.519 --> 01:03:13.929
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13654-0
01:03:13.989 --> 01:03:15.809
So then you should try with some
other node.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13682-0
01:03:15.819 --> 01:03:19.129
Maybe you'll start with H as the
starting node or you will start

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13682-1
01:03:19.129 --> 01:03:21.929
with G or you will start with D
and then you will try.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13707-0
01:03:21.939 --> 01:03:25.685
If you are able to achieve if
nothing is possible, then you

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13707-1
01:03:25.685 --> 01:03:29.494
will visit each one of them
alone and you will put an output

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13707-2
01:03:29.494 --> 01:03:29.869
right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13719-0
01:03:30.059 --> 01:03:32.129
So A/B will be a separate output
comma.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13727-0
01:03:32.169 --> 01:03:33.409
Then you start with some other
node.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13730-0
01:03:33.419 --> 01:03:35.319
Let's suppose C from.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13736-0
01:03:35.329 --> 01:03:36.299
See, you cannot go anywhere.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13755-0
01:03:36.309 --> 01:03:39.137
So see alone becomes the output,
and then you start with some

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13755-1
01:03:39.137 --> 01:03:39.639
other node.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13771-0
01:03:39.649 --> 01:03:43.629
Say you know D, so from D you
will be able to go to others.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13775-0
01:03:43.789 --> 01:03:44.529
Something like that.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13796-0
01:03:44.919 --> 01:03:49.617
So all that I'm trying to say is
let's assume there is a a very

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13796-1
01:03:49.617 --> 01:03:51.379
simple use case for you.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13808-0
01:03:51.389 --> 01:03:53.899
There is this exact graph and
then there is this part.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13818-0
01:03:57.389 --> 01:03:58.879
This whole thing is 1 graph now.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13829-0
01:03:58.889 --> 01:04:02.679
Yeah, you started D you got all
the output.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13834-0
01:04:02.949 --> 01:04:03.939
Yeah, you got this.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13845-0
01:04:04.049 --> 01:04:05.629
Have you still completed the
traversal?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13865-0
01:04:07.109 --> 01:04:10.317
Because P&amp;Q are not there in
your output, but your stack is

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13867-0
01:04:10.149 --> 01:04:10.479
I.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13865-1
01:04:10.317 --> 01:04:11.019
already empty.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13876-0
01:04:11.439 --> 01:04:14.139
So in this case you should not
leave the problem here.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13889-0
01:04:14.349 --> 01:04:17.729
You should again tell that what
will you tell.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13919-0
01:04:18.079 --> 01:04:22.277
In this case you will tell if I
start from DI will not be able

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13919-1
01:04:22.277 --> 01:04:26.209
to reach some nodes because the
graph itself is like that,

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13919-2
01:04:26.209 --> 01:04:26.609
right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13927-0
01:04:26.779 --> 01:04:28.829
This graph is a disconnected
graph.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13937-0
01:04:28.879 --> 01:04:30.409
I cannot reach PNQ at all.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13970-0
01:04:30.769 --> 01:04:33.564
So you will tell that line and
again you will start this

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13970-1
01:04:33.564 --> 01:04:36.457
problem with P or Q as the
starting node and then you will

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13970-2
01:04:36.457 --> 01:04:37.879
add them again in the output.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13972-0
01:04:39.489 --> 01:04:39.999
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/13984-0
01:04:40.089 --> 01:04:42.379
Or let's say suppose this was
connected like this.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14004-0
01:04:43.669 --> 01:04:47.237
Will you still be able to reach
P if you had started the problem

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14004-1
01:04:47.237 --> 01:04:48.719
from D, you would have not.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14024-0
01:04:49.289 --> 01:04:53.035
Yeah, your whole problem will
get completed, but you could

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14024-1
01:04:53.035 --> 01:04:54.749
have not gone to PRQ right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14076-0
01:04:54.849 --> 01:04:57.898
So in that case also I'll
mention that line that if we

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14076-1
01:04:57.898 --> 01:05:01.445
start from D I'll not be able to
visit all nodes and then start

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14076-2
01:05:01.445 --> 01:05:04.494
the problem again from some
other node start from P so

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14076-3
01:05:04.494 --> 01:05:06.489
you'll get P&amp;Q as your
outputs.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14102-0
01:05:07.409 --> 01:05:11.135
So this whole thing in simple
the crux is if there are N nodes

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14102-1
01:05:11.135 --> 01:05:14.269
in your graph, nodes should be
there in your output.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14111-0
01:05:15.239 --> 01:05:17.489
We don't bother if it's
disconnected, connected.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14125-0
01:05:17.499 --> 01:05:19.109
Can I go to a node or not all
that?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14133-0
01:05:19.359 --> 01:05:20.989
Finally, the output should have
all of them.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14156-0
01:05:21.299 --> 01:05:23.870
If you are not able to go to
some nodes, then again you'll

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14156-1
01:05:23.870 --> 01:05:25.439
have to retry with some other
node.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14160-0
01:05:26.409 --> 01:05:26.569
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14163-0
01:05:27.879 --> 01:05:28.529
Got it, Sir.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14169-0
01:05:28.129 --> 01:05:29.019
Is this clear guys?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14174-0
01:05:28.539 --> 01:05:28.899
Thank you.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14177-0
01:05:29.469 --> 01:05:29.989
No problem.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14183-0
01:05:29.699 --> 01:05:31.429
Uh, so one question here.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14189-0
01:05:29.999 --> 01:05:32.029
Yeah, yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14200-0
01:05:32.119 --> 01:05:35.659
In the DFS we will get the nodes
connected with the arrow, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14210-0
01:05:37.259 --> 01:05:38.399
Corrected with arrow meaning.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14211-0
01:05:38.869 --> 01:05:39.409
Connecting.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14227-0
01:05:39.529 --> 01:05:44.959
Yeah, the like D is connected to
F but D is going to F right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14252-0
01:05:45.169 --> 01:05:49.685
Like in BFS, there is no arrow,
it's only vector row parallel

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14252-1
01:05:49.685 --> 01:05:51.579
rows parallel line. Sorry.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14257-0
01:05:52.449 --> 01:05:53.479
You mean our example?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14259-0
01:05:54.129 --> 01:05:54.789
Yeah, yeah, yes.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14269-0
01:05:56.509 --> 01:05:58.699
So that was just an example.
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14274-0
01:05:57.879 --> 01:05:58.629
You, yes.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14307-0
01:05:58.789 --> 01:06:03.589
So you can have arrows in this
graph and you can still do BFS

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14307-1
01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:05.989
also in that and DFS also yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14309-0
01:06:05.639 --> 01:06:07.339
Yeah, I I got it said.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14319-0
01:06:07.349 --> 01:06:10.509
But in DFS we will get only rows
not this vector, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14328-0
01:06:12.379 --> 01:06:13.539
So which vector you mean?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14355-0
01:06:14.889 --> 01:06:19.798
Sorry like like one is connected
to two correct and two is also

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14360-0
01:06:18.769 --> 01:06:22.209
Correct credit.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14355-1
01:06:19.798 --> 01:06:21.639
connected to one in BFS.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14379-0
01:06:21.869 --> 01:06:26.021
But in DFS, if the row is
corrected then that means he's

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14379-1
01:06:26.021 --> 01:06:28.279
one is connected to two, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14382-0
01:06:27.979 --> 01:06:28.509
Yeah, correct.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14393-0
01:06:28.479 --> 01:06:28.809
We can.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14417-0
01:06:28.519 --> 01:06:31.208
For example, if there's an arrow
here, it means one is connected

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14417-1
01:06:31.208 --> 01:06:33.814
to two, but two is not connected
to one, so you cannot go that

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14417-2
01:06:33.814 --> 01:06:33.979
way.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14412-0
01:06:34.549 --> 01:06:34.959
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14421-0
01:06:35.009 --> 01:06:35.399
OK.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14423-0
01:06:35.449 --> 01:06:36.059
That's it.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14426-0
01:06:35.499 --> 01:06:36.929
Yeah, that's correct.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14442-0
01:06:36.939 --> 01:06:39.759
Yeah, well, now let's go to.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14440-0
01:06:37.129 --> 01:06:37.569
Thank you, Sir.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14445-0
01:06:38.249 --> 01:06:39.339
Soon I have one question.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14451-0
01:06:39.919 --> 01:06:40.379
Yeah, go ahead.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14483-0
01:06:41.019 --> 01:06:46.689
So in terms of BFS and DFS, the
discovery edges are helping us

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14483-1
01:06:46.689 --> 01:06:52.179
to find the path, but what is
the significance of the cross?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14476-0
01:06:49.139 --> 01:06:49.409
Correct.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14489-0
01:06:52.189 --> 01:06:53.359
Edges are back edges.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14516-0
01:06:53.369 --> 01:06:57.683
I mean in terms of application,
why are we even identifying them

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14516-1
01:06:57.683 --> 01:07:01.399
and listing down in terms of use
case application wise?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14524-0
01:07:01.689 --> 01:07:04.059
Is there any significance
advantage for it?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14546-0
01:07:04.529 --> 01:07:08.996
Because the solid lines helping
us to find the path and what is

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14540-0
01:07:06.469 --> 01:07:08.129
Umm OK.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14546-1
01:07:08.996 --> 01:07:11.369
the significance of dotted
lines?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14548-0
01:07:11.619 --> 01:07:12.049
What?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14554-0
01:07:12.059 --> 01:07:13.099
How it helps us?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14571-0
01:07:14.149 --> 01:07:16.559
Maybe the duplicacy we can omit?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14563-0
01:07:15.839 --> 01:07:16.389
Exactly.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14579-0
01:07:16.399 --> 01:07:18.709
Yeah, short answer is you have
to find that out.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14605-0
01:07:19.269 --> 01:07:22.871
But in simple if you think about
in the other terms are these

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14605-1
01:07:22.871 --> 01:07:26.298
dotted lines actually helping or
contributing in the graph

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14605-2
01:07:26.298 --> 01:07:26.879
traversal?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14616-0
01:07:27.859 --> 01:07:29.499
Are they even need it for this
graph?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14620-0
01:07:31.069 --> 01:07:31.219
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14646-0
01:07:31.229 --> 01:07:35.008
I think on those terms, if I
start from B, I'm able to visit

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14646-1
01:07:35.008 --> 01:07:38.229
all of them even without these
dotted lines, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14678-0
01:07:38.399 --> 01:07:42.435
So if all these nodes are some
we know houses and if these

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14678-1
01:07:42.435 --> 01:07:46.539
lines are some you know cabling,
I don't need these extras,

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14678-2
01:07:46.539 --> 01:07:46.949
right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14699-0
01:07:47.109 --> 01:07:50.859
So cross edges are back edges is
helping me determine what is

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14689-0
01:07:47.569 --> 01:07:47.869
Right.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14699-1
01:07:50.859 --> 01:07:52.069
actually not needed.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14739-0
01:07:52.819 --> 01:07:56.271
If you had started this graph in
some other fashion, to traverse

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14739-1
01:07:56.271 --> 01:07:59.352
some other nodes would have
become duplicate, but you are

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14739-2
01:07:59.352 --> 01:08:02.591
still able to know that some
nodes some edges are not taking

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14739-3
01:08:02.591 --> 01:08:03.919
you to some newer places.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14753-0
01:08:04.019 --> 01:08:06.909
So why do you even need it so
that nodes can be determined?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14765-0
01:08:07.849 --> 01:08:09.419
Yeah, but there is more to it.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14764-0
01:08:08.229 --> 01:08:08.579
OK.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14781-0
01:08:09.489 --> 01:08:13.222
So I will recommend you to read
more about what is backage what

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14781-1
01:08:13.222 --> 01:08:14.039
is Cross Edge.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14791-0
01:08:14.109 --> 01:08:15.839
There are some theorems on it
and so on.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14801-0
01:08:16.049 --> 01:08:17.789
So you can try to, you know,
explore about them.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14802-0
01:08:19.219 --> 01:08:19.569
Sure.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14816-0
01:08:19.579 --> 01:08:20.109
Thank you for you.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14809-0
01:08:20.769 --> 01:08:20.979
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14844-0
01:08:20.989 --> 01:08:23.719
And we will explore more about
these in the later part of the

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14844-1
01:08:23.719 --> 01:08:26.494
course because later part what
we will do in all these arrows,

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14844-2
01:08:26.494 --> 01:08:28.079
we will start putting some
numbers.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14861-0
01:08:28.149 --> 01:08:31.299
Yeah, that is nothing but the
cost from going to this place to

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14861-1
01:08:31.299 --> 01:08:31.899
this course.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14870-0
01:08:31.989 --> 01:08:33.819
Let's suppose this is the fair
or.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14878-0
01:08:33.829 --> 01:08:34.819
This is the kilometer.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14896-0
01:08:35.229 --> 01:08:38.271
So in those cases, these dotted
edges, et cetera will become

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14896-1
01:08:38.271 --> 01:08:39.019
very important.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14924-0
01:08:39.549 --> 01:08:43.498
I would always want to make the
largest cost to be a dotted line

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14924-1
01:08:43.498 --> 01:08:46.839
so that I can use the, you know,
minimum and all that.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14940-0
01:08:47.009 --> 01:08:49.359
But yeah, when the time comes,
we will look at all that.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14953-0
01:08:49.769 --> 01:08:51.429
But is DFS clear for all of you?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14956-0
01:08:52.419 --> 01:08:53.649
So I got a doubt here.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14963-0
01:08:54.089 --> 01:08:54.249
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14977-0
01:08:54.199 --> 01:08:58.505
So you you did mention about the
maze as example right for DFS,

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14974-0
01:08:57.849 --> 01:08:58.339
Correct.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14977-1
01:08:58.505 --> 01:08:58.909
right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14990-0
01:08:58.619 --> 01:08:59.309
Correct. Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/14998-0
01:08:59.059 --> 01:09:02.609
If you see the ordered node that
where visited right DC e.g.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15031-0
01:09:02.619 --> 01:09:07.845
HABF this has been not been
connected in the no same order

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15031-1
01:09:07.845 --> 01:09:12.629
right with the arrow, right D2C
and D2 E that's fine.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15034-0
01:09:13.189 --> 01:09:13.369
Right.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15036-0
01:09:13.619 --> 01:09:14.999
Then it goes to G.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15055-0
01:09:16.179 --> 01:09:17.649
Right. So.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15040-0
01:09:16.689 --> 01:09:17.069
Right.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15043-0
01:09:17.079 --> 01:09:17.379
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15049-0
01:09:17.389 --> 01:09:17.659
No, no.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15062-0
01:09:17.669 --> 01:09:19.979
The maze part is only partially
applicable here.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15091-0
01:09:19.989 --> 01:09:25.645
For example this you know from D
to E from E2G and from G to H

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15091-1
01:09:25.645 --> 01:09:27.979
and from GH2A from A to B.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15095-0
01:09:28.129 --> 01:09:29.229
Then you are stuck right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15102-0
01:09:29.239 --> 01:09:30.119
Then what do you do?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15121-0
01:09:30.349 --> 01:09:33.525
Then you come back to a, then
you come back to H then this

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15121-1
01:09:33.525 --> 01:09:34.279
becomes cross.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15124-0
01:09:34.289 --> 01:09:35.459
So that's philosophy.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15138-0
01:09:35.469 --> 01:09:37.619
Wise this is DFS you mean right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15144-0
01:09:36.689 --> 01:09:37.729
OK, alright, good.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15157-0
01:09:37.629 --> 01:09:40.731
You you go hit a endpoint when
you are not able to go any

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15157-1
01:09:40.731 --> 01:09:41.159
further.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15165-0
01:09:41.169 --> 01:09:42.079
Even in this case, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15185-0
01:09:42.089 --> 01:09:45.416
D2C you went from D to C, but
from C you could not go

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15185-1
01:09:45.416 --> 01:09:47.819
anywhere, so you came back to D
again.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15200-0
01:09:48.279 --> 01:09:50.649
You came back to D and then went
to E, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15207-0
01:09:50.629 --> 01:09:51.399
Alright, got you.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15217-0
01:09:50.659 --> 01:09:52.619
That concept is the maze
concept, yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15211-0
01:09:52.909 --> 01:09:53.359
Got you.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15222-0
01:09:53.369 --> 01:09:53.709
Thank you.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15242-0
01:09:54.299 --> 01:09:57.865
And if we start from a in this
case will not get the connected

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15242-1
01:09:57.865 --> 01:09:59.789
spanning tree for our DFS,
right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15243-0
01:10:00.689 --> 01:10:01.119
Correct.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15249-0
01:10:01.509 --> 01:10:02.369
Yeah, you will not get it.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15260-0
01:10:02.379 --> 01:10:03.489
So you'll not just leave it
there.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15268-0
01:10:03.499 --> 01:10:04.769
You will then start with another
node.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15272-0
01:10:05.649 --> 01:10:05.969
Books.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15312-0
01:10:06.739 --> 01:10:06.859
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15294-0
01:10:07.299 --> 01:10:11.606
So so one more question, if
there is a there is another node

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15294-1
01:10:11.606 --> 01:10:14.219
P which is directed from the B
node.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15298-0
01:10:16.329 --> 01:10:16.879
OK.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15354-0
01:10:16.889 --> 01:10:21.486
And now we went to from H2A and
2B and then P when we come back

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15354-1
01:10:21.486 --> 01:10:26.083
from H again and we're traveling
to the we, we should not go to

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15320-0
01:10:21.899 --> 01:10:22.149
Correct.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15338-0
01:10:24.449 --> 01:10:24.659
Correct.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15354-2
01:10:26.083 --> 01:10:27.879
the P Now because we are.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15358-0
01:10:27.299 --> 01:10:29.519
Yeah, we should not go because P
already visited. Correct.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15366-0
01:10:30.009 --> 01:10:30.509
Yes, OK.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15362-0
01:10:31.329 --> 01:10:31.559
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15373-0
01:10:31.569 --> 01:10:33.419
That's why we have this visited
array for you.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15386-0
01:10:33.479 --> 01:10:35.659
So if that is already ticked, we
will not go there.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15409-0
01:10:35.909 --> 01:10:38.489
Yep, we would have already got
ticked there. How?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15400-0
01:10:36.259 --> 01:10:36.469
I.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15398-0
01:10:36.359 --> 01:10:36.579
OK.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15405-0
01:10:38.379 --> 01:10:38.849
Chips.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15412-0
01:10:38.779 --> 01:10:40.749
I said one question here.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15414-0
01:10:38.999 --> 01:10:39.319
Thank you.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15442-0
01:10:40.759 --> 01:10:46.863
Suppose if I started with a OK,
I can travel still be only OK,

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15421-0
01:10:41.249 --> 01:10:41.399
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15440-0
01:10:43.789 --> 01:10:46.269
OK, correct.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15442-1
01:10:46.863 --> 01:10:47.929
so now A/B.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15473-0
01:10:48.019 --> 01:10:55.487
So now A/B came in my stack and
I again that put out from the

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15473-1
01:10:55.487 --> 01:11:01.389
stack and I have gone to now are
two other note.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15462-0
01:10:56.429 --> 01:10:56.659
Correct.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15491-0
01:11:02.149 --> 01:11:07.219
So uh AB will be come in the
visited node, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15493-0
01:11:07.739 --> 01:11:08.689
Correct.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15500-0
01:11:08.699 --> 01:11:09.529
B alone will come.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15508-0
01:11:08.999 --> 01:11:09.219
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15517-0
01:11:09.999 --> 01:11:13.169
Nothing else can come, so here
you will have something like a.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15526-0
01:11:13.179 --> 01:11:16.159
You'll have B and then A/B will
be visited.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15529-0
01:11:16.549 --> 01:11:17.119
Nothing else.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15546-0
01:11:17.129 --> 01:11:21.729
So you can again pop B Pop A so
you you are now stuck.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15568-0
01:11:22.059 --> 01:11:25.642
There's only two in the output,
so at that place you have to

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15560-0
01:11:24.129 --> 01:11:24.349
OK.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15568-1
01:11:25.642 --> 01:11:27.639
start again with some other
node.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15569-0
01:11:28.369 --> 01:11:28.799
Right.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15589-0
01:11:28.889 --> 01:11:33.919
But A/B will be still in the uh
order node visited right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15582-0
01:11:33.209 --> 01:11:33.549
Correct.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15592-0
01:11:33.559 --> 01:11:34.339
That will be visited.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15620-0
01:11:34.049 --> 01:11:38.339
That will be half OK. OK.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15601-0
01:11:34.349 --> 01:11:35.789
Yeah, these two are already
visited.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15642-0
01:11:35.799 --> 01:11:39.365
You are only pending with these,
so you can either start with CD

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15642-1
01:11:39.365 --> 01:11:42.492
or whatever and complete them,
but in the output already

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15642-2
01:11:42.492 --> 01:11:45.399
A&amp;B are there, meaning
visitor is already there.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15641-0
01:11:43.489 --> 01:11:44.329
OK, OK.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15646-0
01:11:48.149 --> 01:11:50.099
Yeah, cool.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15659-0
01:11:50.489 --> 01:11:53.179
Next step, your textbook way
exactly same notations.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15666-0
01:11:53.189 --> 01:11:54.179
This is unexplored.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15675-0
01:11:54.249 --> 01:11:58.279
This Violet color means visited
normal blue line is unexplored.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15679-0
01:11:58.449 --> 01:11:59.439
This is discovery.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15693-0
01:11:59.449 --> 01:12:01.609
This is dotted his baggage.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15699-0
01:12:02.389 --> 01:12:04.879
So initially you start from a,
you go to B.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15718-0
01:12:05.869 --> 01:12:11.533
Let's assume for a minute if we
were doing BFS then from a where

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15718-1
01:12:11.533 --> 01:12:13.799
you would have gone, yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15732-0
01:12:16.939 --> 01:12:19.139
From a in this case, I'm going
to B.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15742-0
01:12:19.919 --> 01:12:22.029
If it was BFS, what would have
been the next step?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15752-0
01:12:22.779 --> 01:12:24.289
Where else can he take me?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15766-0
01:12:24.589 --> 01:12:26.919
That is what is a question in
exactly.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15768-0
01:12:25.029 --> 01:12:26.669
Being CD.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15790-0
01:12:27.759 --> 01:12:30.826
It could have taken me to see it
could have taken me to D it

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15790-1
01:12:30.826 --> 01:12:33.039
could have taken me to E, but
what is this?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15807-0
01:12:33.089 --> 01:12:37.139
This is DFS to be a physics as
deep as possible.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15832-0
01:12:37.329 --> 01:12:41.047
So the moment I came from A to
BI forget a now, so now I'm

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15832-1
01:12:41.047 --> 01:12:43.379
looking at where else can B take
me.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15888-0
01:12:43.509 --> 01:12:47.621
So I'm going from B to C, and
then when I'd say reach C, I'm

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15888-1
01:12:47.621 --> 01:12:51.800
asking where else can see take
me so see 2A became dotted and

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15888-2
01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:56.181
she will take me to D he took me
to D and I'm at D now from D is

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15888-3
01:12:56.181 --> 01:12:59.619
dotted line because it is
already there in output.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15896-0
01:13:01.019 --> 01:13:02.489
So where else can it take me?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15908-0
01:13:02.619 --> 01:13:04.909
It cannot take me anywhere else,
so I come back.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15934-0
01:13:04.919 --> 01:13:08.675
I come back to see right and
from CI go to E and from E this

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15934-1
01:13:08.675 --> 01:13:11.199
becomes dotted and my traversal
is over.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15941-0
01:13:12.429 --> 01:13:13.719
So what is the output here?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15980-0
01:13:14.129 --> 01:13:19.284
Initially it was a A took me to
B from BI went to C from C This

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15980-1
01:13:19.284 --> 01:13:24.439
became dotted so they took me to
D from D This became dotted it

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15980-2
01:13:24.439 --> 01:13:27.339
it could not take me anywhere
else.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15994-0
01:13:27.349 --> 01:13:29.829
So I came back to see and from
see I went to.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/15999-0
01:13:31.119 --> 01:13:32.859
That is my DFS output.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16012-0
01:13:35.269 --> 01:13:37.919
If this is complex, don't do it
like this.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16022-0
01:13:37.929 --> 01:13:39.559
Go ahead and try to do like us.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16026-0
01:13:39.769 --> 01:13:40.719
Just have a stack.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16039-0
01:13:40.729 --> 01:13:43.399
Try to do step by step and get
the same answers.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16042-0
01:13:44.009 --> 01:13:44.189
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16048-0
01:13:45.619 --> 01:13:46.069
Is it clear?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16054-0
01:13:46.079 --> 01:13:46.749
Days all of you.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16067-0
01:13:46.899 --> 01:13:48.939
So in this case, initially it
was there.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16078-0
01:13:49.689 --> 01:13:52.449
Then we went into the stack,
then see went into the stack.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16080-0
01:13:53.009 --> 01:13:53.339
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16095-0
01:13:53.349 --> 01:13:56.899
Then D went in, then D got
popped and then E came in.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16099-0
01:13:57.369 --> 01:13:58.579
Then E also got popped.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16110-0
01:13:58.589 --> 01:14:00.579
He got popped, we got popped, a
got popped.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16120-0
01:14:01.029 --> 01:14:02.479
Yeah, all that is not shown
here.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16131-0
01:14:02.969 --> 01:14:04.539
That is why it is the textbook
way, yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16151-0
01:14:06.319 --> 01:14:09.004
Again, a small code, so I'm not
going through all this because

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16151-1
01:14:09.004 --> 01:14:10.069
it's for you to practice.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16160-0
01:14:10.079 --> 01:14:12.089
I will also be uploading a
Python notebook.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16228-0
01:14:12.199 --> 01:14:15.107
There are this is more of a
pseudo code but Python also I

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16228-1
01:14:15.107 --> 01:14:18.216
will upload but in simple you
have a stack you push things in

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16228-2
01:14:18.216 --> 01:14:21.274
it, you mark it as visited until
that stack is not empty you

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16228-3
01:14:21.274 --> 01:14:24.433
remove the top and you see who
are the neighbors of it and you

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16228-4
01:14:24.433 --> 01:14:26.439
keep pushing them again into the
stack.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16243-0
01:14:26.839 --> 01:14:29.931
The same thing that we just did,
but it's up to you to trace

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16243-1
01:14:29.931 --> 01:14:30.489
every line.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16246-0
01:14:30.559 --> 01:14:31.069
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16278-0
01:14:31.139 --> 01:14:34.884
To that again, as I told, if I
just tweak this DFS, add a

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16278-1
01:14:34.884 --> 01:14:39.145
couple of more lines, it will be
able to do a lot more things for

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16278-2
01:14:39.145 --> 01:14:39.339
us.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16285-0
01:14:39.649 --> 01:14:41.139
All of them are good exercises.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16294-0
01:14:41.149 --> 01:14:45.079
Practice them and compare it
with your text solutions.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16307-0
01:14:46.799 --> 01:14:48.889
Again, there is a lot of excise
questions here.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16309-0
01:14:49.159 --> 01:14:49.499
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16327-0
01:14:49.539 --> 01:14:55.472
If I go to the last part of this
deck, yeah, perform BFS and DFS

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16327-1
01:14:55.472 --> 01:14:56.659
on the below.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16335-0
01:14:56.779 --> 01:14:59.529
Yeah, there is an undirected
graph.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16347-0
01:14:59.609 --> 01:15:02.399
You should do both BFS and DFS
in this.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16354-0
01:15:03.639 --> 01:15:04.939
Similarly, there is this graph.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16363-0
01:15:04.949 --> 01:15:08.709
You should do both BFS DFS like
these questions.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16368-0
01:15:09.619 --> 01:15:10.539
I love these questions.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16377-0
01:15:10.549 --> 01:15:11.599
There's a graph given to you.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16400-0
01:15:13.059 --> 01:15:16.629
It has been asked to do a BFS
and then tell me which of these

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16400-1
01:15:16.629 --> 01:15:18.299
four are they correct output?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16427-0
01:15:19.439 --> 01:15:22.562
Yeah, you can expect these type
of questions in your MCQ's you

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16427-1
01:15:22.562 --> 01:15:24.099
will actually do the whole BFS.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16438-0
01:15:24.109 --> 01:15:27.339
BFS you will compare which one
of them is a correct answer.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16440-0
01:15:28.679 --> 01:15:29.249
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16467-0
01:15:29.339 --> 01:15:33.133
Are you understanding this
problem in this M has been used

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16467-1
01:15:33.133 --> 01:15:37.249
as the start N has been used, Q
has been used, P has been used.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16476-0
01:15:37.739 --> 01:15:40.209
You believe all of them are
correct, correct?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16507-0
01:15:40.219 --> 01:15:43.092
Because traversal wise you can
start from any node like these

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16507-1
01:15:43.092 --> 01:15:45.686
question right in this each one
of them have started in

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16507-2
01:15:45.686 --> 01:15:47.169
different different start nodes.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16519-0
01:15:47.539 --> 01:15:50.569
So you should verify which of
them is a correct BFS.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16526-0
01:15:52.439 --> 01:15:53.349
Yeah, you be able to do this.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16539-0
01:15:54.979 --> 01:15:57.389
Yeah, you're expected to do this
in one minute.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16554-0
01:15:57.579 --> 01:16:01.066
Yeah, that is why again, tell
you please practice all these

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16554-1
01:16:01.066 --> 01:16:01.589
concepts.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16574-0
01:16:01.599 --> 01:16:05.196
There are shortcuts, of course,
but the right way to do is start

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16574-1
01:16:05.196 --> 01:16:06.579
from M, do the traversal.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16585-0
01:16:06.629 --> 01:16:08.339
Are you getting this as the
correct one?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16593-0
01:16:08.509 --> 01:16:09.939
If you got it, this is the
correct answer.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16604-0
01:16:10.309 --> 01:16:11.699
Otherwise, go to the next one
and so on.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16612-0
01:16:12.979 --> 01:16:16.039
Yeah, MULAY for this graph.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16620-0
01:16:16.119 --> 01:16:17.869
Implement DFS and BFS traversal.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16629-0
01:16:17.879 --> 01:16:20.429
Assume C to be the source node,
C is here.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16631-0
01:16:20.759 --> 01:16:21.069
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16637-0
01:16:21.079 --> 01:16:21.949
Where is C here?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16647-0
01:16:22.319 --> 01:16:23.409
So you will start here end.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16649-0
01:16:23.419 --> 01:16:24.089
You'll try to do it.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16653-0
01:16:25.629 --> 01:16:25.959
Cool.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16661-0
01:16:25.969 --> 01:16:28.279
That's pretty much about BFS and
DFS.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16668-0
01:16:28.349 --> 01:16:30.199
There is a lot more about
graphs.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16672-0
01:16:30.209 --> 01:16:30.559
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16696-0
01:16:30.569 --> 01:16:34.282
The moment we have directed
graph right directed graphs, we

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16696-1
01:16:34.282 --> 01:16:37.624
have a lot of interesting
questions on who all can be

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16696-2
01:16:37.624 --> 01:16:38.119
reached.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16702-0
01:16:38.129 --> 01:16:39.259
Wall cannot be reached.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16709-0
01:16:39.599 --> 01:16:40.979
There's a lot of such concepts.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16721-0
01:16:41.209 --> 01:16:43.699
We will come back to all that
after the mid semester.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16725-0
01:16:44.109 --> 01:16:44.689
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16737-0
01:16:44.729 --> 01:16:47.792
And after the midsemester there
was a lot of graph algorithms

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16737-1
01:16:47.792 --> 01:16:48.039
also.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16746-0
01:16:48.189 --> 01:16:50.739
Yeah, like shortest path between
two nodes.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16751-0
01:16:50.749 --> 01:16:51.399
How can we go?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16773-0
01:16:51.809 --> 01:16:55.763
Can I have some way to connect
all the nodes but it's total

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16773-1
01:16:55.763 --> 01:16:57.279
cost should be minimum?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16777-0
01:16:57.689 --> 01:16:59.579
Yeah, like minimum spanning
tree.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16783-0
01:16:59.689 --> 01:17:00.979
Lot of algorithms are there.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16818-0
01:17:00.989 --> 01:17:04.574
We will learn about it in the
later part of the semester, but

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16818-1
01:17:04.574 --> 01:17:08.390
for now we will pause for graphs
and we will start with something

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16818-2
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:09.199
called as BST.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16828-0
01:17:09.589 --> 01:17:12.179
But we'll take a quick break and
then we will start.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16833-0
01:17:12.349 --> 01:17:13.239
I'll be still around.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16850-0
01:17:13.629 --> 01:17:16.908
Yeah, if you have any other
general things we can chat about

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16850-1
01:17:16.908 --> 01:17:17.069
it.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16863-0
01:17:17.979 --> 01:17:20.649
The last coexistence, there are
two seats, I believe.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16868-0
01:17:21.279 --> 01:17:22.879
No, that is G, yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16870-0
01:17:23.019 --> 01:17:23.719
T.O.K.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16871-0
01:17:24.929 --> 01:17:25.289
So.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16879-0
01:17:27.789 --> 01:17:28.469
This one right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16883-0
01:17:29.539 --> 01:17:31.059
So this is C this is G.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16886-0
01:17:32.439 --> 01:17:32.729
OK.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16890-0
01:17:33.629 --> 01:17:33.749
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16907-0
01:17:35.279 --> 01:17:37.970
And will tell us about the fact
that So what you mentioned

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16907-1
01:17:37.970 --> 01:17:38.289
before.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16918-0
01:17:39.229 --> 01:17:39.589
Which one?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16915-0
01:17:40.319 --> 01:17:40.609
Uh.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16936-0
01:17:40.619 --> 01:17:43.115
You also mentioned that there is
a software to find out the

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16936-1
01:17:43.115 --> 01:17:43.739
pathway for X3.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16937-0
01:17:45.069 --> 01:17:45.519
Oh yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16944-0
01:17:45.529 --> 01:17:47.179
I mean the traversal and so on,
right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16953-0
01:17:48.989 --> 01:17:50.509
Let me just quickly pull that
up.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16960-0
01:17:56.689 --> 01:17:57.509
You see if.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16987-0
01:18:24.119 --> 01:18:26.849
Yeah, just let me know once
you're able to see the browser.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/16997-0
01:18:27.179 --> 01:18:29.129
With all due credits, this is
not from bits.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17007-0
01:18:29.139 --> 01:18:30.609
This is from another university.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17009-0
01:18:31.079 --> 01:18:31.269
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17021-0
01:18:32.169 --> 01:18:32.509
2nd.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17013-0
01:18:32.559 --> 01:18:32.749
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17023-0
01:18:32.759 --> 01:18:34.469
Let me know once you are able to
see this.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17027-0
01:18:34.769 --> 01:18:35.029
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17042-0
01:18:35.039 --> 01:18:38.006
So this is, uh, breadth first
search and there is a graph

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17042-1
01:18:38.006 --> 01:18:39.029
already given to us.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17064-0
01:18:39.039 --> 01:18:41.987
You can also choose like you
know you want a directed graph

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17064-1
01:18:41.987 --> 01:18:43.559
or you want an undirected graph.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17079-0
01:18:43.879 --> 01:18:47.029
You can choose whether you want
a small graph or a large graph.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17084-0
01:18:47.039 --> 01:18:48.109
You put large like.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17103-0
01:18:48.159 --> 01:18:51.416
He'll get a really huge one and
then you can also, you know, put

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17103-1
01:18:51.416 --> 01:18:52.869
what representation you need.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17111-0
01:18:52.919 --> 01:18:55.589
Like, do you guys relate to all
this?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17119-0
01:18:55.599 --> 01:18:56.869
We learned all this in the
class, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17130-0
01:18:57.609 --> 01:18:58.929
This is that decency list way.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17148-0
01:18:59.789 --> 01:19:01.709
This is the matrix way, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17154-0
01:19:02.829 --> 01:19:05.641
Wherever there is a, you know,
representation, there is A1

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17154-1
01:19:05.641 --> 01:19:05.879
edge.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17165-0
01:19:06.009 --> 01:19:09.211
Otherwise, it's zero logical is
they have just put the graph

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17165-1
01:19:09.211 --> 01:19:09.579
itself.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17167-0
01:19:09.809 --> 01:19:10.379
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17185-0
01:19:10.689 --> 01:19:15.157
And then when you want to run
this right, you can change the

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17185-1
01:19:15.157 --> 01:19:16.329
animation speed.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17201-0
01:19:16.399 --> 01:19:19.575
I will prefer to keep it
somewhere here and just try to

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17201-1
01:19:19.575 --> 01:19:20.709
give the start node.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17240-0
01:19:21.159 --> 01:19:25.080
Yeah, I want to start it from
zero in this case, and if I just

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17240-1
01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:29.124
click on run BFS it will slowly
do the animation and it will run

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17240-2
01:19:29.124 --> 01:19:29.809
it for you.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17264-0
01:19:31.139 --> 01:19:35.211
Visited it is marking as true
and it is also putting them in

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17264-1
01:19:35.211 --> 01:19:38.349
the you know output here it
changes the color.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17269-0
01:19:38.359 --> 01:19:39.479
It's exactly what we did only.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17286-0
01:19:41.879 --> 01:19:44.009
You can alter the speed if you
want even slower.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17294-0
01:19:44.079 --> 01:19:45.449
It'll do it in slower way.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17334-0
01:19:45.539 --> 01:19:48.982
You can alter the speeds and all
you can do it on both type of

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17334-1
01:19:48.982 --> 01:19:52.370
graphs or you can have a new
graph every time you refresh you

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17334-2
01:19:52.370 --> 01:19:54.939
will get a new graph the I'll
upload all this.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17343-0
01:19:54.949 --> 01:19:55.999
Yeah, it's there in my deck,
Krishna.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17352-0
01:19:57.489 --> 01:19:59.159
So this is for the BFS.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17360-0
01:19:59.199 --> 01:20:01.149
Similarly, you have one for DFS
also.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17369-0
01:20:02.249 --> 01:20:04.739
Yeah, let's try to do some cheap
hacks.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17375-0
01:20:04.789 --> 01:20:05.629
Let's see if that works.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17380-0
01:20:07.049 --> 01:20:07.719
Yes, it does.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17382-0
01:20:08.089 --> 01:20:08.479
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17393-0
01:20:08.489 --> 01:20:13.169
So let's start here from, say
one, and let's run DFS.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17396-0
01:20:20.409 --> 01:20:20.569
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17417-0
01:20:22.529 --> 01:20:25.900
So always try to, you know,
slower this animation don't have

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17417-1
01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:26.619
it very fast.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17427-0
01:20:26.769 --> 01:20:29.459
So slow it and try to do it on
your own.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17429-0
01:20:29.469 --> 01:20:29.739
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17442-0
01:20:29.749 --> 01:20:32.619
Then try to, you know, run it
and get your.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17456-0
01:20:32.869 --> 01:20:36.369
If you are getting the same
output or not and so on, right.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17480-0
01:20:37.109 --> 01:20:39.674
Let's say you click on new graph
every time you click on this new

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17480-1
01:20:39.674 --> 01:20:41.229
graph button, you will get a new
graph.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17494-0
01:20:41.289 --> 01:20:44.019
Yeah, let's say you got this
graph copied down in a paper.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17504-0
01:20:44.819 --> 01:20:46.689
Try to do it and how we learned.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17521-0
01:20:46.759 --> 01:20:50.049
Yeah, the same pay only try to
do it in our fashion.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17532-0
01:20:50.239 --> 01:20:52.489
Get the output start from the
same node.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17544-0
01:20:52.499 --> 01:20:55.199
Let's say you start from zero,
then give zero as the output.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17561-0
01:20:55.209 --> 01:20:58.874
Here just try to run it and get
the whole answers and then

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17561-1
01:20:58.874 --> 01:21:00.489
compare with your answers.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17570-0
01:21:00.759 --> 01:21:01.979
Have you got it correct or not?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17579-0
01:21:03.509 --> 01:21:05.169
They don't use this to solve it.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17591-0
01:21:07.159 --> 01:21:09.069
Yeah, you didn't miss anything.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17605-0
01:21:09.159 --> 01:21:11.249
So folks, we just asking me, are
there some tools?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17625-0
01:21:11.559 --> 01:21:15.470
So there are a lot of animation
tools where you can visualize

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17625-1
01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:15.849
these.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17640-0
01:21:15.859 --> 01:21:19.459
You know type of algorithms and
you can see the final outputs.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17670-0
01:21:20.299 --> 01:21:23.814
So I was just showing those
things, but as I told in your

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17670-1
01:21:23.814 --> 01:21:27.389
exams and so on, you will not be
able to use the Internet.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17682-0
01:21:27.739 --> 01:21:29.649
So you cannot use these
websites.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17701-0
01:21:30.079 --> 01:21:32.793
So while you learn, it'll be
useful if you are a visual

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17701-1
01:21:32.793 --> 01:21:34.199
learner, you know this helps.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17713-0
01:21:37.949 --> 01:21:41.189
Uh, so something like.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17719-0
01:21:42.589 --> 01:21:43.019
Yeah, go ahead.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17717-0
01:21:43.639 --> 01:21:44.419
The yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17744-0
01:21:44.429 --> 01:21:48.387
So, like uh, leaving the
actually choose to start vertex,

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17744-1
01:21:48.387 --> 01:21:51.799
we assume that we know all the
nodes or vertices.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17768-0
01:21:51.809 --> 01:21:56.639
That is there like I mean it's
not that we go and OK, OK.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17756-0
01:21:54.399 --> 01:21:54.629
Correct.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17803-0
01:21:56.949 --> 01:22:00.371
Yeah, we we are not assuming we
know that because we have been

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17777-0
01:21:57.879 --> 01:21:58.229
You.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17803-1
01:22:00.371 --> 01:22:03.956
given either adjacency list or a
metrics right from there we will

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17797-0
01:22:03.339 --> 01:22:03.579
OK.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17803-2
01:22:03.956 --> 01:22:06.129
know how many nodes are there,
correct?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17812-0
01:22:07.409 --> 01:22:07.679
Alright.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17818-0
01:22:07.889 --> 01:22:09.439
So we pick one of them from
that.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17827-0
01:22:09.549 --> 01:22:12.269
Usually we provide the starting
one zero or one whatever.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17834-0
01:22:14.179 --> 01:22:14.459
OK.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17848-0
01:22:15.409 --> 01:22:18.269
Yeah, that that information is
there.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17850-0
01:22:15.629 --> 01:22:17.419
So for example, so whether we
will be asked to.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17860-0
01:22:18.769 --> 01:22:21.089
What the graph is that
information we have right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17867-0
01:22:21.099 --> 01:22:22.499
Otherwise, we will not even
know, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17877-0
01:22:23.009 --> 01:22:25.059
Like have we completed the
problem or not?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17886-0
01:22:25.229 --> 01:22:26.459
Let's say there are 20 nodes.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17894-0
01:22:26.889 --> 01:22:28.679
Your output gave you only 14
nodes.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17897-0
01:22:27.719 --> 01:22:27.849
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17915-0
01:22:29.069 --> 01:22:32.611
You don't even know that if the
problem was complete or not,

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/17915-1
01:22:32.611 --> 01:22:35.049
this graph representation is

01:25:41.979 --> 01:25:45.381
I have already conveyed this and
for people who are either

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/18742-1
01:25:45.381 --> 01:25:48.380
outside or maybe in the
different sector, or if you

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/18742-2
01:25:48.380 --> 01:25:52.013
know, for group of people who
are not in India, then something

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/18745-0
01:25:50.169 --> 01:25:50.919
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/18752-0
01:25:51.849 --> 01:25:54.169
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/18742-3
01:25:52.013 --> 01:25:53.109
will be taken care.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/18764-0
01:25:53.159 --> 01:25:56.359
It is gone all the way higher
up. Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/18757-0
01:25:54.239 --> 01:25:55.489
That will be much helpful.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/18780-0
01:25:55.499 --> 01:25:57.289
Yes, yes, that will be much
helpful.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/18803-0
01:25:56.409 --> 01:25:59.859
So these decisions are not at my
level, it will be taken at, you

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/18786-0
01:25:57.939 --> 01:25:58.589
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/18794-0
01:25:58.999 --> 01:26:00.569
Yeah, I yeah, yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/18803-1
01:25:59.859 --> 01:26:02.089
know, say so, but it is already
in there.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/18821-0
01:26:00.579 --> 01:26:03.679
Since the mode of exam. Yes.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/18805-0
01:26:02.099 --> 01:26:02.419
Here.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/18814-0
01:26:02.469 --> 01:26:03.809
Yeah, they are discussing it.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/18831-0
01:26:03.689 --> 01:26:03.899
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/18823-0
01:26:03.939 --> 01:26:05.369
You will get a positive note.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/18835-0
01:26:04.669 --> 01:26:06.729
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/18843-0
01:26:05.639 --> 01:26:07.629
You will not have the exam on
the very same day.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/18839-0
01:26:06.739 --> 01:26:07.089
Thank you.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/18847-0
01:26:07.099 --> 01:26:07.399
Thank you.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/18853-0
01:26:07.779 --> 01:26:08.989
Yeah, of course.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/18861-0
01:26:08.789 --> 01:26:09.579
Yes, yes, yes.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/18873-0
01:26:08.999 --> 01:26:10.449
Because, you know, it is still
not clear.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/18871-0
01:26:09.589 --> 01:26:11.839
Because, you know, we have a one
week of time.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/18874-0
01:26:11.849 --> 01:26:12.159
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/18887-0
01:26:12.169 --> 01:26:14.599
Yeah, because timing and all are
varying too much.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/18905-0
01:26:14.609 --> 01:26:17.465
So definitely we will be
requesting to take consideration

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/18894-0
01:26:15.099 --> 01:26:15.299
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/18932-0
01:26:16.859 --> 01:26:19.233
Yeah, there are a couple of
options that has being weighed,

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/18905-1
01:26:17.465 --> 01:26:17.859
on that.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/18921-0
01:26:17.869 --> 01:26:18.509
Thank you. PATHAK.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/18924-0
01:26:19.109 --> 01:26:19.309
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/18932-1
01:26:19.233 --> 01:26:20.499
so that will be taken care here.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/18929-0
01:26:20.139 --> 01:26:21.839
Umm yeah, thanks.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/18933-0
01:26:21.849 --> 01:26:22.259
Thank you.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/18946-0
01:26:22.269 --> 01:26:22.669
Thank you. Bye.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/18940-0
01:26:22.639 --> 01:26:22.929
Cool.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/18953-0
01:26:23.499 --> 01:26:25.829
OK, someone please share the
link to mock exam.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/18955-0
01:26:25.839 --> 01:26:26.009
OK.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/18975-0
01:26:26.019 --> 01:26:29.573
Yeah, that's there in your
emails, maximum number of inputs

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/18975-1
01:26:29.573 --> 01:26:31.409
we can consider for assignment.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/18979-0
01:26:31.419 --> 01:26:32.649
Or any number.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/18992-0
01:26:32.659 --> 01:26:36.449
Yeah, that is what is our
algorithm analysis, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/18998-0
01:26:36.799 --> 01:26:38.069
All edge conditions.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19026-0
01:26:38.079 --> 01:26:41.521
All of those you should consider
your Python code will be

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19026-1
01:26:41.521 --> 01:26:45.201
actually tested, meaning we will
run it and see for any given

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19026-2
01:26:45.201 --> 01:26:46.269
input valid input.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19032-0
01:26:46.279 --> 01:26:47.239
Is it working or not?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19071-0
01:26:47.479 --> 01:26:50.859
I can even give invalid input,
so for invalid input you're

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19071-1
01:26:50.859 --> 01:26:54.353
assignment code should first of
all recognize that these are

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19071-2
01:26:54.353 --> 01:26:57.618
invalid inputs and it should
gracefully handle using try

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19071-3
01:26:57.618 --> 01:26:58.649
catch block, yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19085-0
01:27:00.049 --> 01:27:03.179
So can we have multiple set of
input or single set of input?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19090-0
01:27:04.589 --> 01:27:05.799
Each time single set.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19103-0
01:27:05.869 --> 01:27:08.379
Yeah, you cannot give hundreds
of input all at once.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19113-0
01:27:07.789 --> 01:27:08.029
OK.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19105-0
01:27:08.799 --> 01:27:09.079
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19117-0
01:27:09.089 --> 01:27:10.129
One you will give, you'll run
it.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19125-0
01:27:10.189 --> 01:27:11.639
Then you want some other input.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19129-0
01:27:11.649 --> 01:27:12.569
You'll again give, and so on.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19135-0
01:27:15.519 --> 01:27:16.549
Yeah, that's right, SURENDRA.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19147-0
01:27:16.559 --> 01:27:19.470
Yeah, even if you gave
alphabetically and and expect

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19147-1
01:27:19.470 --> 01:27:20.129
such things.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19156-0
01:27:20.139 --> 01:27:21.429
Yeah, I've known for all this.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19167-0
01:27:21.679 --> 01:27:25.009
So there might be questions
which are not solvable.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19184-0
01:27:25.099 --> 01:27:28.375
Yeah, I might still end up
giving that you tell that this

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19184-1
01:27:28.375 --> 01:27:29.279
is not solvable.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19190-0
01:27:29.289 --> 01:27:30.089
I'll give you full marks.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19194-0
01:27:31.089 --> 01:27:31.249
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19202-0
01:27:33.099 --> 01:27:34.429
So that is also a learning,
right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19218-0
01:27:34.439 --> 01:27:37.753
You you know very well the
concept that, you know this

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19218-1
01:27:37.753 --> 01:27:39.259
cannot be applied, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19232-0
01:27:40.029 --> 01:27:42.679
So such things I mean, not now
in the open book.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19238-0
01:27:42.689 --> 01:27:43.739
Let's see about all that.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19241-0
01:27:44.589 --> 01:27:44.849
Cool.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19245-0
01:27:44.859 --> 01:27:45.739
Let's get started.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19250-0
01:27:45.749 --> 01:27:47.319
Again, we have already know.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19257-0
01:27:47.329 --> 01:27:48.639
Been discussing for a long time.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19260-0
01:27:48.989 --> 01:27:50.729
So cool.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19281-0
01:27:50.779 --> 01:27:54.070
So graph we have completed right
all the techniques how to

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19281-1
01:27:54.070 --> 01:27:56.189
represent it the traversals all
that.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19296-0
01:27:56.559 --> 01:27:59.659
So now we will go back to
another data structure which is

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19296-1
01:27:59.659 --> 01:28:01.049
called binary search tree.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19302-0
01:28:01.159 --> 01:28:02.269
Yeah, it's called BST.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19308-0
01:28:02.759 --> 01:28:04.289
So what exactly is this? BST.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19316-0
01:28:04.719 --> 01:28:06.439
Yeah, just by the word.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19321-0
01:28:06.449 --> 01:28:07.439
Are you able to guess something?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19327-0
01:28:09.489 --> 01:28:10.459
Binary search tree.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19333-0
01:28:10.469 --> 01:28:11.529
So what data structure is this?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19336-0
01:28:15.779 --> 01:28:15.939
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19344-0
01:28:16.359 --> 01:28:16.559
3.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19357-0
01:28:17.589 --> 01:28:18.539
Linklist store array.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19347-0
01:28:17.749 --> 01:28:18.199
Exactly.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19350-0
01:28:18.209 --> 01:28:18.839
It is a tree.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19370-0
01:28:19.329 --> 01:28:22.469
Yeah, it is a tree because the
name itself has tree and it also

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19370-1
01:28:22.469 --> 01:28:23.499
has that word binary.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19380-0
01:28:23.769 --> 01:28:25.239
So then it has to be a binary
tree.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19382-0
01:28:25.529 --> 01:28:25.879
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19407-0
01:28:25.889 --> 01:28:29.535
So it is a binary binary tree,
and if it is a binary tree as

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19407-1
01:28:29.535 --> 01:28:31.089
guru says it is nonlinear.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19414-0
01:28:31.379 --> 01:28:32.859
Yeah, all this is clear now.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19420-0
01:28:32.869 --> 01:28:33.949
What does that search word?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19424-0
01:28:34.179 --> 01:28:34.969
What is this?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19450-0
01:28:35.479 --> 01:28:38.890
You know, something new will
differs from normal binary, so

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19450-1
01:28:38.890 --> 01:28:42.244
we have already discussed
different representations in all

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19450-2
01:28:42.244 --> 01:28:42.699
of them.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19464-0
01:28:43.169 --> 01:28:46.959
We did not impose any
restriction on the nodes data.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19476-0
01:28:47.149 --> 01:28:51.189
Did we any number any value can
be there in any node?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19509-0
01:28:51.299 --> 01:28:54.705
Yeah, we did not put any
restrictions there, but only one

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19509-1
01:28:54.705 --> 01:28:58.287
thing we told is if it is a
binary tree, every internal node

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19509-2
01:28:58.287 --> 01:28:59.109
can have Axum.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19514-0
01:28:59.119 --> 01:28:59.579
Two children.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19563-0
01:28:59.589 --> 01:29:02.889
That's all we told, but that two
children can be anything we did

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19563-1
01:29:02.889 --> 01:29:06.087
not put any restriction there,
but now we are going to do that

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19563-2
01:29:06.087 --> 01:29:09.134
as a result to search for an
element, we need to check both

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19563-3
01:29:09.134 --> 01:29:11.469
in the left subtree and in the
right subtree.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19582-0
01:29:12.429 --> 01:29:15.741
Yeah, due to this, the worst
case complexity of search

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19582-1
01:29:15.741 --> 01:29:18.089
operation in a binary tree is
big off.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19584-0
01:29:18.099 --> 01:29:18.269
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19591-0
01:29:19.189 --> 01:29:19.769
Do you understand?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19601-0
01:29:19.779 --> 01:29:22.649
This slide is a normal binary
tree given to you.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19611-0
01:29:22.759 --> 01:29:23.989
I need to search for an element.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19616-0
01:29:24.199 --> 01:29:25.329
You never know where that is.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19646-0
01:29:25.779 --> 01:29:28.683
You start from the root, you
search all the directions left

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19646-1
01:29:28.683 --> 01:29:31.733
and right, left and right, and
ultimately you might get it, or

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19646-2
01:29:31.733 --> 01:29:32.749
you might not get it.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19661-0
01:29:33.039 --> 01:29:36.203
And the worst cases we go off
when you have inspected all the

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19661-1
01:29:36.203 --> 01:29:36.509
nodes.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19667-0
01:29:37.579 --> 01:29:38.339
It can be improved.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19673-0
01:29:38.349 --> 01:29:41.539
This yes, by doing what?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19696-0
01:29:41.949 --> 01:29:45.171
By putting some constraints so
as the name suggests, the main

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19696-1
01:29:45.171 --> 01:29:47.509
use of this representation is
for searching.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19714-0
01:29:47.909 --> 01:29:51.817
In this representation we impose
restriction on the kind of data

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19714-1
01:29:51.817 --> 01:29:52.959
a node can contain.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19725-0
01:29:53.509 --> 01:29:57.149
As a result, it reduces the
worst case complexity to log in.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19740-0
01:29:57.919 --> 01:30:00.509
Yeah, but, but let's see if it
is really log in or not.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19742-0
01:30:00.999 --> 01:30:01.169
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19758-0
01:30:02.229 --> 01:30:05.259
So what does this BST in a
binary search tree?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19784-0
01:30:05.409 --> 01:30:09.438
All the left sub tree elements
should be less than the root

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19784-1
01:30:09.438 --> 01:30:13.669
data and all the right subtree
elements should be greater than

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19784-2
01:30:13.669 --> 01:30:14.609
the root data.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19794-0
01:30:16.449 --> 01:30:18.359
This is called a binary search
tree property.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19808-0
01:30:18.649 --> 01:30:22.265
Note that this property should
be satisfied at every node in

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19808-1
01:30:22.265 --> 01:30:22.799
the tree.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19821-0
01:30:23.229 --> 01:30:25.399
Very important guys, not at just
at the root.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19833-0
01:30:25.769 --> 01:30:29.689
At every level, every place this
property should hold good.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19851-0
01:30:31.509 --> 01:30:34.352
The left subtree of a node
contains only nodes with keys

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19851-1
01:30:34.352 --> 01:30:35.499
less than the node key.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19864-0
01:30:35.969 --> 01:30:39.766
The right subtree of a node
contains nodes with greater than

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19864-1
01:30:39.766 --> 01:30:40.139
right.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19887-0
01:30:40.209 --> 01:30:43.009
Both the left and right subtrees
must also be BST and so on.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19898-0
01:30:43.239 --> 01:30:44.129
Let's take this example.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19920-0
01:30:45.369 --> 01:30:48.742
As is root for root alone, if
you see all the elements to its

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19920-1
01:30:48.742 --> 01:30:50.429
left will be smaller than that.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19929-0
01:30:50.889 --> 01:30:53.189
All the elements in the right
will be greater than that.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19949-0
01:30:55.069 --> 01:30:58.656
Many textbooks would depict that
BST cannot have duplicates,

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19949-1
01:30:58.656 --> 01:31:00.009
right meaning equal to?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19957-0
01:31:00.059 --> 01:31:01.809
What if we know I have duplicate
numbers?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19964-0
01:31:01.819 --> 01:31:02.509
How do I put it?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19979-0
01:31:02.759 --> 01:31:06.642
They will not allow BST to have
duplicates in many real life

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19979-1
01:31:06.642 --> 01:31:07.469
applications.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19992-0
01:31:07.479 --> 01:31:11.717
Also, we don't allow duplicates,
but there is still a

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/19992-1
01:31:11.717 --> 01:31:12.659
possibility.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20015-0
01:31:12.929 --> 01:31:16.951
Yeah, I would recommend you to
read CRS book and even in one of

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20015-1
01:31:16.951 --> 01:31:18.899
my slides I'll show an example.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20041-0
01:31:19.309 --> 01:31:22.884
If you tweak this definition a
little, if you allow duplicate

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20041-1
01:31:22.884 --> 01:31:26.229
then that'll come either to the
left or the right, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20063-0
01:31:26.239 --> 01:31:30.773
We will see when the time comes,
but in general BST will not

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20063-1
01:31:30.773 --> 01:31:32.929
allow duplicates or equal to.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20083-0
01:31:33.479 --> 01:31:37.130
It is strictly all elements left
will have smaller and right will

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20083-1
01:31:37.130 --> 01:31:37.739
be greater.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20086-0
01:31:38.799 --> 01:31:39.279
Is it clear?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20094-0
01:31:39.299 --> 01:31:40.819
Base all of you the BST
property.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20096-0
01:31:43.059 --> 01:31:43.219
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20099-0
01:31:44.989 --> 01:31:45.279
Yes.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20104-0
01:31:45.289 --> 01:31:47.039
No, maybe I don't see any
responses.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20114-0
01:31:50.409 --> 01:31:51.419
But consider this tree.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20123-0
01:31:51.889 --> 01:31:53.149
First of all, is it a binary
tree?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20148-0
01:31:53.929 --> 01:31:57.154
If it is not a binary tree right
away, you will tell no, this is

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20148-1
01:31:57.154 --> 01:31:59.039
not BS, because it's not even
binary.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20154-0
01:31:59.429 --> 01:32:00.239
So this is binary.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20166-0
01:32:00.249 --> 01:32:02.529
All of them have only two node,
three and four.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20197-0
01:32:03.329 --> 01:32:07.741
If you consider now 425, all of
them are smaller than this

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20197-1
01:32:07.741 --> 01:32:11.929
seven, so it is in the left nine
is greater than seven.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20213-0
01:32:11.939 --> 01:32:16.113
So it isn't the right perfect,
but for 9 it is a leaf no

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20213-1
01:32:16.113 --> 01:32:16.699
problem.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20222-0
01:32:16.779 --> 01:32:19.049
Leaves are no problem for this
internal node.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20236-0
01:32:19.649 --> 01:32:21.839
Two is smaller than four, so it
is in the left side.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20254-0
01:32:22.369 --> 01:32:26.007
Five is greater than four, so it
is in the right side, so this is

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20254-1
01:32:26.007 --> 01:32:26.669
a valid BST.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20259-0
01:32:28.029 --> 01:32:28.779
What about this one?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20274-0
01:32:30.859 --> 01:32:34.109
Yeah, one is smaller than three,
so it is left no problem.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20287-0
01:32:34.169 --> 01:32:36.679
Six is greater than three no
problem, but two is a problem.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20310-0
01:32:37.429 --> 01:32:41.898
Two is smaller than three, but
it is coming to the right side

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20310-1
01:32:41.898 --> 01:32:43.989
of three, so it is not a BST.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20319-0
01:32:45.439 --> 01:32:47.549
Right, so far, so good.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20321-0
01:32:47.559 --> 01:32:47.889
All of you.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20329-0
01:32:49.049 --> 01:32:52.099
What about these 618?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20350-0
01:32:52.109 --> 01:32:55.838
All of them are smaller than 10,
so it is coming to left side

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20350-1
01:32:55.838 --> 01:32:56.259
131114.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20365-0
01:32:56.269 --> 01:32:58.659
All of them are greater than 10,
so it is having to write side.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20388-0
01:32:59.069 --> 01:33:02.575
Similarly for this 1311 is
smaller so it is in left 14 is

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20388-1
01:33:02.575 --> 01:33:03.059
greater.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20393-0
01:33:03.069 --> 01:33:03.859
So it isn't right.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20406-0
01:33:04.289 --> 01:33:08.107
One is smaller than six and
eight is greater than six, so

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20406-1
01:33:08.107 --> 01:33:08.699
all good.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20421-0
01:33:09.049 --> 01:33:13.529
So it is a BST, but for this one
right for this one.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20440-0
01:33:14.479 --> 01:33:18.593
Well, is greater than 10, but it
is coming to the left side of

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20440-1
01:33:18.593 --> 01:33:18.789
10.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20447-0
01:33:19.489 --> 01:33:20.159
But there is a problem.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20457-0
01:33:20.819 --> 01:33:21.939
There's one more problem here.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20470-0
01:33:21.949 --> 01:33:25.389
At 99, is smaller than 10, but
it is coming to the right side.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20481-0
01:33:25.599 --> 01:33:28.249
So problem even if there is one
problem somewhere.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20494-0
01:33:28.579 --> 01:33:31.689
Yeah, you can immediately tell
that this is not a BST.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20502-0
01:33:33.079 --> 01:33:34.379
Yeah, so far, so good, all of
you.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20507-0
01:33:36.619 --> 01:33:37.129
Yes, no.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20530-0
01:33:37.139 --> 01:33:40.677
If a tree is given, Amit and
others, will you all be able to

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20530-1
01:33:40.677 --> 01:33:42.649
figure out if it is a BST or
not?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20548-0
01:33:43.349 --> 01:33:46.391
But every internal node you will
check left side should be

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20548-1
01:33:46.391 --> 01:33:47.319
smaller than that.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20556-0
01:33:47.849 --> 01:33:49.559
Right side should be greater
than that.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20569-0
01:33:49.749 --> 01:33:52.299
If this property is obeyed, then
it is a BST.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20573-0
01:33:52.689 --> 01:33:54.119
Otherwise it is not a BST.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20598-0
01:33:56.069 --> 01:33:59.149
As I told BST with duplicate
keys is also possible, but

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20598-1
01:33:59.149 --> 01:34:02.119
you'll have to change the
definition itself a little.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20609-0
01:34:02.589 --> 01:34:04.439
Let X be a node in a binary
search tree.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20637-0
01:34:04.689 --> 01:34:08.190
If Y is a node in the left
subtree of X, then Y dot key is

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20637-1
01:34:08.190 --> 01:34:10.089
less than or equal to X dot key.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20663-0
01:34:11.439 --> 01:34:14.571
If Y is a node in the right
subtree of X, then X dot key is

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20663-1
01:34:14.571 --> 01:34:16.189
greater than or equal to X dot.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20675-0
01:34:16.309 --> 01:34:19.739
So the definition itself you are
including the equal to right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20689-0
01:34:19.749 --> 01:34:22.589
So if you see here for six, all
these are smaller.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20698-0
01:34:22.599 --> 01:34:24.439
These are greater for this five.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20724-0
01:34:24.779 --> 01:34:28.700
There is another five here, but
by definition now this Y dot key

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20724-1
01:34:28.700 --> 01:34:32.379
which is in the right side is
greater than or equal to this.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20748-0
01:34:32.389 --> 01:34:36.069
Why so now this is fine, so
explicitly if you modify the

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20748-1
01:34:36.069 --> 01:34:39.879
definition to include duplicate
key then this is possible.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20757-0
01:34:40.449 --> 01:34:44.469
Otherwise, in general duplicates
is not allowed, yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20760-0
01:34:46.569 --> 01:34:47.059
Tradition.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20767-0
01:34:47.069 --> 01:34:48.299
Others were discussing in the
chat.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20774-0
01:34:48.309 --> 01:34:48.729
Very good.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20793-0
01:34:49.899 --> 01:34:54.684
An inorder traversal of a binary
search tree will give us a

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20793-1
01:34:54.684 --> 01:34:56.359
sorted output, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20820-0
01:34:56.369 --> 01:34:59.839
So if you have a tree like this,
this is a BST, correct one is

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20820-1
01:34:59.839 --> 01:35:02.979
smaller than two, so it's left
four is greater than two.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20827-0
01:35:02.989 --> 01:35:03.559
It's in right.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20834-0
01:35:03.909 --> 01:35:05.679
All these three are smaller than
six.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20841-0
01:35:05.819 --> 01:35:07.199
These two are greater than six.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20844-0
01:35:07.449 --> 01:35:07.759
Perfect.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20870-0
01:35:07.769 --> 01:35:12.436
This is a BST, so now if you do
a in order traversal that is

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20870-1
01:35:12.436 --> 01:35:14.119
124689 that is sorted.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20880-0
01:35:16.389 --> 01:35:16.549
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20883-0
01:35:16.929 --> 01:35:18.439
So can you go to the previous
slide please?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20888-0
01:35:19.019 --> 01:35:19.179
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20890-0
01:35:20.309 --> 01:35:20.679
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20915-0
01:35:20.689 --> 01:35:24.429
In this one where five is
duplicated, the below 15 which

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20904-0
01:35:23.089 --> 01:35:23.349
Correct.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20915-1
01:35:24.429 --> 01:35:27.579
is there left node we cannot
have at all right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20928-0
01:35:27.969 --> 01:35:31.039
Because it will violate that
poor, we cannot have three.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20962-0
01:35:31.049 --> 01:35:35.583
We cannot have because it will
violate the above 15 which is

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20962-1
01:35:35.583 --> 01:35:38.779
there left, right side, greater
than five.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20957-0
01:35:37.969 --> 01:35:39.819
No greater than we can have,
right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20981-0
01:35:40.009 --> 01:35:41.249
We can have something like say.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20973-0
01:35:40.279 --> 01:35:41.529
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20979-0
01:35:41.539 --> 01:35:42.249
I mean left.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20990-0
01:35:42.259 --> 01:35:43.129
We cannot have anything.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20986-0
01:35:43.209 --> 01:35:43.539
Correct.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20991-0
01:35:43.549 --> 01:35:44.389
That should go here.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/20997-0
01:35:44.829 --> 01:35:45.789
Yeah, that should go here.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21008-0
01:35:46.549 --> 01:35:47.319
Something like here.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21024-0
01:35:49.149 --> 01:35:51.319
I mean lift, lift, lift.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21020-0
01:35:49.169 --> 01:35:51.379
If you have modified the
definitions, no.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21036-0
01:35:51.329 --> 01:35:52.259
Childish blocked, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21030-0
01:35:51.389 --> 01:35:52.199
Let's take a number.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21038-0
01:35:52.669 --> 01:35:53.529
Yeah, let's take a number.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21048-0
01:35:54.419 --> 01:35:55.729
What number do you want to
insert now?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21050-0
01:35:57.549 --> 01:35:57.779
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21065-0
01:35:57.789 --> 01:35:58.689
Do you want to insert 3?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21081-0
01:35:57.809 --> 01:36:01.669
I mean live child will be
blocked right below 5.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21066-0
01:35:58.559 --> 01:35:58.699
What?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21090-0
01:36:01.479 --> 01:36:02.429
The why will it be blocked?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21104-0
01:36:01.679 --> 01:36:02.649
Is there left check?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21094-0
01:36:03.119 --> 01:36:03.349
No.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21098-0
01:36:03.359 --> 01:36:03.809
Take a number.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21113-0
01:36:03.819 --> 01:36:05.579
Do you want to insert three or
what do you want to insert?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21122-0
01:36:07.139 --> 01:36:07.349
Or.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21127-0
01:36:07.499 --> 01:36:10.069
Said, what about the secondary?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21130-0
01:36:08.739 --> 01:36:09.329
Let's say 4.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21136-0
01:36:10.139 --> 01:36:10.939
The B tree.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21154-0
01:36:11.749 --> 01:36:15.139
Here also it's same no five is
there so five is in the right

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21154-1
01:36:15.139 --> 01:36:16.139
side of this five.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21176-0
01:36:16.529 --> 01:36:19.682
But by definition you are
allowing this equal to, so it it

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21176-1
01:36:19.682 --> 01:36:21.819
was fine, but it is still a BST,
right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21199-0
01:36:22.469 --> 01:36:25.308
Five is greater than two, so
it's in right side 768 to all of

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21199-1
01:36:25.308 --> 01:36:26.499
them are greater than two.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21234-0
01:36:26.509 --> 01:36:30.555
It's in the right side for 765
are smaller and this eight is

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21234-1
01:36:30.555 --> 01:36:34.801
greater, but still this five is
in the right side of this file,

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21234-2
01:36:34.801 --> 01:36:35.199
right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21265-0
01:36:35.349 --> 01:36:38.604
By definition, this five can be
greater than or equal to this

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21265-1
01:36:38.604 --> 01:36:41.859
five, so it's OK and here if you
see if you want to insert 4.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21280-0
01:36:42.979 --> 01:36:45.929
So for this smaller than six, so
it should come to the left side.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21294-0
01:36:46.019 --> 01:36:48.934
Four is smaller than this five,
so it should come to the left

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21294-1
01:36:48.934 --> 01:36:49.169
side.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21309-0
01:36:49.639 --> 01:36:52.099
Four is greater than this too,
so it should come to this side.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21318-0
01:36:54.059 --> 01:36:54.809
This is wrong.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21330-0
01:36:54.879 --> 01:36:56.469
Or is it right, Vinay?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21328-0
01:36:54.899 --> 01:36:56.029
OK, got it.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21337-0
01:36:56.529 --> 01:36:57.109
Got it, Sir.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21335-0
01:36:56.539 --> 01:36:57.009
Yeah, got it.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21338-0
01:36:57.019 --> 01:36:57.289
Right.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21341-0
01:36:57.799 --> 01:36:57.959
Cool.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21352-0
01:36:59.089 --> 01:37:01.299
BHAT can be considered as binary
tree D.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21360-0
01:37:01.509 --> 01:37:02.939
Or is this not an?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21364-0
01:37:02.949 --> 01:37:04.099
It is an ADT right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21377-0
01:37:04.109 --> 01:37:06.499
It is an abstract data type just
like stack or queue.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21391-0
01:37:06.609 --> 01:37:09.937
You are only creating it using
some properties, so it is an

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21391-1
01:37:09.937 --> 01:37:10.159
ADT.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21414-0
01:37:11.909 --> 01:37:16.525
It says suppose uh in 3A, can
you please go back uh, if

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21411-0
01:37:15.559 --> 01:37:15.739
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21414-1
01:37:16.525 --> 01:37:17.349
available.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21424-0
01:37:17.359 --> 01:37:19.729
The five is written the Note 5.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21433-0
01:37:19.139 --> 01:37:19.299
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21440-0
01:37:19.879 --> 01:37:22.349
If there is 4, if there is 4.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21435-0
01:37:21.639 --> 01:37:21.839
Uh-huh.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21456-0
01:37:22.909 --> 01:37:24.959
This one or this one the top
one?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21450-0
01:37:24.659 --> 01:37:25.389
Uh, no.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21469-0
01:37:25.399 --> 01:37:26.999
The above 1 level one.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21467-0
01:37:26.689 --> 01:37:27.159
This one.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21475-0
01:37:27.649 --> 01:37:29.429
OK here I change it to four, OK.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21478-0
01:37:28.009 --> 01:37:30.429
Uh, yeah, uh, it is full.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21494-0
01:37:30.649 --> 01:37:35.989
And I suppose again, the phone
will come, then it will go to.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21498-0
01:37:36.989 --> 01:37:37.549
This is the.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21502-0
01:37:37.599 --> 01:37:38.709
This is the tree.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21512-0
01:37:38.719 --> 01:37:42.139
Now suppose if four will come
again.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21509-0
01:37:39.609 --> 01:37:39.859
Correct.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21520-0
01:37:41.919 --> 01:37:42.159
Again.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21521-0
01:37:42.289 --> 01:37:43.419
So where it will go?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21531-0
01:37:43.469 --> 01:37:46.459
It will go in the left of my.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21543-0
01:37:47.509 --> 01:37:50.489
Go for a smaller than six so you
come to the left side.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21550-0
01:37:50.689 --> 01:37:52.579
Four is equal to 4, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21558-0
01:37:52.629 --> 01:37:53.579
So there is a problem now.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21564-0
01:37:53.119 --> 01:37:53.259
Yes.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21585-0
01:37:53.629 --> 01:37:56.719
Either you can put in left or in
right, because in both the side

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21585-1
01:37:56.719 --> 01:37:58.859
you have now added this equal to
definition.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21613-0
01:37:59.449 --> 01:38:02.281
So either if you go to the left
side, you will go to two, four

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21613-1
01:38:02.281 --> 01:38:04.349
is greater than two, so you will
put it here.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21632-0
01:38:05.079 --> 01:38:08.772
That is one way or the other way
you could have gone to five and

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21632-1
01:38:08.772 --> 01:38:10.249
four is smaller than five.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21639-0
01:38:10.259 --> 01:38:11.079
So you would have food here.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21661-0
01:38:12.089 --> 01:38:16.150
Both of them are correct because
by definition you have included

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21661-1
01:38:16.150 --> 01:38:18.649
that equal to in both the sides,
right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21659-0
01:38:19.129 --> 01:38:19.799
OK.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21662-0
01:38:19.809 --> 01:38:20.259
OK.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21673-0
01:38:20.269 --> 01:38:20.529
OK.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21687-0
01:38:21.479 --> 01:38:23.349
The bold side, we can put. Uh.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21670-0
01:38:21.609 --> 01:38:21.859
Right.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21682-0
01:38:21.869 --> 01:38:23.159
Either you could have food here.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21684-0
01:38:23.449 --> 01:38:23.719
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21688-0
01:38:23.729 --> 01:38:24.549
Here or here.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21718-0
01:38:27.049 --> 01:38:32.442
Some we want to insert a six in
a then a insert it into the left

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21702-0
01:38:27.359 --> 01:38:27.519
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21718-1
01:38:32.442 --> 01:38:33.189
of seven.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21724-0
01:38:33.199 --> 01:38:35.179
Or will I check with the five?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21733-0
01:38:36.539 --> 01:38:38.189
Yeah, it is either approach.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21739-0
01:38:38.199 --> 01:38:39.789
Either you could have had here.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21747-0
01:38:41.649 --> 01:38:43.219
Yeah, this is also correct.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21752-0
01:38:43.269 --> 01:38:44.339
Or you could have put here.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21756-0
01:38:45.759 --> 01:38:45.989
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21780-0
01:38:45.999 --> 01:38:50.628
One of them you can choose, but
that is why again, 99% of BST

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21768-0
01:38:47.769 --> 01:38:48.049
OK.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21780-1
01:38:50.628 --> 01:38:53.539
applications will not allow
duplicate.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21802-0
01:38:54.079 --> 01:38:57.463
Yeah, in even in a lot of books,
you might see that duplicate

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21802-1
01:38:57.463 --> 01:38:58.719
will not be encouraged.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21833-0
01:38:59.189 --> 01:39:02.749
But if you still want to apply,
yeah, you can actually tweak the

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21833-1
01:39:02.749 --> 01:39:05.815
definitions, but as you told
there are some ambiguities

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21833-2
01:39:05.815 --> 01:39:07.239
someone might put it here.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21851-0
01:39:07.249 --> 01:39:09.549
Someone might put it here, but
both are correct because by

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21851-1
01:39:09.549 --> 01:39:11.069
definition you have included
equal to.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21872-0
01:39:13.179 --> 01:39:16.759
Yeah, in our examples or in our
case is mostly will not use all

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21872-1
01:39:16.759 --> 01:39:17.039
this.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21876-0
01:39:17.049 --> 01:39:17.209
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21894-0
01:39:17.219 --> 01:39:20.040
We will not allow duplicates,
but I just wanted you to tell it

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21894-1
01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:21.159
that it's still possible.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21896-0
01:39:21.589 --> 01:39:21.789
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21910-0
01:39:21.799 --> 01:39:23.959
And your real life application
you're using some BST.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21919-0
01:39:24.009 --> 01:39:25.719
You have some streaming data
coming in.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21938-0
01:39:26.099 --> 01:39:28.954
There could be duplicates, so
you should not go with the

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21938-1
01:39:28.954 --> 01:39:31.659
general crowd telling no BST
doesn't allow duplicate.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21952-0
01:39:32.129 --> 01:39:34.557
Yeah, if you change the
definition a little, you can

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21952-1
01:39:34.557 --> 01:39:35.519
still accommodate it.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21954-0
01:39:36.859 --> 01:39:37.069
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21959-0
01:39:37.079 --> 01:39:37.719
Is that clear, guys?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21967-0
01:39:37.729 --> 01:39:39.359
This is more like an edge
condition, yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/21985-0
01:39:42.819 --> 01:39:44.699
Cool is the sorted property
clear for all of you.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22011-0
01:39:45.739 --> 01:39:49.210
If there is a BST given to you
if you do a in order traversal,

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22011-1
01:39:49.210 --> 01:39:51.249
you'll get the output as a
sorted 1.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22014-0
01:39:53.829 --> 01:39:53.989
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22020-0
01:39:57.679 --> 01:39:58.869
Operations on BST.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22027-0
01:39:58.939 --> 01:39:59.599
What all can I do?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22044-0
01:40:00.829 --> 01:40:04.979
I can find some element in a BST
or I can find minimum.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22059-0
01:40:05.069 --> 01:40:08.399
I can find maximum in a BST or I
can insert some element.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22063-0
01:40:08.529 --> 01:40:09.439
I can delete something.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22071-0
01:40:10.069 --> 01:40:11.359
We'll have a quick look at
these.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22077-0
01:40:11.469 --> 01:40:12.399
I'll leave you free for the day.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22088-0
01:40:14.939 --> 01:40:17.009
Important notes on BST, yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22094-0
01:40:17.049 --> 01:40:17.919
So this is all fine.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22107-0
01:40:17.929 --> 01:40:20.749
This is all about complexity,
but let's first take an example.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22116-0
01:40:21.629 --> 01:40:22.919
There is a tree given like this.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22123-0
01:40:23.129 --> 01:40:24.499
I want to search or.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22147-0
01:40:24.509 --> 01:40:28.479
I want to find the element for
very important you will always

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22147-1
01:40:28.479 --> 01:40:32.449
start the search from the root
because this is a rooted tree.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22152-0
01:40:32.459 --> 01:40:33.709
This is not a graph, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22163-0
01:40:34.149 --> 01:40:36.249
So find operation is
straightforward in a BST.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22180-0
01:40:36.619 --> 01:40:40.236
Start with the root and keep
moving left or right using BST

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22180-1
01:40:40.236 --> 01:40:40.779
property.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22208-0
01:40:41.599 --> 01:40:44.325
If the node we are searching is
the same as nodes, then we

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22208-1
01:40:44.325 --> 01:40:46.589
return the current node, meaning
we have got it.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22221-0
01:40:46.939 --> 01:40:49.919
If the data is not present, we
will end up in a null link.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22224-0
01:40:50.849 --> 01:40:51.439
Let's start.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22245-0
01:40:51.569 --> 01:40:55.917
We want to search for 4/4 is
less than six, so you go to the

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22245-1
01:40:55.917 --> 01:40:57.129
left side, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22262-0
01:40:58.219 --> 01:41:01.282
You reach to four is greater
than two, so you go to the right

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22262-1
01:41:01.282 --> 01:41:01.529
side.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22271-0
01:41:01.779 --> 01:41:03.569
You got four for searches
successful.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22282-0
01:41:04.689 --> 01:41:08.169
So when you started here, 4 is
less than six.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22304-0
01:41:09.399 --> 01:41:12.777
So is there any way that four
can be there in the right side

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22304-1
01:41:12.777 --> 01:41:14.549
of this tree, right side of six?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22308-0
01:41:14.559 --> 01:41:15.049
Can it be there?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22314-0
01:41:17.069 --> 01:41:18.239
I've already given.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22317-0
01:41:17.109 --> 01:41:17.289
No.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22339-0
01:41:18.249 --> 01:41:22.304
I've declared that this is a
BST, so if at all four is there,

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22339-1
01:41:22.304 --> 01:41:24.789
it should be in the left side of
six.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22372-0
01:41:24.839 --> 01:41:29.974
It cannot be there in the right
side, so this whole part I am

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22372-1
01:41:29.974 --> 01:41:35.440
not searching or in other words,
this is a very important concept

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22372-2
01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:37.759
in computing called pruning.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22387-0
01:41:38.749 --> 01:41:42.287
I don't look at this at all
because I'm very confident if at

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22387-1
01:41:42.287 --> 01:41:42.519
all.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22393-0
01:41:42.529 --> 01:41:43.039
Four is there.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22400-0
01:41:43.049 --> 01:41:44.199
It should be there in the left
side.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22418-0
01:41:44.249 --> 01:41:47.731
It cannot be there in the right
side and I completely ignore the

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22418-1
01:41:47.731 --> 01:41:47.999
tree.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22428-0
01:41:48.169 --> 01:41:50.079
This could have been a very big
tree also right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22439-0
01:41:50.129 --> 01:41:52.579
All of them could have had
children's right.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22452-0
01:41:52.629 --> 01:41:57.529
I'm completely ignoring that, so
that is the benefit of this.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22469-0
01:41:57.979 --> 01:42:01.689
Let's say I want to search for
4141 is greater than six.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22476-0
01:42:01.759 --> 01:42:02.929
So what am I pruning here?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22481-0
01:42:03.039 --> 01:42:04.169
Which side am I pruning?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22488-0
01:42:07.399 --> 01:42:07.539
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22497-0
01:42:08.659 --> 01:42:09.219
They too.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22502-0
01:42:09.339 --> 01:42:09.829
Left side.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22507-0
01:42:09.589 --> 01:42:10.039
Steps.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22504-0
01:42:09.709 --> 01:42:10.339
Right side.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22526-0
01:42:10.529 --> 01:42:14.789
Let's say except for him Dev
set.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22515-0
01:42:10.649 --> 01:42:10.989
Silent.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22518-0
01:42:11.069 --> 01:42:12.019
Let's say pruning.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22521-0
01:42:11.909 --> 01:42:13.489
Which side am I pruning? Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22541-0
01:42:15.189 --> 01:42:17.109
File this whole side.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22559-0
01:42:16.959 --> 01:42:19.229
Say, let's say, let's say we
have PUNEET.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22554-0
01:42:19.649 --> 01:42:20.519
Yeah, we are pruning.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22585-0
01:42:20.589 --> 01:42:23.905
So for the one is greater than
six, I come here, 41 is greater

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22573-0
01:42:21.269 --> 01:42:21.649
Let's see.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22585-1
01:42:23.905 --> 01:42:26.799
than nine, but nine doesn't have
a right child at all.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22592-0
01:42:27.229 --> 01:42:28.009
Right, so here it is.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22596-0
01:42:28.019 --> 01:42:29.599
Null nothing is there.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22611-0
01:42:29.729 --> 01:42:33.902
So I can declare right away here
telling that 41 is not there,

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22611-1
01:42:33.902 --> 01:42:34.299
right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22641-0
01:42:34.829 --> 01:42:39.388
So what is the complexity then
in all these cases at every node

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22634-0
01:42:39.289 --> 01:42:39.679
Login.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22641-1
01:42:39.388 --> 01:42:41.169
I am discarding one side.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22649-0
01:42:41.339 --> 01:42:45.539
So this login, that is what
BSDCH promising is.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22659-0
01:42:45.549 --> 01:42:48.239
He's a very good guy, but he'll
be trace.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22662-0
01:42:48.609 --> 01:42:48.749
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22672-0
01:42:50.059 --> 01:42:51.899
Can someone confirm if this is a
BST or not?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22678-0
01:42:53.449 --> 01:42:54.459
20 is greater than 10.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22690-0
01:42:54.469 --> 01:42:56.319
It's in right side, the T is
greater than 20.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22707-0
01:42:56.329 --> 01:42:59.239
It's in right side 40 is greater
than 30, it's on right side.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22714-0
01:42:59.299 --> 01:43:01.479
So this is a perfectly valid
BST.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22777-0
01:43:03.249 --> 01:43:06.921
I want to search you 41 is there
or not 41 is greater than 10 so

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22777-1
01:43:06.921 --> 01:43:10.423
you have to write 41 is greater
than 20 you go to write 41 is

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22777-2
01:43:10.423 --> 01:43:14.039
greater than 30 you go to write
41 is greater than 40 but there

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22777-3
01:43:14.039 --> 01:43:14.999
is no right side.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22795-0
01:43:15.069 --> 01:43:18.914
So now you tell that 41 is not
there, but to tell 41 is not

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22795-1
01:43:18.914 --> 01:43:19.299
there.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22808-0
01:43:19.309 --> 01:43:20.569
How many nodes did you traverse?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22825-0
01:43:22.209 --> 01:43:24.209
Order of you in this in this
case.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22826-0
01:43:23.919 --> 01:43:24.989
All no and.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22828-0
01:43:25.749 --> 01:43:25.889
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22857-0
01:43:27.269 --> 01:43:32.591
So is the worst case complexity
of BST login or N if you tell

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22861-0
01:43:32.529 --> 01:43:32.859
And.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22857-1
01:43:32.591 --> 01:43:33.449
log north.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22868-0
01:43:33.409 --> 01:43:34.099
This is the end.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22882-0
01:43:33.809 --> 01:43:36.486
If you tell log in, I can always
draw BHAT like this and prove

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22882-1
01:43:36.486 --> 01:43:37.209
you that it is N.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22910-0
01:43:38.199 --> 01:43:42.874
So the St also bit readers, but
if you think deep about it, is

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22910-1
01:43:42.874 --> 01:43:47.698
it a problem of the BST or is it
that structure of the tree like

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22910-2
01:43:47.698 --> 01:43:48.069
this?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22920-0
01:43:48.279 --> 01:43:49.809
This is nothing like an array,
right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22933-0
01:43:49.929 --> 01:43:52.429
Because only in one side you
have, you cannot prune anything.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22944-0
01:43:52.839 --> 01:43:54.239
Everything is there only in One
Direction.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22954-0
01:43:55.349 --> 01:43:57.689
This type of tree is called as a
skewed tree.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22993-0
01:43:58.589 --> 01:44:01.598
You can have either left skewed
when you have a tree going like

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22993-1
01:44:01.598 --> 01:44:04.700
this, I mean right skewed or you
can have a left skewed like this

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22993-2
01:44:04.700 --> 01:44:06.769
where only in one side the tree
is growing.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/22995-0
01:44:07.759 --> 01:44:07.889
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23007-0
01:44:08.969 --> 01:44:11.169
So this is a problem with the
structure.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23017-0
01:44:12.159 --> 01:44:14.579
Yeah, skewness is a problem.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23037-0
01:44:14.649 --> 01:44:18.790
If you have skewed Ness, a
skewed tree, is it a linear data

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23037-1
01:44:18.790 --> 01:44:21.619
structure or a nonlinear data
structure?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23060-0
01:44:23.989 --> 01:44:26.555
If it is only going in One
Direction like this, then it is

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23056-0
01:44:24.659 --> 01:44:25.039
Linear.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23060-1
01:44:26.555 --> 01:44:26.859
linear.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23077-0
01:44:27.049 --> 01:44:30.097
Then it is like an array, only
then complexity is nothing but

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23069-0
01:44:27.639 --> 01:44:27.799
It's.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23077-1
01:44:30.097 --> 01:44:30.539
we go up.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23080-0
01:44:30.549 --> 01:44:32.159
Yeah, correct.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23082-0
01:44:32.169 --> 01:44:32.479
Right.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23091-0
01:44:32.889 --> 01:44:34.479
So you are not even having a
tree.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23124-0
01:44:34.719 --> 01:44:37.783
This is a tree, but this is like
there's also a tree, but if you

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23124-1
01:44:37.783 --> 01:44:40.799
go deep into that concept only
in One Direction, it is growing.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23144-0
01:44:40.809 --> 01:44:44.612
So the link list will be just
one side, so this is a big off

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23144-1
01:44:44.612 --> 01:44:45.609
then complexity.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23153-0
01:44:46.949 --> 01:44:48.109
So what is the crux of it?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23160-0
01:44:48.989 --> 01:44:50.219
BST is a good friend.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23167-0
01:44:50.529 --> 01:44:51.959
He somehow tried to help us.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23202-0
01:44:51.969 --> 01:44:55.586
He tried to get as a complexity
of log in which neither array

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23202-1
01:44:55.586 --> 01:44:58.269
stack Q3 graph run of them were
able to give.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23226-0
01:44:58.919 --> 01:45:02.521
Somehow he gave a promising
concept that put all the smaller

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23226-1
01:45:02.521 --> 01:45:05.179
ones to the left, greater ones
to the right.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23270-0
01:45:05.939 --> 01:45:09.634
In that way, you'll be able to
prune when you are searching one

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23270-1
01:45:09.634 --> 01:45:13.040
side, so you'll get a complexity
of log in, but still this

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23270-2
01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:16.504
notorious guys skewed tree
spoiled the complete concept, so

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23270-3
01:45:16.504 --> 01:45:18.929
the BST complexity is still big
of north.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23272-0
01:45:20.459 --> 01:45:20.869
Great.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23280-0
01:45:21.279 --> 01:45:22.669
So how to tackle this?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23287-0
01:45:23.119 --> 01:45:24.369
That is for a later class.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23295-0
01:45:24.379 --> 01:45:27.439
That is what the scientists ABL
did.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23307-0
01:45:28.399 --> 01:45:29.849
Yeah, you learn about it later.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23314-0
01:45:31.359 --> 01:45:33.129
So for now finding, yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23312-0
01:45:31.819 --> 01:45:32.439
So one thing.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23320-0
01:45:34.999 --> 01:45:35.309
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23328-0
01:45:35.059 --> 01:45:35.359
Go ahead.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23342-0
01:45:35.319 --> 01:45:40.172
If we have a leaf on the skewed
tree also it is called as an as

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23342-1
01:45:40.172 --> 01:45:40.399
Q3.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23349-0
01:45:40.409 --> 01:45:41.959
For example, we have 20.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23353-0
01:45:42.859 --> 01:45:45.529
We have something like 19.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23395-0
01:45:46.699 --> 01:45:52.292
OK, so where will so 19 is
greater than 10, so it will come

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23362-0
01:45:48.099 --> 01:45:48.919
We will have it.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23366-0
01:45:49.699 --> 01:45:50.049
We will.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23376-0
01:45:50.059 --> 01:45:50.779
It will come, you know.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23395-1
01:45:52.292 --> 01:45:54.809
here 19 is smaller than 20.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23394-0
01:45:52.829 --> 01:45:53.289
Yeah, I think.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23411-0
01:45:54.819 --> 01:45:56.899
So it will come here, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23422-0
01:45:56.969 --> 01:45:58.709
Yeah, this is also called as a
skewed tree.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23433-0
01:45:58.449 --> 01:46:01.186
Yeah, this is also stupid
because in this side it's

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23433-1
01:46:01.186 --> 01:46:03.239
already growing way too higher,
right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23456-0
01:46:03.589 --> 01:46:06.138
If some other nodes are just
added here, then it is again

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23447-0
01:46:03.769 --> 01:46:04.109
OK.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23456-1
01:46:06.138 --> 01:46:06.929
skewed only right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23465-0
01:46:07.959 --> 01:46:08.559
Cool, thank.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23463-0
01:46:08.319 --> 01:46:09.589
So cuteness is just a concept.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23476-0
01:46:09.599 --> 01:46:13.789
It means you are three is
heavily loaded on One Direction.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23482-0
01:46:14.349 --> 01:46:16.589
Yeah, that is the case.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23497-0
01:46:16.599 --> 01:46:18.029
Then you can call it as as Q3.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23541-0
01:46:19.289 --> 01:46:22.604
So just for an and things like
in the article or like in there

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23541-1
01:46:22.604 --> 01:46:25.761
any databases we are having
their binary tree indexes right

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23545-0
01:46:25.489 --> 01:46:26.119
P3 yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23541-2
01:46:25.761 --> 01:46:26.919
whenever we are, yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23572-0
01:46:27.029 --> 01:46:30.544
Whenever we are inserting the
records, the one to three, the

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23565-0
01:46:29.359 --> 01:46:31.109
Umm. Correct.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23572-1
01:46:30.544 --> 01:46:34.059
primary or something then first
it will be created as queue.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23576-0
01:46:34.069 --> 01:46:34.529
Retry right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23595-0
01:46:36.069 --> 01:46:40.215
Yes, but internally it will
rearrange itself to be a big

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23595-1
01:46:40.215 --> 01:46:40.579
tree.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23602-0
01:46:40.309 --> 01:46:40.639
OK.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23603-0
01:46:41.249 --> 01:46:42.409
Yeah, that's a different
concept.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23612-0
01:46:42.419 --> 01:46:43.719
There is something called as B
tree.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23622-0
01:46:43.729 --> 01:46:46.159
There is something called as B
plus tree, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23666-0
01:46:46.169 --> 01:46:49.777
All of them, but fundamentally
they all work on this principle

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23666-1
01:46:49.777 --> 01:46:53.327
of BSD, but you'll understand
more about it once we learn AVL

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23666-2
01:46:53.327 --> 01:46:56.648
and in all that, yeah, school is
inclined towards any One

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23666-3
01:46:56.648 --> 01:46:57.679
Direction perfect.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23678-0
01:46:57.689 --> 01:47:00.397
If it's right side, then it's a
right skewed tree which left

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23678-1
01:47:00.397 --> 01:47:00.619
side.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23685-0
01:47:00.629 --> 01:47:01.579
It's a left skewed tree.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23705-0
01:47:02.659 --> 01:47:05.039
How do you quickly search here
through to itself?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23718-0
01:47:05.049 --> 01:47:08.088
Is null return null because
there's nothing if the data that

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23718-1
01:47:08.088 --> 01:47:10.479
you are looking for is less than
the root data.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23723-0
01:47:10.529 --> 01:47:11.569
Which side you should search?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23727-0
01:47:14.329 --> 01:47:14.489
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23771-0
01:47:16.189 --> 01:47:19.697
Which side should so it's left
side right data is less so you

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23749-0
01:47:18.289 --> 01:47:18.619
Looks like.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23771-1
01:47:19.697 --> 01:47:23.318
will search in the left side if
data is greater than root data,

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23771-2
01:47:23.318 --> 01:47:25.129
you'll search in the right side.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23783-0
01:47:25.379 --> 01:47:27.029
So what type of an algorithm is
this?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23808-0
01:47:27.559 --> 01:47:31.261
Find is the method name again
and again you are using find but

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23808-1
01:47:31.261 --> 01:47:33.259
you are altering this part
alone.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23813-0
01:47:33.199 --> 01:47:33.759
This action.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23810-0
01:47:34.569 --> 01:47:34.979
Perfect.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23815-0
01:47:34.989 --> 01:47:35.799
Yeah, this is recursion.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23828-0
01:47:37.759 --> 01:47:40.169
Where will be the minimum in a
BST.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23833-0
01:47:40.919 --> 01:47:41.859
Can someone quickly tell that?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23844-0
01:47:43.719 --> 01:47:44.229
Lived most.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23846-0
01:47:44.829 --> 01:47:45.379
Leftmost.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23854-0
01:47:45.229 --> 01:47:49.239
Yeah, left most leaf node
correct.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23848-0
01:47:45.639 --> 01:47:46.219
Lift.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23883-0
01:47:49.649 --> 01:47:53.122
So if you put this definition in
a BST, the minimum element is

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23883-1
01:47:53.122 --> 01:47:56.099
the left most node, which does
not have a left child.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23913-0
01:47:56.489 --> 01:47:59.497
So in this BST you go to left
you go to left, four is the

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23913-1
01:47:59.497 --> 01:48:01.779
leftmost guy who doesn't have a
left child.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23922-0
01:48:01.849 --> 01:48:05.089
So he's the minimum in this
whole tree, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23938-0
01:48:05.239 --> 01:48:09.144
So how will the code look like
play left of X is not equal to

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23938-1
01:48:09.144 --> 01:48:09.459
null.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23942-0
01:48:09.469 --> 01:48:09.999
Keep going.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23953-0
01:48:10.369 --> 01:48:12.179
Ultimately, you will fail from
this while loop.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23958-0
01:48:12.189 --> 01:48:13.539
That is the answer, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23968-0
01:48:13.549 --> 01:48:14.639
Keep going in the left side.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23973-0
01:48:15.569 --> 01:48:17.279
Again, complexities big of yen.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23975-0
01:48:17.289 --> 01:48:17.399
Why?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23983-0
01:48:18.579 --> 01:48:19.869
Why is it then and not log in?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23985-0
01:48:23.029 --> 01:48:23.169
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24000-0
01:48:25.949 --> 01:48:26.659
Cute dreams.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23998-0
01:48:26.019 --> 01:48:26.439
Skilled.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/23996-0
01:48:27.109 --> 01:48:27.639
Exactly.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24026-0
01:48:27.649 --> 01:48:32.033
If you have a left skewed tree
like this, then this guy is the

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24026-1
01:48:32.033 --> 01:48:35.999
minimum and you would have spent
big of yen to go there.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24035-0
01:48:37.419 --> 01:48:39.629
What about the maximum element
in a BST?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24039-0
01:48:39.639 --> 01:48:40.239
Where will that be?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24055-0
01:48:42.479 --> 01:48:43.089
The right most.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24057-0
01:48:42.639 --> 01:48:43.529
Right, right.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24064-0
01:48:44.169 --> 01:48:44.949
Drive most.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24079-0
01:48:44.319 --> 01:48:49.001
The right most node who doesn't
have a right child, correct this

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24075-0
01:48:47.059 --> 01:48:47.969
Which might do it there.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24079-1
01:48:49.001 --> 01:48:49.289
one.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24096-0
01:48:50.489 --> 01:48:54.689
So 16 doesn't have a ichill, so
these the largest.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24123-0
01:48:54.959 --> 01:48:59.090
So right most node which does
not have a right child is the

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24123-1
01:48:59.090 --> 01:49:03.289
largest until the right most
node doesn't have a right node.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24132-0
01:49:03.299 --> 01:49:04.469
Keep doing in a while loop.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24149-0
01:49:04.539 --> 01:49:07.547
Once you hit the while loop,
it's you know you cannot go

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24149-1
01:49:07.547 --> 01:49:07.969
further.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24165-0
01:49:07.979 --> 01:49:11.499
That is answer again because of
skewness, we go forth is there

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24165-1
01:49:11.499 --> 01:49:12.449
right complexity?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24169-0
01:49:14.309 --> 01:49:14.499
Cool.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24172-0
01:49:15.689 --> 01:49:15.899
Don't.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24189-0
01:49:15.909 --> 01:49:19.554
There is this very small concept
called in order predecessor and

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24189-1
01:49:19.554 --> 01:49:20.619
in order successor.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24192-0
01:49:20.789 --> 01:49:20.969
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24195-0
01:49:20.979 --> 01:49:21.619
What is this?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24201-0
01:49:22.509 --> 01:49:25.329
Yeah, let's take this particular
3.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24219-0
01:49:27.019 --> 01:49:30.741
So whatever I am highlighting,
can you comment about those

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24219-1
01:49:30.741 --> 01:49:32.129
nodes relation with X?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24233-0
01:49:32.929 --> 01:49:35.269
Will there be greater than X or
will they be smaller than X?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24248-0
01:49:36.979 --> 01:49:37.779
Get at the next.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24247-0
01:49:37.279 --> 01:49:37.799
Greater than.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24272-0
01:49:37.319 --> 01:49:43.044
Whatever I greater than cool and
in the left side, all this will

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24267-0
01:49:42.209 --> 01:49:42.589
Smaller.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24272-1
01:49:43.044 --> 01:49:44.629
be smaller than X.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24269-0
01:49:43.329 --> 01:49:43.849
Smaller than.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24294-0
01:49:45.809 --> 01:49:50.813
With that being said, if you
pick this node X for X, you can

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24294-1
01:49:50.813 --> 01:49:51.879
find 2 words.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24301-0
01:49:51.929 --> 01:49:54.789
One is the predecessor of him.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24307-0
01:49:54.839 --> 01:49:56.389
One is the successor of him.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24311-0
01:49:56.439 --> 01:49:56.969
What are those?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24317-0
01:49:58.349 --> 01:50:01.859
Yeah, the predecessor
predecessor node.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24320-0
01:50:02.009 --> 01:50:02.179
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24323-0
01:50:02.189 --> 01:50:02.539
What is that?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24336-0
01:50:03.899 --> 01:50:07.349
The predecessor node of this is
in the left side.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24356-0
01:50:07.399 --> 01:50:10.523
All of them are smaller, but in
that there will be a largest

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24356-1
01:50:10.523 --> 01:50:11.189
way, correct.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24360-0
01:50:11.199 --> 01:50:11.849
We'll always be here.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24374-0
01:50:12.799 --> 01:50:16.449
The other in the left subtree of
X.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24389-0
01:50:16.499 --> 01:50:20.429
If you find the largest that is
called the predecessor of X.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24443-0
01:50:21.949 --> 01:50:25.270
Similarly, on the right side,
all the numbers are greater than

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24443-1
01:50:25.270 --> 01:50:28.381
X that I already know, but among
all those numbers who are

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24443-2
01:50:28.381 --> 01:50:31.491
greater than X, there will be a
smallest one right that is

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24443-3
01:50:31.491 --> 01:50:34.338
called that he'll always be
here, and he's called the

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24443-4
01:50:34.338 --> 01:50:35.129
successor of X.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24460-0
01:50:36.899 --> 01:50:40.759
Let's take this example for a 25
who is the predecessor.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24482-0
01:50:45.219 --> 01:50:45.619
Ring.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24501-0
01:50:45.669 --> 01:50:48.909
Smaller than 25 exactly among
them.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24567-0
01:50:45.699 --> 01:50:45.959
Yep.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24507-0
01:50:46.719 --> 01:50:46.929
20.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24508-0
01:50:47.769 --> 01:50:48.229
Good.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24509-0
01:50:48.919 --> 01:50:50.269
Who is the largest 20?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24536-0
01:50:50.399 --> 01:50:55.171
So he becomes the predecessor of
25, and in the right side all of

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24536-1
01:50:55.171 --> 01:50:56.979
them are greater than 25.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24557-0
01:50:57.529 --> 01:51:02.669
But in that, who's the smallest
out of 403545444935?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24559-0
01:51:00.629 --> 01:51:01.209
35.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24571-0
01:51:02.679 --> 01:51:06.499
That guy becomes the successor
of 25 guys.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24579-0
01:51:06.509 --> 01:51:08.889
This concept clear what is
predecessor and successor.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24606-0
01:51:10.919 --> 01:51:13.968
Predecessor is the maximum value
in the left sub tree and

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24606-1
01:51:13.968 --> 01:51:16.439
successor is the minimum in the
right subtree.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24621-0
01:51:17.259 --> 01:51:20.570
In normal English, also, if you
remember predecessor successor,

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24621-1
01:51:20.570 --> 01:51:22.019
that is what it means right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24635-0
01:51:22.029 --> 01:51:25.429
So 20 is preceding 25, so he's
the predecessor.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24643-0
01:51:25.899 --> 01:51:27.469
35 is greater than 25.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24665-0
01:51:27.479 --> 01:51:32.001
He's the first largest number
after 25, so he's the successor

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24665-1
01:51:32.001 --> 01:51:32.439
of 25.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24679-0
01:51:33.829 --> 01:51:36.436
Will you might be like, why
suddenly this we will use this

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24679-1
01:51:36.436 --> 01:51:37.099
sometime later.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24703-0
01:51:37.349 --> 01:51:40.756
That is why I also told this if
35 was in the place of 40 then

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24703-1
01:51:40.756 --> 01:51:42.379
yeah, then things will change.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24712-0
01:51:42.429 --> 01:51:43.659
But just remember this concept.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24718-0
01:51:44.809 --> 01:51:46.239
This guy will be the successor.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24733-0
01:51:46.249 --> 01:51:49.138
This guy will be the predecessor
if you alter the nodes, of

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24733-1
01:51:49.138 --> 01:51:50.919
course everything will change,
yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24744-0
01:51:53.899 --> 01:51:55.749
Well, let's try to do some
insertions.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24751-0
01:51:55.879 --> 01:51:57.669
Yeah, insertion in a BST.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24758-0
01:51:57.679 --> 01:51:58.889
How do you do finding?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24777-0
01:51:58.899 --> 01:52:01.706
Is it clear for all of you find
the minimum, find the maximum

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24777-1
01:52:01.706 --> 01:52:02.249
normal find?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24795-0
01:52:02.599 --> 01:52:06.617
Is it all clear and even is the
leftmost, which doesn't have a

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24795-1
01:52:06.617 --> 01:52:07.319
left child.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24809-0
01:52:07.549 --> 01:52:10.308
Maximum is right most, which
doesn't have a right child

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24809-1
01:52:10.308 --> 01:52:10.899
normal find.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24828-0
01:52:11.259 --> 01:52:15.003
You will keep pruning at every
decision node, but skewness

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24828-1
01:52:15.003 --> 01:52:16.399
spoil the whole sport.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24837-0
01:52:16.409 --> 01:52:18.109
He made the complexity of big of
north.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24861-0
01:52:18.899 --> 01:52:22.345
Now let's learn the normal
insertion insert key an element

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24861-1
01:52:22.345 --> 01:52:24.389
is there in a BST DNA at the
root.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24875-0
01:52:24.729 --> 01:52:27.059
Compare the element K with the
element at the current node.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24897-0
01:52:27.429 --> 01:52:29.943
If the value we want to insert
is less than the key of the

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24897-1
01:52:29.943 --> 01:52:31.179
current node, go to the left.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24928-0
01:52:31.549 --> 01:52:34.756
Another way is go to the right,
if we reach a null then create a

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24928-1
01:52:34.756 --> 01:52:37.519
node with the value we are
inserting and place it here.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24931-0
01:52:38.529 --> 01:52:38.989
Let's do it.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24942-0
01:52:40.989 --> 01:52:42.349
First thing first, is it a BST?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24957-0
01:52:44.789 --> 01:52:46.659
Real quick, is this a BST?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24963-0
01:52:47.289 --> 01:52:47.629
Yes, Sir.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24965-0
01:52:48.019 --> 01:52:48.179
Yes.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24966-0
01:52:48.739 --> 01:52:49.099
Yes, Sir.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24969-0
01:52:49.129 --> 01:52:49.339
You're.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24975-0
01:52:49.449 --> 01:52:51.939
OK, insert 35.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24987-0
01:52:51.949 --> 01:52:52.499
How do you do it?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25003-0
01:52:53.819 --> 01:52:57.759
35 is greater than 20, so go to
the right side.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/24997-0
01:52:53.829 --> 01:52:55.199
Will compare from 20.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25020-0
01:52:58.699 --> 01:53:02.449
35 is smaller than 40, so go to
the left side.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25015-0
01:53:00.209 --> 01:53:00.399
Right.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25048-0
01:53:03.109 --> 01:53:07.303
35 is greater than 30, so we
should come to the right side,

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25032-0
01:53:03.129 --> 01:53:03.399
It's.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25042-0
01:53:07.149 --> 01:53:07.409
Photo.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25048-1
01:53:07.303 --> 01:53:09.749
but 30 doesn't have a right
child.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25075-0
01:53:09.859 --> 01:53:14.292
So create a node, put 35 there,
add it to the right side of that

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25075-1
01:53:14.292 --> 01:53:16.679
you have inserted 35
successfully.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25078-0
01:53:17.839 --> 01:53:18.479
So far so good.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25080-0
01:53:20.149 --> 01:53:20.529
Yes, no.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25089-0
01:53:22.559 --> 01:53:23.549
Insert seven.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25094-0
01:53:24.009 --> 01:53:24.149
Yes.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25102-0
01:53:24.179 --> 01:53:28.999
Yeah, this is already a VST 7 is
less than 20.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25113-0
01:53:29.069 --> 01:53:31.619
Go to the left side seven is
less than 10.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25124-0
01:53:31.699 --> 01:53:34.779
Go to the left side seven is
greater than six.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25136-0
01:53:34.989 --> 01:53:36.939
Go to the right side is already
a node.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25148-0
01:53:36.949 --> 01:53:40.679
Here 7 is less than 8, but eight
doesn't have a left child.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25161-0
01:53:40.999 --> 01:53:44.019
So create a node with seven as
its value.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25173-0
01:53:44.169 --> 01:53:47.589
Add him as the left child of
seven left child of eight.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25183-0
01:53:49.419 --> 01:53:50.369
Insert successful.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25186-0
01:53:50.859 --> 01:53:52.179
Insert the element 18.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25189-0
01:53:53.139 --> 01:53:53.499
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25203-0
01:53:53.509 --> 01:53:54.739
Insert the element 18.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25242-0
01:53:53.899 --> 01:53:59.230
So when so one minute the 30 by
35 also can be inserted in on

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25221-0
01:53:55.109 --> 01:53:55.629
Yeah, go ahead.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25228-0
01:53:56.399 --> 01:53:57.479
15 right said.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25242-1
01:53:59.230 --> 01:54:02.239
the right side of 15 and 8,
right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25259-0
01:54:03.359 --> 01:54:06.349
Right away, start from the root
is 35 greater than 20.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25263-0
01:54:07.909 --> 01:54:08.279
Yes.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25268-0
01:54:07.969 --> 01:54:08.629
OK, OK.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25272-0
01:54:08.339 --> 01:54:11.669
So you cannot go to the left
completed.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25285-0
01:54:10.469 --> 01:54:12.629
OK. Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25289-0
01:54:11.739 --> 01:54:13.989
Yeah, the story always starts
from the root.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25295-0
01:54:14.279 --> 01:54:15.689
You're comparing their.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25302-0
01:54:15.859 --> 01:54:17.569
That is a decision point.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25327-0
01:54:17.579 --> 01:54:21.681
If 35 is greater than 20, there
is no way 35 can be in the left

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25327-1
01:54:21.681 --> 01:54:22.899
child of 20, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25334-0
01:54:22.909 --> 01:54:24.769
Then the whole BSD property is
violated, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25357-0
01:54:24.939 --> 01:54:28.561
If 35 is here, 35 is greater
than 20, but it's in the left

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25357-1
01:54:28.561 --> 01:54:28.929
child.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25378-0
01:54:29.079 --> 01:54:32.114
If you do that, this whole tree
will not be a BST anymore, so

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25378-1
01:54:32.114 --> 01:54:32.799
don't do that.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25409-0
01:54:33.679 --> 01:54:38.715
So when we when we look into uh
time complexity for insertion so

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25409-1
01:54:38.715 --> 01:54:43.209
in by two time will be in I mean
we need to shift in the.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25397-0
01:54:39.119 --> 01:54:39.259
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25422-0
01:54:43.279 --> 01:54:45.638
If we implement through the
array, then we need to shift

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25422-1
01:54:45.638 --> 01:54:46.259
each and every.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25426-0
01:54:46.559 --> 01:54:48.279
Uh ohh.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25437-0
01:54:48.479 --> 01:54:52.089
Element to the right side to the
subsequent index, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25474-0
01:54:52.099 --> 01:54:56.746
So it will be very, I mean
invite to like like it will be

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25474-1
01:54:56.746 --> 01:54:58.349
ON complexity right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25470-0
01:54:58.979 --> 01:54:59.189
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25476-0
01:54:59.199 --> 01:54:59.549
Correct.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25492-0
01:54:59.199 --> 01:55:00.869
Because shifting will be taking
time.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25489-0
01:54:59.679 --> 01:55:01.799
But but it is helping you later,
right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25507-0
01:55:02.019 --> 01:55:04.449
So when you want to search you
are able to prune something.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25511-0
01:55:04.599 --> 01:55:05.549
But yeah, you're right.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25517-0
01:55:05.149 --> 01:55:05.329
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25521-0
01:55:05.639 --> 01:55:07.769
Or the simplest argument I can
make is this.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25531-0
01:55:08.859 --> 01:55:11.069
What if I have elements like
this skewness?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25563-0
01:55:11.319 --> 01:55:13.655
So I'll have to keep inserting
if I want to insert another

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25547-0
01:55:11.869 --> 01:55:12.029
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25563-1
01:55:13.655 --> 01:55:16.149
element, I'll have to traverse
all of them and insert it here.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25570-0
01:55:16.279 --> 01:55:16.899
So it's big of.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25591-0
01:55:18.599 --> 01:55:20.359
Inserting his cumbersome right?
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25626-0
01:55:18.979 --> 01:55:22.219
Insertion is yeah, insertion is
cumbersome because every time

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25626-1
01:55:22.219 --> 01:55:25.563
you are doing a check and then
you know going left or right and

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25613-0
01:55:24.199 --> 01:55:24.359
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25626-2
01:55:25.563 --> 01:55:28.959
doing all that but with the hope
that search will be beneficial.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25667-0
01:55:29.449 --> 01:55:33.299
But in this case, because of
that skewed Ness search also did

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25667-1
01:55:33.299 --> 01:55:36.838
not become log N that is also N,
so insertion, deletion,

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25667-2
01:55:36.838 --> 01:55:40.439
searching all of them became big
of north, which is fine.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25671-0
01:55:39.919 --> 01:55:40.139
OK.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25680-0
01:55:40.669 --> 01:55:43.439
But using this concept we will
create something better later.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25691-0
01:55:43.829 --> 01:55:46.699
Yeah, using AVL trees he will
promise us better complexity.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25700-0
01:55:48.089 --> 01:55:49.549
So that's how evolution happens,
right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25724-0
01:55:49.559 --> 01:55:52.815
Initially we make mistakes, but
later if there is a better data

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25724-1
01:55:52.815 --> 01:55:55.359
structure on top of this, it
uses these concepts.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25738-0
01:55:55.969 --> 01:55:57.879
So there is 18, yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25764-0
01:55:57.519 --> 01:56:02.363
So, so didn't we St there won't
be ever such kind of scenario

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25764-1
01:56:02.363 --> 01:56:07.130
where we are getting any such
number which we have to insert

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25764-2
01:56:07.130 --> 01:56:07.989
in between.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25770-0
01:56:08.919 --> 01:56:09.549
Uh.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25778-0
01:56:09.069 --> 01:56:10.409
Yeah, there will never be a
case.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25786-0
01:56:09.559 --> 01:56:11.339
With with this person, yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25787-0
01:56:11.409 --> 01:56:12.779
Yeah, always.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25795-0
01:56:12.789 --> 01:56:14.619
It'll go get added in the leaf.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25798-0
01:56:14.889 --> 01:56:15.439
You're right.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25803-0
01:56:15.529 --> 01:56:16.349
Would observation.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25811-0
01:56:16.609 --> 01:56:18.269
You cannot just randomly insert
somewhere here.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25813-0
01:56:18.989 --> 01:56:19.519
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25845-0
01:56:19.589 --> 01:56:23.403
So what about 1818 is less than
20 go to the left, 18 is greater

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25845-1
01:56:23.403 --> 01:56:26.279
than 10, go to the right, 18 is
greater than 15.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25847-0
01:56:26.409 --> 01:56:27.369
So hide in there.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25853-0
01:56:30.079 --> 01:56:30.609
Insertion.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25866-0
01:56:30.619 --> 01:56:31.599
Is it clear for all of you?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25880-0
01:56:32.009 --> 01:56:38.299
So I guess internal, so we won't
be able to add that element.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25914-0
01:56:38.369 --> 01:56:41.894
So wherever it is incomplete,
that is only the place we can

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25901-0
01:56:41.319 --> 01:56:41.699
Correct.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25928-0
01:56:41.739 --> 01:56:44.988
So that position, just like your
heap, we can call it AZZZ is the

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25914-1
01:56:41.894 --> 01:56:42.599
never do it.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25928-1
01:56:44.988 --> 01:56:47.499
appropriate position where it
should get inserted.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25944-0
01:56:48.649 --> 01:56:50.939
Yeah, we should find that Z and
then put him there.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25951-0
01:56:51.629 --> 01:56:52.039
Thanks.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25956-0
01:56:52.729 --> 01:56:54.939
So what if six is present below
8?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25963-0
01:56:54.949 --> 01:56:56.089
Then where will the seven go?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25976-0
01:56:57.209 --> 01:57:01.419
Where so 6 cannot be below 8.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25978-0
01:56:58.549 --> 01:56:59.749
If the below 8.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25985-0
01:57:01.429 --> 01:57:02.269
How can that be?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25990-0
01:57:02.769 --> 01:57:03.739
Somewhere here you mean or?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/25992-0
01:57:03.279 --> 01:57:05.299
I'm ohh yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26012-0
01:57:05.349 --> 01:57:09.409
OK, it should be less than, so
we can't repeat the six, right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26023-0
01:57:09.739 --> 01:57:10.739
It can be duplicated.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26037-0
01:57:10.129 --> 01:57:14.039
Yeah, but, but as I told, that's
a very rare edge case only if

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26037-1
01:57:14.039 --> 01:57:15.839
you are deciding to allow it.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26055-0
01:57:16.189 --> 01:57:18.544
But in general, if people are
talking about BST, it means

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26055-1
01:57:18.544 --> 01:57:19.559
duplicates are not there.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26064-0
01:57:20.509 --> 01:57:20.769
OK.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26070-0
01:57:20.529 --> 01:57:23.159
Yeah, only when you allow that
case, this is valid.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26075-0
01:57:23.209 --> 01:57:24.489
Otherwise this is not valid.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26081-0
01:57:25.449 --> 01:57:25.969
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26126-0
01:57:25.799 --> 01:57:33.195
So, so six, so six kind six can
go in the left of seven and also

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26087-0
01:57:26.309 --> 01:57:27.219
Analysis.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26092-0
01:57:27.639 --> 01:57:28.139
Uh-huh.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26100-0
01:57:28.289 --> 01:57:28.739
Yeah, go ahead.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26126-1
01:57:33.195 --> 01:57:36.609
it can go in the right of two.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26124-0
01:57:37.259 --> 01:57:37.589
Correct.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26138-0
01:57:37.759 --> 01:57:41.609
That's right, but only in the
definition or question.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26148-0
01:57:41.619 --> 01:57:44.559
If it's told that you can allow
duplicate, yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26156-0
01:57:44.569 --> 01:57:46.389
If five is to be inserted, no
problem right?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26161-0
01:57:47.559 --> 01:57:48.409
I use smaller than.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26170-0
01:57:48.419 --> 01:57:49.229
Let's clear all this.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26174-0
01:57:50.939 --> 01:57:52.329
You have taken several examples.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26183-0
01:57:52.419 --> 01:57:54.209
Five is less than 20, so go
here.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26201-0
01:57:54.269 --> 01:57:56.849
Five is less than 10 go here, 5
is less than six.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26207-0
01:57:55.619 --> 01:57:57.289
8 right of two.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26204-0
01:57:56.859 --> 01:57:57.159
Go here.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26208-0
01:57:57.989 --> 01:57:58.799
Yeah, that's right.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26212-0
01:57:59.229 --> 01:57:59.759
Put it here.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26216-0
01:57:59.829 --> 01:58:00.189
You're done.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26223-0
01:58:01.569 --> 01:58:03.019
Complexity because of N.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26232-0
01:58:03.169 --> 01:58:04.959
Yeah, I'll not go through the
whole story.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26241-0
01:58:04.969 --> 01:58:06.119
But you know why it is yen?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26246-0
01:58:06.209 --> 01:58:07.979
Because of that skewed Ness?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26249-0
01:58:09.219 --> 01:58:11.299
Yeah, cool.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26261-0
01:58:11.309 --> 01:58:14.399
That being said, I'll just
complete this slide.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26275-0
01:58:14.449 --> 01:58:17.319
We'll take this forward in the
next class instead.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26277-0
01:58:17.729 --> 01:58:18.269
All of you clear.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26287-0
01:58:20.239 --> 01:58:21.389
You will compare, left, right.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26296-0
01:58:21.399 --> 01:58:23.409
You'll go to the right place,
you'll insert him there.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26300-0
01:58:23.879 --> 01:58:24.439
Simple stuff.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26306-0
01:58:24.449 --> 01:58:25.629
There's a lot more exercises.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26314-0
01:58:25.639 --> 01:58:27.229
Practice them, keep even more
clear.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26319-0
01:58:28.189 --> 01:58:28.619
Deletion.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26330-0
01:58:29.499 --> 01:58:32.709
First of all, you'll have to
search for that number.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26339-0
01:58:32.799 --> 01:58:35.229
Do you agree I have BST?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26392-0
01:58:35.279 --> 01:58:38.358
I randomly tell you go delete
those, but several thousand

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26392-1
01:58:38.358 --> 01:58:41.542
should be there so you will
perform a search if that number

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26392-2
01:58:41.542 --> 01:58:45.046
what I told to delete is present
then you will delete if K is not

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26392-3
01:58:45.046 --> 01:58:48.071
present return a message that
delete that element is not

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26392-4
01:58:48.071 --> 01:58:48.549
possible.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26405-0
01:58:49.219 --> 01:58:53.349
But if that number is present,
then deletion involves 3 cases.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26422-0
01:58:54.099 --> 01:58:58.519
What I want to delete is a leaf
node, meaning it has no child.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26451-0
01:58:58.529 --> 01:59:02.119
If it is a leaf that is 1 case,
that is case one, case 2

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26451-1
01:59:02.119 --> 01:59:05.961
whatever I want to delete has
one child that has exactly one

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26451-2
01:59:05.961 --> 01:59:06.339
child.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26457-0
01:59:06.589 --> 01:59:07.439
Then it is case two.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26472-0
01:59:07.889 --> 01:59:11.179
What I want to delete has both
the children left and right.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26493-0
01:59:11.369 --> 01:59:15.009
Then it is case 3 for each of
the case there is a different

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26493-1
01:59:15.009 --> 01:59:16.889
technique to delete them, yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26527-0
01:59:17.709 --> 01:59:20.152
So what we will learn about all
the three cases in the next

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26527-1
01:59:20.152 --> 01:59:22.759
class if it is case one, how do
you delete if it is case 2, how

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26527-2
01:59:22.759 --> 01:59:23.329
do you delete?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26535-0
01:59:23.449 --> 01:59:24.629
If it is case 3, how do you
delete?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26545-0
01:59:25.639 --> 01:59:28.909
Yeah, and that will complete our
concept of BST.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26549-0
01:59:31.129 --> 01:59:31.819
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26557-0
01:59:31.889 --> 01:59:32.869
Is it clear for all of you?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26572-0
01:59:36.379 --> 01:59:38.039
As usual, I'll upload the
slides.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26574-0
01:59:37.969 --> 01:59:38.459
Yes, Sir.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26597-0
01:59:38.049 --> 01:59:41.651
You can practice the problems
and we will take it forward from

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26580-0
01:59:38.549 --> 01:59:38.889
Thank you.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26597-1
01:59:41.651 --> 01:59:43.309
here in the next class, yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26628-0
01:59:43.729 --> 01:59:49.072
Or I have a question, do we have
a standard library for in Python

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26628-1
01:59:49.072 --> 01:59:51.339
for this tree or we need to?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26625-0
01:59:50.619 --> 01:59:52.199
Yes, yes, there are plenty of
them.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26650-0
01:59:52.249 --> 01:59:55.458
Yeah, there are libraries, but
you will implement it from

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26650-1
01:59:55.458 --> 01:59:58.059
scratch, if at all you have
assignment on BSD.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26672-0
01:59:58.869 --> 02:00:02.310
Uh, I would recommend not to use
those builtins and just using

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26672-1
02:00:02.310 --> 02:00:03.839
plain linked list and so on.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26682-0
02:00:03.849 --> 02:00:05.019
Try to create it on your own.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26696-0
02:00:05.719 --> 02:00:06.789
Yeah, try to write.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26716-0
02:00:05.809 --> 02:00:11.009
Not for the exam in uh for
implement for in.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26711-0
02:00:09.849 --> 02:00:11.219
Of course, yeah, you can use it.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26718-0
02:00:11.229 --> 02:00:12.669
Yeah. Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26729-0
02:00:12.629 --> 02:00:13.209
OK.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26739-0
02:00:12.679 --> 02:00:15.336
In your employment or in your
office, and all you can directly

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26739-1
02:00:15.336 --> 02:00:16.559
use those built-in libraries.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26752-0
02:00:17.699 --> 02:00:21.369
Yeah, they don't come by default
with Python.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26754-0
02:00:20.009 --> 02:00:20.309
OK.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26782-0
02:00:21.439 --> 02:00:25.443
As I told, there is a lot of
third party right just like

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26801-0
02:00:25.399 --> 02:00:29.473
Yeah, that is my concern is
because are they maintained or

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26782-1
02:00:25.443 --> 02:00:27.199
Numpy or pandas, correct?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26801-1
02:00:29.473 --> 02:00:33.409
not because I don't see any
standard library for praise.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26795-0
02:00:33.489 --> 02:00:33.939
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26819-0
02:00:33.999 --> 02:00:37.408
Yeah, they they will not be
maintained as good as Python

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26819-1
02:00:37.408 --> 02:00:40.279
because it's all created by
third party people.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26833-0
02:00:40.509 --> 02:00:42.908
But still there will be good
support because they're all open

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26833-1
02:00:42.908 --> 02:00:43.179
source.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26849-0
02:00:43.459 --> 02:00:46.595
You can always contribute if
there's a bug, you can report,

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26849-1
02:00:46.595 --> 02:00:48.059
it will be still maintained.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26853-0
02:00:50.259 --> 02:00:50.869
OK.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26868-0
02:00:50.919 --> 02:00:51.259
Thank you.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26863-0
02:00:51.089 --> 02:00:52.479
Yeah, notebook for BST.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26870-0
02:00:52.489 --> 02:00:53.659
Yes, we will upload that.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26888-0
02:00:53.709 --> 02:00:56.512
Yeah, but after completing after
completing all the concept,

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26888-1
02:00:56.512 --> 02:00:57.339
we'll upload that.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26907-0
02:00:58.029 --> 02:01:01.859
Can there be a case for where we
have a subtree associated with

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26907-1
02:01:01.859 --> 02:01:02.039
it?

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26920-0
02:01:02.049 --> 02:01:04.189
Yeah, in all the cases, subtree
is associated.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26937-0
02:01:05.279 --> 02:01:07.857
Yeah, that is what we're talking
in all the cases sub trees are

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26937-1
02:01:07.857 --> 02:01:08.099
there.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26954-0
02:01:10.739 --> 02:01:13.029
And then in the subtree you find
what you want to delete.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26968-0
02:01:13.459 --> 02:01:16.171
That is that case where you have
both children right, left and

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26968-1
02:01:16.171 --> 02:01:16.429
right.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26990-0
02:01:16.499 --> 02:01:19.416
It could be a subtree in
themselves, so all that can be

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/26990-1
02:01:19.416 --> 02:01:21.239
there, so let's take it from
here.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/27030-0
02:01:21.309 --> 02:01:24.925
We will complete the deletion
part alone and then we will go

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/27030-1
02:01:24.925 --> 02:01:28.244
to hashing and that will
complete your mid some potions

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/27030-2
02:01:28.244 --> 02:01:31.919
and the next class will be your
last class before your exams.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/27034-0
02:01:32.859 --> 02:01:32.999
Yeah.

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/27067-0
02:01:33.949 --> 02:01:37.940
And I also keep you posted, so
I'm traveling to one of the

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/27067-1
02:01:37.940 --> 02:01:41.728
campuses, so I might I'm
reaching on next Saturday, but

b3064098-7af9-4316-ab46-2adae8e6b689/27067-2
02:01:41.728 --> 02:01:44.299
let's see, maybe I will swap it
with.
