00:00:20.024 --> 00:00:24.014
I'm going to be the faculty for
introduction to data system.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/157-0
00:00:25.894 --> 00:00:26.214

And what we will do is let's get
started with the subject.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/241-0
00:00:47.974 --> 00:00:53.572

00:00:53.572 --> 00:00:55.564
doing it pretty soon.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/250-0
00:00:55.774 --> 00:00:58.244
Maybe in 10 minutes or so.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/268-0
00:00:59.334 --> 00:01:05.916
Uh, OK, I'm seeing two people,
Janakiraman and VIJAYALAKSHMI in

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/268-1
00:01:05.916 --> 00:01:06.944
the lobby.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/278-0
00:01:06.994 --> 00:01:08.874
I'm I'm not sure I should be.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/302-0
00:01:10.334 --> 00:01:15.108
Uh, what is the reason why they
had to come with some ID which

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/302-1
00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:16.244
is not bits ID?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/308-0
00:01:17.364 --> 00:01:18.774
Uh, So what?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/314-0
00:01:18.784 --> 00:01:19.864
I'm going to do is.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/328-0
00:01:23.704 --> 00:01:26.014
I'm I'm denying the entry for
the time being.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/359-0
00:01:26.024 --> 00:01:30.346
I I think I cannot because our
administration is very clear

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/359-1
00:01:30.346 --> 00:01:34.812
that everybody should log in
with the the Google ID that BITS

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/359-2
00:01:34.812 --> 00:01:35.964
provides to you.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/364-0
00:01:36.954 --> 00:01:38.534
OK, so let's get.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/402-0
00:01:41.614 --> 00:01:46.444
So today we will be really doing
an introduction to the course

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/402-1
00:01:46.444 --> 00:01:50.201
and in a way it's an
introduction to the program

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/402-2
00:01:50.201 --> 00:01:51.504
because you know.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/456-0
00:01:55.444 --> 00:01:59.671
I do you know the program is all
about data science, and in this

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/456-1
00:01:59.671 --> 00:02:03.767
semester, this course is going
to tell you about the basics of

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/456-2
00:02:03.767 --> 00:02:07.603
data science so that you are
ready to receive the advanced

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/456-3
00:02:07.603 --> 00:02:10.334
content with respect to the data
science.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/467-0
00:02:12.944 --> 00:02:16.474
OK, what is the I?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/492-0
00:02:16.524 --> 00:02:21.203
I'm not sure what is the concept
of system not working because it

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/492-1
00:02:21.203 --> 00:02:24.464
is a there are people with the
access issues.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/496-0
00:02:26.454 --> 00:02:26.974
OK.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/505-0
00:02:28.594 --> 00:02:30.684
Uh, just give me one minute.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/510-0
00:02:30.694 --> 00:02:31.584
Give me one minute.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/558-0
00:02:31.594 --> 00:02:35.923
Let me check with the
administration whether this is

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/558-1
00:02:35.923 --> 00:02:41.314
OK for me to allow for the first
session or because I do not want

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/558-2
00:02:41.314 --> 00:02:46.379
to do something which is which
is clearly denied or forbidden

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/558-3
00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.094
for the participants.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/576-0
00:03:06.694 --> 00:03:08.034
So I'm putting you people on me.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/616-0
00:04:17.774 --> 00:04:19.194
OK, OK.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/639-0
00:04:19.244 --> 00:04:24.116
I I'm not sure if the student
VIJAYALAKSHMI is available in

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/639-1
00:04:24.116 --> 00:04:26.714
conversation with anyone of you.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/671-0
00:04:26.794 --> 00:04:31.633
You can ask her or him to Join
Now because what administration

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/671-1
00:04:31.633 --> 00:04:36.626
is saying is that yes, there are
some people who are having some

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/671-2
00:04:36.626 --> 00:04:37.394
ID issues.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/707-0
00:04:37.404 --> 00:04:41.555
The in the sense that their
ideas have been set up very

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/707-1
00:04:41.555 --> 00:04:46.151
late, so it is possible that the
the MS Teams is denying them

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/707-2
00:04:46.151 --> 00:04:47.114
access using.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/717-0
00:04:47.264 --> 00:04:49.884
So I'm willing to allow that so.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/729-0
00:04:50.134 --> 00:04:54.474
So if there are some some of
your friends who want to join?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/734-0
00:04:55.484 --> 00:04:56.434
Uh only.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/748-0
00:04:56.484 --> 00:04:59.254
Only the people for whom the IDs
are not set up.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/753-0
00:04:59.624 --> 00:05:01.324
So you may inform them.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/778-0
00:05:06.654 --> 00:05:10.270
And this is this exception I'm
told is only for this session

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/778-1
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.174
because they are aware of the
technical matters.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/788-0
00:05:20.274 --> 00:05:22.394
OK, let's get started with the
subject.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/808-0
00:05:26.264 --> 00:05:31.299
So these are the course
objectives and the let me put it

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/808-1
00:05:31.299 --> 00:05:33.154
in presentation mode.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/822-0
00:05:38.064 --> 00:05:42.869
All right, help you understand
the role of data science, aren't

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/822-1
00:05:42.869 --> 00:05:43.094
it?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/868-0
00:05:43.224 --> 00:05:47.840
And help you understand the
stages in data science project

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/868-1
00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.534
and familiarize you with the
processes, tools, technologies

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/868-2
00:05:52.534 --> 00:05:56.758
and appreciate things like
several techniques such as

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/868-3
00:05:56.758 --> 00:06:01.374
visualization, storytelling and
understand the techniques.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/901-0
00:06:01.384 --> 00:06:07.242
In fact, we will spend half the
time studying the techniques for

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/901-1
00:06:07.242 --> 00:06:12.108
techniques for real world data
and data analytics and

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/901-2
00:06:12.108 --> 00:06:16.704
discovering the intelligent,
interesting patterns.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/911-0
00:06:16.954 --> 00:06:20.254
So this is where we will spend
most of time.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/924-0
00:06:26.174 --> 00:06:32.594
So our intent is that you learn
how to discover.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/928-0
00:06:39.164 --> 00:06:39.984
Interesting.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/932-0
00:06:42.824 --> 00:06:43.364
Patterns.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/945-0
00:06:46.094 --> 00:06:49.904
That are he then in the date.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/978-0
00:07:00.864 --> 00:07:09.067
And these are the textbooks and
the and I encourage you that you

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/978-1
00:07:09.067 --> 00:07:13.484
own at least T1 or T4 if
possible.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1005-0
00:07:13.964 --> 00:07:18.043
And if you are someone who is
deep in the subject, who is

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1005-1
00:07:18.043 --> 00:07:21.840
working on many of these
methods, all these books are

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1005-2
00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:22.754
good for you.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1007-0
00:07:23.044 --> 00:07:23.284
Alright.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1056-0
00:07:24.014 --> 00:07:30.733
And the structure of the course
is the Today we will be focusing

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1056-1
00:07:30.733 --> 00:07:37.348
on fundamentals and then we will
be spending about four or five

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1056-2
00:07:37.348 --> 00:07:43.964
sessions depending on the pace
at which we go in looking at the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1056-3
00:07:43.964 --> 00:07:45.824
data descriptions.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1060-0
00:07:50.644 --> 00:07:52.074
Data preprocessing.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1087-0
00:07:57.724 --> 00:08:03.994
And then we will be spending
significant amount of time that

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1087-1
00:08:03.994 --> 00:08:10.264
is about about 8 sessions is
planned, 8 sessions is planned.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1097-0
00:08:14.194 --> 00:08:17.574
On deep patterns.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1124-0
00:08:21.624 --> 00:08:26.194
And we will look briefly into
what is the meaning of a pattern

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1124-1
00:08:26.194 --> 00:08:29.894
called Classification
Association cluster anomaly.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1154-0
00:08:30.164 --> 00:08:35.245
So we will look at them in maybe
after half hour and we will

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1154-1
00:08:35.245 --> 00:08:40.575
spend some time that after you
discover the pattern, how do you

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1154-2
00:08:40.575 --> 00:08:41.824
tell the story?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1174-0
00:08:43.204 --> 00:08:48.619
And then towards the end, we
will look at what are the ethics

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1174-1
00:08:48.619 --> 00:08:50.104
for data science.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1223-0
00:08:55.814 --> 00:09:01.986
And the evaluation is in the
form of two quizzes with the 10%

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1223-1
00:09:01.986 --> 00:09:07.462
marks overall, then two
assignments with the 20% Marks

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1223-2
00:09:07.462 --> 00:09:13.236
and then mid semester and
comprehensive examinations with

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1223-3
00:09:13.236 --> 00:09:13.634
70%.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1240-0
00:09:17.154 --> 00:09:20.740
And the calendar and the
schedule will be announced the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1240-1
00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:21.124
dates.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1244-0
00:09:25.844 --> 00:09:27.214
Will be announced.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1251-0
00:09:30.714 --> 00:09:33.064
In the canvas.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1269-0
00:09:43.474 --> 00:09:50.674
OK, so I hope I hope we is so
far uneventful.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1272-0
00:09:50.684 --> 00:09:51.314
It is clear.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1279-0
00:09:51.464 --> 00:09:53.174
OK, someone has a question.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1290-0
00:09:53.184 --> 00:09:56.254
Is the mid semester closed book
and or openbook?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1307-0
00:09:56.324 --> 00:09:59.911
I believe mid semester meant to
be open closed book and end

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1307-1
00:09:59.911 --> 00:10:01.824
semester is for is an open book.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1336-0
00:10:14.434 --> 00:10:18.832
Uh, yes, Mr that mendra should
my you are allowed to carry the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1336-1
00:10:18.832 --> 00:10:21.904
lecture notes to the open book
examination.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1350-0
00:10:25.104 --> 00:10:27.554
Uh and assignment will be in
groups.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1370-0
00:10:27.804 --> 00:10:31.266
Mr Shamshad is asking assignment
will be in the groups and the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1370-1
00:10:31.266 --> 00:10:33.134
group formation we will
announce.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1377-0
00:10:33.404 --> 00:10:35.804
So so that you Please wait for
that.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1394-0
00:10:42.784 --> 00:10:49.334
So first we will go with the you
defining what is data science.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1448-0
00:10:51.884 --> 00:10:57.396
So we are taking the definition
from one of the reputed

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1448-1
00:10:57.396 --> 00:11:03.695
organization and in any case I
the the you know there are there

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1448-2
00:11:03.695 --> 00:11:08.617
are so many words in our
industry and there is no

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1448-3
00:11:08.617 --> 00:11:14.424
authority to define those words
or to interpret the words.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1475-0
00:11:14.574 --> 00:11:19.566
So in that sense, you need to
live with the little bit of

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1475-1
00:11:19.566 --> 00:11:24.987
interpretation element within
any of these definitions that we

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1475-2
00:11:24.987 --> 00:11:25.934
talk about.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1483-0
00:11:26.334 --> 00:11:28.814
So we have so.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1493-0
00:11:29.284 --> 00:11:32.854
So it makes sense that we take
it from a reputed vendor.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1496-0
00:11:38.174 --> 00:11:38.794
Alright.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1510-0
00:11:39.194 --> 00:11:45.277
And this is talking about
uncovering actionable insights

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1510-1
00:11:45.277 --> 00:11:47.304
hidden in the data.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1536-0
00:11:48.934 --> 00:11:53.792
And why do we want to discover
the actionable insights they

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1536-1
00:11:53.792 --> 00:11:57.354
help with the decision making
and planning?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1545-0
00:11:59.044 --> 00:12:01.834
And what is involved in data
science?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1582-0
00:12:02.424 --> 00:12:08.634
It will involve math and stats,
so programming and let me put it

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1582-1
00:12:08.634 --> 00:12:14.652
along with this though, though
the definition does not put it,

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1582-2
00:12:14.652 --> 00:12:18.664
so let me include algos or or
algorithms.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1599-0
00:12:23.264 --> 00:12:26.854
OK, so so along the programming.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1626-0
00:12:26.914 --> 00:12:31.825
The programming requires
algorithms, then understanding

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1626-1
00:12:31.825 --> 00:12:36.298
the analytics and then
artificial intelligence and

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1626-2
00:12:36.298 --> 00:12:41.034
machine learning along with
subject matter expertise.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1630-0
00:12:42.274 --> 00:12:42.514
Right.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1641-0
00:12:43.314 --> 00:12:46.464
And why is it that we need to
study data science?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1649-0
00:12:47.574 --> 00:12:49.624
I think we will.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1690-0
00:12:49.634 --> 00:12:54.483
We will be keeping on looking at
the reason why we should be

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1690-1
00:12:54.483 --> 00:12:58.935
doing it, but maybe we can take
a few minutes to have a

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1690-2
00:12:58.935 --> 00:13:03.705
conversation about why is it
that data science required, so

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1690-3
00:13:03.705 --> 00:13:05.454
maybe I'll start with.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1708-0
00:13:05.614 --> 00:13:09.807
Yeah, I'll I think it's an
opportune time for me to unmute

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1708-1
00:13:09.807 --> 00:13:11.584
you people for some time.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1718-0
00:13:11.874 --> 00:13:14.844
So I'm sorry, this is the.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1724-0
00:13:14.914 --> 00:13:16.964
This is the participants.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1762-0
00:13:17.034 --> 00:13:20.937
I'm allowing mic OK so so we
will spend few minutes

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1762-1
00:13:20.937 --> 00:13:25.065
understanding why is it that
data science required and

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1762-2
00:13:25.065 --> 00:13:29.868
possibly this will answer some
of the questions that we address

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1762-3
00:13:29.868 --> 00:13:30.994
as we go along.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1767-0
00:13:31.964 --> 00:13:32.814
OK.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1786-0
00:13:32.864 --> 00:13:37.014
Mr Suhail Ganesh is saying is
better decisions alright?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1789-0
00:13:37.184 --> 00:13:37.604
Alright.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1794-0
00:13:38.504 --> 00:13:41.154
But but how is the?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1799-0
00:13:41.224 --> 00:13:42.184
How is it helping?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1833-0
00:13:42.194 --> 00:13:49.193
I mean, is there something that
OK now let us let us go to some

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1833-1
00:13:49.193 --> 00:13:54.224
some small note that it's here,
this is 2008.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1853-0
00:13:55.144 --> 00:13:58.234
So before 2008, what people not
making decisions?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1845-0
00:13:57.274 --> 00:13:57.784
Hello.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1851-0
00:13:58.404 --> 00:13:58.654
Hello.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1871-0
00:13:58.664 --> 00:14:04.069
Or is it that that data
scientist designation is heard

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1862-0
00:13:58.884 --> 00:14:01.114
Ohh Sir, am I audible?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1871-1
00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:06.034
of only last decade?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1870-0
00:14:04.464 --> 00:14:04.684
And.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1883-0
00:14:06.144 --> 00:14:09.111
So does it mean that people were
not making decisions before

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1883-1
00:14:09.111 --> 00:14:09.354
that?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1895-0
00:14:10.914 --> 00:14:12.024
OK, there are.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1890-0
00:14:11.074 --> 00:14:11.484
Hello.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1901-0
00:14:11.494 --> 00:14:11.974
Am I audible?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1904-0
00:14:12.074 --> 00:14:13.854
There are few things that we
need.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1908-0
00:14:13.964 --> 00:14:15.274
OK, right.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1916-0
00:14:15.324 --> 00:14:17.264
You are right, it's a insights.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1920-0
00:14:17.314 --> 00:14:17.924
So.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1936-0
00:14:18.054 --> 00:14:21.394
So we will look at maybe an
example that helps you

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1936-1
00:14:21.394 --> 00:14:22.114
understand.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1972-0
00:14:23.894 --> 00:14:29.791
So so now now there is suppose
that suppose that there is a

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1972-1
00:14:29.791 --> 00:14:35.295
data which is organized in
relational database and then

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1972-2
00:14:35.295 --> 00:14:39.324
what do you what do you what can
you do?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1977-0
00:14:39.684 --> 00:14:41.454
You can write SQL queries right?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1983-0
00:14:43.764 --> 00:14:45.034
You can write SQL queries.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1989-0
00:14:48.104 --> 00:14:49.514
You can create aggregates.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/1996-0
00:14:53.534 --> 00:14:55.244
OK, so far so good.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2029-0
00:14:55.514 --> 00:15:03.219
So now let us say we are talking
about God, EE, Automobile

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2028-0
00:15:00.494 --> 00:15:03.354
Excuse me, Sir, but can you
listen to me?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2029-1
00:15:03.219 --> 00:15:04.264
company.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2088-0
00:15:04.774 --> 00:15:09.976
Alright, a automobile company
that is, that is trying to are

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2088-1
00:15:09.976 --> 00:15:15.178
trying to decide on in fact it
needs it needs a lot of these

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2088-2
00:15:15.178 --> 00:15:20.635
aggregates because the decision
maker wants to know what is the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2088-3
00:15:20.635 --> 00:15:25.666
volume of sale in the East June
and what is the percentage

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2088-4
00:15:25.666 --> 00:15:29.674
increase in this month compared
to last month.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2107-0
00:15:30.144 --> 00:15:33.667
What is the percentage change in
this month compared to the same

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2107-1
00:15:33.667 --> 00:15:34.534
month last year?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2126-0
00:15:35.064 --> 00:15:41.425
So they will be interested in
many, many aggregates which are

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2126-1
00:15:41.425 --> 00:15:43.784
referred as OEP online.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2135-0
00:15:45.334 --> 00:15:46.874
Analytical processes.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2147-0
00:15:48.174 --> 00:15:51.234
So once again, can you, uh, can
you listen to us?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2172-0
00:15:52.434 --> 00:15:57.655
OK, so so they are able to do
that and now they also they also

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2172-1
00:15:57.655 --> 00:16:00.804
possibly want to know certain
things.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2187-0
00:16:01.334 --> 00:16:05.279
For example, they may want to
know what is the likelihood of

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2187-1
00:16:05.279 --> 00:16:06.314
sales next year.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2196-0
00:16:07.054 --> 00:16:08.744
So now it is a.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2213-0
00:16:08.824 --> 00:16:13.630
We can always think in terms of
uh, think in terms of a very

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2213-1
00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:15.284
simple extrapolation.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2217-0
00:16:15.594 --> 00:16:16.514
So the sales.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2229-0
00:16:20.014 --> 00:16:23.204
Alright, sales and then here.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2264-0
00:16:24.714 --> 00:16:31.811
So what we know is that sales in
this year sales in this year and

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2247-0
00:16:29.954 --> 00:16:30.704
Hello, Rao Sir.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2266-0
00:16:30.714 --> 00:16:34.924
Are you are you able to hear us
browser? Hello.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2264-1
00:16:31.811 --> 00:16:33.854
sales in this year.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2269-0
00:16:35.474 --> 00:16:37.144
So we have certain points.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2270-0
00:16:37.534 --> 00:16:37.694
Hello.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2274-0
00:16:40.384 --> 00:16:40.574
Hello.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2294-0
00:16:42.004 --> 00:16:44.954
So we want to know what is the
sales for this year.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2302-0
00:16:44.504 --> 00:16:45.684
Am I audible to anyone?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2364-0
00:16:45.994 --> 00:16:50.498
So I think it is not very
difficult for them that use this

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2333-0
00:16:46.734 --> 00:16:49.074
You're audible, but I think,
Sir, can't hear you.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2326-0
00:16:47.224 --> 00:16:48.194
Yeah, yeah, invertible.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2337-0
00:16:50.134 --> 00:16:50.854
Ohh.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2364-1
00:16:50.498 --> 00:16:55.460
data and do an extrapolation and
say that we can possibly expect

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2351-0
00:16:54.324 --> 00:16:54.804
OK.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2364-2
00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:58.284
the sales to be in this year so
far.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2358-0
00:16:57.254 --> 00:16:57.804
Thank you.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2375-0
00:16:57.814 --> 00:16:58.894
Thank you for confirmation.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2384-0
00:16:58.434 --> 00:17:02.684
So now you can say that can we
do it with the aggregations and

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2384-1
00:17:02.684 --> 00:17:03.224
queries?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2415-0
00:17:03.634 --> 00:17:08.918
And but using some statistical
functions we should be able to

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2415-1
00:17:08.918 --> 00:17:13.435
do and to this extent simple
extrapolation or linear

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2415-2
00:17:13.435 --> 00:17:16.674
extrapolation and forecast is
not do.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2426-0
00:17:16.684 --> 00:17:19.554
It is also data scientists to do
that forecasting.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2454-0
00:17:19.564 --> 00:17:25.527
So we are not so much concerned
about uh, this this was this

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2454-1
00:17:25.527 --> 00:17:30.414
salt are possibly possibly it
was it can be done.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2463-0
00:17:30.904 --> 00:17:33.724
So now let us look at another
data.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2472-0
00:17:34.514 --> 00:17:40.304
So we have data saying that, uh,
the age.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2477-0
00:17:42.614 --> 00:17:43.474
Of buyer.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2483-0
00:17:46.744 --> 00:17:48.534
And then color of car.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2501-0
00:17:51.824 --> 00:17:55.863
So we have an interesting we
have a pattern, age of the buyer

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2501-1
00:17:55.863 --> 00:17:56.254
is 30.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2507-0
00:17:57.324 --> 00:17:59.104
So bought a red car.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2525-0
00:18:00.504 --> 00:18:06.304
And 35 blue card, let us say,
let us simplify the problem.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2539-0
00:18:06.314 --> 00:18:09.523
There are only two colors that
they sell, red color or blue

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2539-1
00:18:09.523 --> 00:18:09.844
color.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2558-0
00:18:41.674 --> 00:18:42.034
Ohk.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2562-0
00:18:42.044 --> 00:18:42.314
OK.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2564-0
00:18:42.324 --> 00:18:42.924
You lick me.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2567-0

Lick me.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2572-0
00:18:43.334 --> 00:18:44.474
Be little more careful.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2578-0
00:18:46.904 --> 00:18:49.174
Alright, OK so.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2585-0
00:19:00.704 --> 00:19:01.634
No, no.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2592-0
00:19:01.644 --> 00:19:02.834
Look at this data.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2603-0
00:19:02.904 --> 00:19:05.644
I have got the age of the buyer
and color of the car.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2624-0

Let me put it this way.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2868-0

00:20:46.256 --> 00:20:46.904
something.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2992-0
00:20:50.574 --> 00:20:51.614
Yes, you can speak.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/2999-0
00:20:50.744 --> 00:20:53.294
I I yeah, I mean the site.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3040-0
00:20:53.394 --> 00:20:58.338
So I just wanted to know like I
missed one thing when we were

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3018-0
00:20:53.954 --> 00:20:54.974
Yes, Mr Amit, go ahead.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3040-1
00:20:58.338 --> 00:21:03.281
describing like the you see EC2
and EC3 and the media and the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3040-2
00:21:03.281 --> 00:21:05.354
final semester final exam.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3050-0
00:21:05.364 --> 00:21:07.544
So will it be open book or close
book?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3057-0
00:21:08.294 --> 00:21:10.774
The final examination will be
open book.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3065-0
00:21:12.704 --> 00:21:13.724
And the meat one will be.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3070-0
00:21:14.634 --> 00:21:15.274
Closed book.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3072-0
00:21:16.654 --> 00:21:17.164
OK. Thanks.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3087-0
00:21:22.224 --> 00:21:24.304
OK, other people who have got
the questions.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3090-0
00:21:23.794 --> 00:21:26.114
Right, so Karthik here I'm.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3100-0
00:21:26.124 --> 00:21:28.034
I'm just repeating the same
question for books, right?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3111-0
00:21:28.044 --> 00:21:30.644
You recommended T1 and T4 right
to start with.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3122-0
00:21:30.874 --> 00:21:31.374
Is that right?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3187-0
00:21:31.754 --> 00:21:35.747
See, The thing is that the most
of the algorithms that we study

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3187-1
00:21:35.747 --> 00:21:39.802
will be from either T1 or T4, so
that is why I was trying to say

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3149-0
00:21:38.234 --> 00:21:38.494
OK.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3187-2
00:21:39.802 --> 00:21:43.794
that at least have one of that
book because you will be able to

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3187-3
00:21:43.794 --> 00:21:47.350
study the details of the
algorithm and maybe the authors

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3187-4
00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:50.594
explanation that may be better
than my explanation.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3204-0
00:21:50.964 --> 00:21:53.914
So that is that is the reason
why I was saying T1T4.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3199-0
00:21:51.384 --> 00:21:51.664
OK.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3222-0
00:21:53.924 --> 00:21:55.554
But there is no other reason
but.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3237-0
00:21:55.664 --> 00:21:58.804
But it's still, we had to go
with T2 and 3T3 as well, right?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3234-0
00:21:59.214 --> 00:21:59.584
No, no.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3246-0
00:21:59.594 --> 00:22:00.024
Yes, yes.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3248-0
00:21:59.634 --> 00:22:00.164
Was told.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3270-0
00:22:00.034 --> 00:22:04.059
T2T3T3 will be covered, but then
one is about about the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3270-1
00:22:04.059 --> 00:22:08.084
presentation and one is about
overview of data science.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3296-0
00:22:08.334 --> 00:22:12.041
So I welcome you to own those
books too, but the algorithms

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3291-0
00:22:11.434 --> 00:22:11.724
God.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3296-1
00:22:12.041 --> 00:22:13.895
will be covered from T1 and T.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3297-0
00:22:14.434 --> 00:22:14.854
Thank you.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3322-0
00:22:16.854 --> 00:22:19.924
So Sir, I open.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3306-0
00:22:17.234 --> 00:22:17.604
You want it?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3315-0
00:22:17.814 --> 00:22:19.684
I need to buy both.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3323-0
00:22:19.974 --> 00:22:20.864
Do you one and T4?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3329-0
00:22:23.114 --> 00:22:23.474
Mr.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3348-0
00:22:23.484 --> 00:22:25.294
Harrigal, can you repeat the
question?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3365-0
00:22:24.724 --> 00:22:28.924
Yeah, anyone is fine or we need
to buy both the T1 and T4.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3380-0
00:22:28.644 --> 00:22:34.091
Yes, actually both these authors
are competitive in the market in

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3380-1
00:22:34.091 --> 00:22:36.154
the sense that they they.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3419-0
00:22:36.284 --> 00:22:39.683
So either of them should be good
but but then if you are, if you

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3402-0
00:22:39.044 --> 00:22:39.694
OK. Thank.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3419-1
00:22:39.683 --> 00:22:43.030
are really deeply interested in,
maybe you can buy both because

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3419-2
00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:44.494
they're not expensive books.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3444-0
00:22:44.834 --> 00:22:49.046
So the books that we are
prescribing are all within

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3444-1
00:22:49.046 --> 00:22:51.394
within ₹1000 less than ₹1000.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3449-0
00:22:51.404 --> 00:22:53.364
So maybe 607 hundred kind of
things.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3452-0
00:22:55.504 --> 00:22:55.844
Thank you.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3465-0
00:22:59.104 --> 00:23:01.334
So umm, Sir I one question.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3506-0
00:23:01.564 --> 00:23:05.145
So in terms of in finding
insights and all business

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3506-1
00:23:05.145 --> 00:23:09.207
intelligence is always there and
quite sometimes there are

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3506-2
00:23:09.207 --> 00:23:13.682
multiple tools to go through the
data raw data and convert it in

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3506-3
00:23:13.682 --> 00:23:16.574
information and more useful
thing, right.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3530-0
00:23:16.584 --> 00:23:20.534
So even the data science you're
describing it, it also helps us

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3530-1
00:23:20.534 --> 00:23:23.064
to find the insights of the
data, right.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3568-0
00:23:23.074 --> 00:23:26.711
So are we talking about
predictive analytics, which is

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3535-0
00:23:23.724 --> 00:23:23.944
Right.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3568-1
00:23:26.711 --> 00:23:30.745
specific to data science or
finding insights is always there

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3568-2
00:23:30.745 --> 00:23:34.184
in the system without even
before the data science.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3687-0
00:23:34.334 --> 00:23:38.214
When AM alarm tonight using any
BI tools and all it's.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3582-0
00:23:37.234 --> 00:23:38.024
OK. Right.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3587-0
00:23:38.194 --> 00:23:38.884
Right, right.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3594-0
00:23:39.284 --> 00:23:41.604
So, so fine, Mr VENKATRAMAN.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3646-0
00:23:41.614 --> 00:23:45.214
I think the question will be I I
think you are knowledgeable

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3646-1
00:23:45.214 --> 00:23:48.931
enough that I I don't need to
give you answer because there is

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3646-2
00:23:48.931 --> 00:23:52.767
I do not have much better answer
but but then as we discussed so

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3646-3
00:23:52.767 --> 00:23:55.304
maybe at some other point we can
bring up.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3675-0
00:23:55.494 --> 00:23:59.870
So it's not really that the data
science term was introduced in

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3675-1
00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:04.315
10 years back or became popular,
but then some of the techniques

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3675-2
00:24:04.315 --> 00:24:06.024
existed even before that.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3680-0
00:24:06.034 --> 00:24:06.934
So I agree with that.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3701-0
00:24:09.204 --> 00:24:10.644
But anyway, if?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3693-0
00:24:09.524 --> 00:24:09.724
Umm.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3691-0
00:24:11.094 --> 00:24:11.454
Sure.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3705-0
00:24:11.464 --> 00:24:12.324
Thank you. Thanks.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3706-0
00:24:12.414 --> 00:24:13.624
Yeah alright any.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3718-0
00:24:13.204 --> 00:24:17.068
That this one last question
regarding the motor mode of the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3718-1
00:24:17.068 --> 00:24:17.454
exams.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3783-0
00:24:17.864 --> 00:24:21.179
When you say offline online and
you know the midterms and then

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3783-1
00:24:21.179 --> 00:24:24.652
teams, these are all we go to an
exam center and take or you will

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3783-2
00:24:24.652 --> 00:24:27.757
we can we have an online link
and if it is online look how

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3758-0
00:24:26.194 --> 00:24:26.544
Uh.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3771-0
00:24:26.554 --> 00:24:27.464
See, that is.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3774-0
00:24:27.554 --> 00:24:28.504
That is something.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3783-3
00:24:27.757 --> 00:24:28.914
will we enforce those.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3811-0
00:24:28.514 --> 00:24:31.358
Please, Please wait for the
announcement from the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3811-1
00:24:31.358 --> 00:24:34.941
administration because that will
not apply to only one subject

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3801-0
00:24:34.894 --> 00:24:35.204
OK.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3811-2
00:24:34.941 --> 00:24:38.695
because so see generally that is
something that is related to all

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3811-3
00:24:38.695 --> 00:24:39.434
the subjects.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3832-0
00:24:39.734 --> 00:24:44.259
So let us wait for this, because
I they they maybe see

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3820-0
00:24:40.244 --> 00:24:40.564
Alright.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3832-1
00:24:44.259 --> 00:24:45.164
previously.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3842-0
00:24:45.174 --> 00:24:46.684
I I can tell you only the
history.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3889-0
00:24:47.034 --> 00:24:51.739
So till 2019 we used to have all
these examinations in

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3889-1
00:24:51.739 --> 00:24:57.385
examination centers and 2020, we
started having once the epidemic

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3863-0
00:24:55.134 --> 00:24:55.434
OK.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3889-2
00:24:57.385 --> 00:25:02.603
started, all these examinations
became online and now now we

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3889-3
00:25:02.603 --> 00:25:06.624
have we have freedom to conduct
in either way.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3903-0
00:25:06.854 --> 00:25:08.854
So, but Please wait for the
announcement from the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3903-1
00:25:08.854 --> 00:25:09.454
administration.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3916-0
00:25:09.464 --> 00:25:11.734
This is decided by the
administration.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3911-0
00:25:10.434 --> 00:25:10.614
Thank.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3926-0
00:25:13.114 --> 00:25:13.844
Thank you for that. Yeah.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3958-0
00:25:14.004 --> 00:25:18.351
OK, Mr Harikrishnan is saying,
what is the meaning of open book

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3958-1
00:25:18.351 --> 00:25:22.563
open book means that you can
have the textbook and print outs

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3958-2
00:25:22.563 --> 00:25:26.434
of the slides and print and the
notes etcetera with you.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3962-0
00:25:26.984 --> 00:25:27.864
Is that good enough?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3966-0
00:25:30.814 --> 00:25:31.304
Yes, Sir.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3985-0
00:25:31.314 --> 00:25:35.084
And one more question is the
Exama pen and paper or an

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3985-1
00:25:35.084 --> 00:25:35.564
online?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/3993-0
00:25:35.814 --> 00:25:37.074
I mean in the center.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4019-0
00:25:37.624 --> 00:25:41.094
Ohh that we will announce
because there is some discussion

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4019-1
00:25:41.094 --> 00:25:44.094
going on but till now it is
largely pen and paper.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4036-0
00:25:44.504 --> 00:25:48.730
After you write it on pen, you
actually you send the picture to

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4025-0
00:25:44.714 --> 00:25:44.854
So.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4036-1
00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:48.994
the.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4039-0
00:25:49.004 --> 00:25:49.804
You upload the picture.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4041-0
00:25:51.164 --> 00:25:51.594
OK.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4048-0
00:25:51.744 --> 00:25:52.174
Thank you, Sir.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4071-0
00:25:53.014 --> 00:25:56.153
So one more question, so mute
will you solve any use case like

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4071-1
00:25:56.153 --> 00:25:58.794
class screen regression using
Python in this course?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4126-0
00:26:00.164 --> 00:26:05.103
Uh, as we go along short, we
will have some sessions or some

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4126-1
00:26:05.103 --> 00:26:10.284
interaction and some guidelines
or some support with respect to

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4126-2
00:26:10.284 --> 00:26:14.979
Python, but then Python itself
will not be the main topic

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4126-3
00:26:14.979 --> 00:26:19.999
because we the the subject is
not necessarily only for Python

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4126-4
00:26:19.999 --> 00:26:21.294
programs though.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4157-0
00:26:21.344 --> 00:26:24.560
Though let me clarify that the M
tech data science students need

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4157-1
00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:27.727
to know Python because all the
assignments in all these objects

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4157-2
00:26:27.727 --> 00:26:28.914
will be based on Python.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4179-0
00:26:30.074 --> 00:26:33.738
But so in that sense, you need
to know the Python, but then

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4179-1
00:26:33.738 --> 00:26:35.204
these the course itself.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4213-0
00:26:35.214 --> 00:26:38.785
The LECTURES itself will have
nothing to do with Python And

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4213-1
00:26:38.785 --> 00:26:42.297
and we will give you possibly
some hints or some help with

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4213-2
00:26:42.297 --> 00:26:45.154
respect to demonstrating
something's in Python.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4228-0
00:26:46.644 --> 00:26:49.500
And then specific so would we
have any lab in this course as

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4228-1
00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:49.734
well?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4231-0
00:26:51.154 --> 00:26:51.684
It's not.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4266-0
00:26:51.834 --> 00:26:55.451
See, The thing is there will be
some tutorials with some more

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4266-1
00:26:55.451 --> 00:26:58.892
help in regarding Python will be
given and for the sake of

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4266-2
00:26:58.892 --> 00:27:01.634
assignments you may have to
write Python code.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4270-0
00:27:03.284 --> 00:27:03.774
Sure. Thanks.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4276-0
00:27:08.584 --> 00:27:09.994
Yes, OK.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4279-0
00:27:10.084 --> 00:27:11.054
There are no questions.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4306-0
00:27:11.064 --> 00:27:15.450
So now I want you to speak, but
speak on what you are seeing on

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4300-0
00:27:14.004 --> 00:27:14.844
Yeah, more.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4306-1
00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:16.204
this slide.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4309-0
00:27:17.074 --> 00:27:18.824
More car cars are sealed.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4325-0
00:27:18.834 --> 00:27:24.328
Sold are blue and younger people
are preferring red color than

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4318-0
00:27:21.354 --> 00:27:21.754
OK.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4325-1
00:27:24.328 --> 00:27:24.764
blue.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4326-0
00:27:26.214 --> 00:27:26.674
OK.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4340-0
00:27:26.684 --> 00:27:28.964
OK, Mr Reviendra Kumar Singh,
that is good.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4349-0
00:27:29.064 --> 00:27:32.804
Younger people are preferring
red color over blue color.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4353-0
00:27:32.844 --> 00:27:33.214
OK.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4358-0
00:27:33.264 --> 00:27:34.634
So that is that is good.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4368-0
00:27:34.964 --> 00:27:37.514
So now, now let us let us go
back.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4385-0
00:27:37.524 --> 00:27:40.944
Let us go back to let us go back
to what is here.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4445-0
00:27:41.384 --> 00:27:47.295
So if a CEO of the automobile
company wants to know how many

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4445-1
00:27:47.295 --> 00:27:53.302
cars were sold in the Western
region in the second quarter of

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4445-2
00:27:53.302 --> 00:27:58.922
202324, so be information
systems or who you've ever have

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4445-3
00:27:58.922 --> 00:28:04.348
to promptly give the CEO
accurate data that data has to

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4445-4
00:28:04.348 --> 00:28:05.704
be definitive.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4476-0
00:28:06.064 --> 00:28:11.604
So they have to say that model
M1V sold 10,434 cars and how

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4476-1
00:28:11.604 --> 00:28:15.204
much profit did we make on those
cars?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4497-0
00:28:15.334 --> 00:28:18.685
We have made 25 crores, 50,000
something something some number

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4497-1
00:28:18.685 --> 00:28:20.334
exact number they have to give.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4532-0
00:28:20.734 --> 00:28:26.199
So there aren't definitive
answers that are expected from

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4532-1
00:28:26.199 --> 00:28:32.229
some part of the data, but then
there is a lot of data in which

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4532-2
00:28:32.229 --> 00:28:35.904
we are not getting definitive
answers.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4554-0
00:28:36.294 --> 00:28:40.228
But then we are seeing some
patterns and then what is the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4554-1
00:28:40.228 --> 00:28:41.924
nature of these patterns?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4559-0
00:28:42.414 --> 00:28:44.964
These patterns have an
interesting property.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4563-0
00:28:44.974 --> 00:28:47.274
These are key.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4568-0
00:28:49.284 --> 00:28:51.764
These are approximate.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4578-0
00:28:57.314 --> 00:29:00.564
And these are probabilistic.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4631-0
00:29:05.154 --> 00:29:10.052
So based on this, uh, it's one
of you have correctly said that

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4631-1
00:29:10.052 --> 00:29:14.873
younger people seem to have a
tendency to buy red cars, while

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4631-2
00:29:14.873 --> 00:29:19.383
the people with the higher age
have seemed to be having a

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4631-3
00:29:19.383 --> 00:29:21.404
tendency to buy blue cars.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4643-0
00:29:22.204 --> 00:29:25.114
But then that data is not
definitive.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4663-0
00:29:25.544 --> 00:29:31.014
So there is a person with the
age of 35 is buying red car.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4683-0
00:29:31.164 --> 00:29:35.722
The person with the ease of 36
by sorry, age of 35 is buying

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4683-1
00:29:35.722 --> 00:29:36.394
blue car.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4715-0
00:29:36.444 --> 00:29:41.128
The person with the age of 36 is
buying a red car, but then that

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4715-1
00:29:41.128 --> 00:29:45.812
does not mean that that does not
mean that the pattern itself is

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4715-2
00:29:45.812 --> 00:29:46.244
wrong.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4747-0
00:29:46.714 --> 00:29:50.505
The pattern is anyway
approximate and many times we

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4747-1
00:29:50.505 --> 00:29:54.805
discover the pattern with a
level of accuracy that is less

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4747-2
00:29:54.805 --> 00:29:55.534
than 100%.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4764-0
00:29:55.664 --> 00:29:59.722
Sometimes we are happy to find
70% accurate pattern and now how

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4764-1
00:29:59.722 --> 00:30:01.244
to measure the accuracy?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4771-0
00:30:01.494 --> 00:30:02.964
Let's not jump that far.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4816-0
00:30:02.974 --> 00:30:06.150
So we will, we will for each
pattern we are going to see what

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4816-1
00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:09.378
is the level of quality of the
pattern and then how to compare

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4816-2
00:30:09.378 --> 00:30:12.657
the quality of multiple patterns
so that we are going to see as

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4816-3
00:30:12.657 --> 00:30:12.964
we go.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4830-0
00:30:13.644 --> 00:30:17.134
So now is this is this answer
definitive?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4839-0
00:30:17.144 --> 00:30:21.244
Somebody is walking in with the
age of 37.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4849-0
00:30:22.094 --> 00:30:24.614
What color of the car will the
person buy?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4854-0
00:30:29.884 --> 00:30:31.064
Probably blue.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4857-0
00:30:33.094 --> 00:30:33.464
No.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4866-0
00:30:33.474 --> 00:30:35.604
Yeah, possibly blue, possibly
blue.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4890-0
00:30:35.714 --> 00:30:39.604
So that is a that is just a
possible that it is likelihood.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4902-0
00:30:39.854 --> 00:30:42.843
But if that person asks for red
car, we are going to give the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4902-1
00:30:42.843 --> 00:30:43.904
person red car, right?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4909-0
00:30:44.634 --> 00:30:46.984
So so there is, yeah.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4911-0
00:30:44.984 --> 00:30:45.664
Of course, yes.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4974-0
00:30:47.034 --> 00:30:50.401
So the point is that so anytime
somebody may walk in with the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4974-1
00:30:50.401 --> 00:30:53.823
age of 21 and ask for blue car
and buy it, and the person with

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4974-2
00:30:53.823 --> 00:30:57.136
65 may come in and say that by
red card for whatever reasons

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4974-3
00:30:57.136 --> 00:31:00.286
they we don't need to find the
reasons that person may be

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4974-4
00:31:00.286 --> 00:31:02.404
buying for granddaughter, that's
fine.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4989-0
00:31:02.874 --> 00:31:06.104
But the person walks in for at
65 and buys erect card.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/4998-0
00:31:06.114 --> 00:31:06.864
We are going to give.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5011-0
00:31:07.154 --> 00:31:09.984
So now the point is that this is
not a definitive answer.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5022-0
00:31:09.994 --> 00:31:13.104
So will the person buy red car
or green card blue card?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5028-0
00:31:13.314 --> 00:31:15.174
But then it helps.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5045-0
00:31:15.184 --> 00:31:19.015
Suppose that suppose that the
manufacturer wants to know how

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5045-1
00:31:19.015 --> 00:31:20.774
should I maintain inventory.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5081-0
00:31:32.234 --> 00:31:36.678
So in that case it is possible
that one of our algorithm is

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5081-1
00:31:36.678 --> 00:31:41.121
possibly going to help that
person saying what is the, what

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5081-2
00:31:41.121 --> 00:31:42.454
is the indicative?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5085-0
00:31:42.694 --> 00:31:43.274
Uh.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5111-0
00:31:43.644 --> 00:31:48.341
A shade of for based on the heat
and what is the indicative

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5111-1
00:31:48.341 --> 00:31:52.959
preferences for based on the
ease or based on income based

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5111-2
00:31:52.959 --> 00:31:53.194
on.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5131-0
00:31:53.284 --> 00:31:57.825
In fact, we have taken a very,
very simple one dimensional data

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5131-1
00:31:57.825 --> 00:32:00.734
and one dimensional 1
dimensional glass.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5147-0
00:32:00.784 --> 00:32:03.778
We can call that as a class, so
that is because this is an

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5147-1
00:32:03.778 --> 00:32:04.894
interesting attribute.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5159-0
00:32:05.044 --> 00:32:07.744
This is going to determine
something for our decision

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5159-1
00:32:07.744 --> 00:32:08.094
making.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5163-0
00:32:08.404 --> 00:32:09.114
So.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5173-0
00:32:09.274 --> 00:32:12.254
So the point is that it is going
to help us.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5190-0
00:32:12.524 --> 00:32:18.470
So now, now what we are saying
is that the BI mostly focused on

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5190-1
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:18.934
this.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5212-0
00:32:21.764 --> 00:32:25.494
But I'm not seeing that BI only
focused on this BI, possibly

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5212-1
00:32:25.494 --> 00:32:27.634
also focused on something
related.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5222-0
00:32:27.704 --> 00:32:28.814
What is on the right side?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5265-0
00:32:29.504 --> 00:32:34.925
But it is the data science which
started more incorporating lot

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5265-1
00:32:34.925 --> 00:32:39.753
of probability and lot of
complex algorithms in order to

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5265-2
00:32:39.753 --> 00:32:45.258
draw back and so for example for
example we have elections going

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5265-3
00:32:45.258 --> 00:32:47.714
for several states right now.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5285-0
00:32:48.714 --> 00:32:52.676
So for elections, obviously
there are, there are everybody

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5285-1
00:32:52.676 --> 00:32:55.764
who is interested in the results
of election.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5293-0
00:32:56.434 --> 00:32:58.444
Of course, even before the
results come.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5315-0
00:32:58.514 --> 00:33:01.777
That is why that is what our in
curiosity is a lot more before

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5315-1
00:33:01.777 --> 00:33:02.864
the elections happen.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5331-0
00:33:03.134 --> 00:33:05.674
Then, after the elections are
over anyway, we'll get to know

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5331-1
00:33:05.674 --> 00:33:06.174
the results.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5348-0
00:33:06.574 --> 00:33:09.590
So our curiosity is a lot more
about who is going to win the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5348-1
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:10.084
elections.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5373-0
00:33:10.434 --> 00:33:13.636
So now how can we learn the
election results or how can we

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5373-1
00:33:13.636 --> 00:33:16.784
predict the election results
without before the elections

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5373-2
00:33:16.784 --> 00:33:17.164
happen?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5393-0
00:33:17.754 --> 00:33:21.299
Maybe somebody wants to tell so
that is all data science and

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5393-1
00:33:21.299 --> 00:33:23.274
then there are many data
science.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5408-0
00:33:23.284 --> 00:33:26.125
Who are presently working or
helping each political party

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5408-1
00:33:26.125 --> 00:33:27.154
with respect to that.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5418-0
00:33:27.624 --> 00:33:29.954
So that somebody wants to say
anything about it.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5438-0
00:33:32.024 --> 00:33:32.954
How are they going to do that?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5445-0
00:33:32.304 --> 00:33:35.464
Sentiment of sentiment can be
starting point.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5436-0
00:33:32.514 --> 00:33:32.874
I want the.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5452-0
00:33:37.074 --> 00:33:38.374
Uh yes, Mr Aditya Singh.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5462-0
00:33:38.634 --> 00:33:39.704
Can you repeat that?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5508-0
00:33:40.074 --> 00:33:44.514
That K sentiment of the crowd we
got regarding the parties

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5506-0
00:33:40.654 --> 00:33:43.552
That sentiment of the crowd we
got regarding all the parties

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5488-0
00:33:43.114 --> 00:33:43.704
Same to me.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5506-1
00:33:43.552 --> 00:33:44.264
can just start.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5497-0
00:33:43.754 --> 00:33:44.624
OK, same timing.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5508-1
00:33:44.514 --> 00:33:46.094
sentiment about that.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5517-0
00:33:44.634 --> 00:33:46.674
Same comment about that, yes,
yes, yes.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5510-0
00:33:46.104 --> 00:33:46.334
Yeah.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5548-0
00:33:46.384 --> 00:33:50.358
Ohh there is something already
called approval rate which we

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5527-0
00:33:49.904 --> 00:33:50.664
Yes, OK.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5548-1
00:33:50.358 --> 00:33:53.484
always get before the elections
and everything.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5532-0
00:33:50.724 --> 00:33:52.164
Yes, OK.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5577-0
00:33:52.174 --> 00:33:55.836
OK, so now maybe maybe is that
all approval ratings sentiment,

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5577-1
00:33:55.836 --> 00:33:59.439
do they do you think that those
people do it in such a simple

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5577-2
00:33:59.439 --> 00:34:01.124
way in one dimensional plane?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5582-0
00:34:01.454 --> 00:34:03.274
They will most probably look at
the dimension.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5590-0
00:34:04.524 --> 00:34:05.354
No, no, no, no.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5600-0
00:34:05.364 --> 00:34:08.274
Just maybe, maybe let me also
give you some hints.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5610-0
00:34:10.254 --> 00:34:13.614
In each area has the uh crowd.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5660-0
00:34:13.624 --> 00:34:18.105
Uh crowds a set of attributes
regarding the crowd and the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5660-1
00:34:18.105 --> 00:34:22.895
whatever the party is projecting
itself in that area based on

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5660-2
00:34:22.895 --> 00:34:27.608
that data which they collect
from that area, they'll present

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5660-3
00:34:27.608 --> 00:34:30.544
themselves accordingly to the
public.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5675-0
00:34:31.394 --> 00:34:33.264
So data personalization on the.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5673-0
00:34:31.754 --> 00:34:33.524
You're right, right that is
correct.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5681-0
00:34:33.994 --> 00:34:34.884
That is correct.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5688-0
00:34:35.094 --> 00:34:37.784
Yes, Mr Vertica, I fully agree
with you.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5696-0
00:34:37.894 --> 00:34:40.004
So they consider many
attributes.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5745-0
00:34:40.274 --> 00:34:43.930
For example, it is possible that
some political parties are

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5745-1
00:34:43.930 --> 00:34:47.463
favorite of factory workers and
some political party is a

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5745-2
00:34:47.463 --> 00:34:50.875
favorite of agriculture or
laborers, and some political

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5745-3
00:34:50.875 --> 00:34:54.835
party may be a favorite of rich
farmers and some political party

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5745-4
00:34:54.835 --> 00:34:56.724
is a favorite of professionals.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5766-0
00:34:56.914 --> 00:35:00.797
So it is the, it is the job of
those analysts who are working

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5766-1
00:35:00.797 --> 00:35:02.174
for political parties.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5817-0
00:35:02.844 --> 00:35:06.864
In order to analyze constituency
by constituency, some political

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5817-1
00:35:06.864 --> 00:35:10.513
parties may be preferred by
gender, so it is possible that

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5817-2
00:35:10.513 --> 00:35:14.100
the for some reason some people
of some gender may prefer

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5817-3
00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:17.625
females, may prefer certain
political party and so it is

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5817-4
00:35:17.625 --> 00:35:18.614
always possible.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5829-0
00:35:18.844 --> 00:35:22.323
And similarly, senior citizens
may prefer some political party

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5829-1
00:35:22.323 --> 00:35:23.814
because of various regions.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5861-0
00:35:24.144 --> 00:35:28.845
So now the point is that you
need to consider many attributes

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5861-1
00:35:28.845 --> 00:35:33.773
before and then you also need to
do a division of the population

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5861-2
00:35:33.773 --> 00:35:34.304
as per.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5899-0
00:35:34.714 --> 00:35:38.666
Ohh the this is referred as
demographic analysis and then

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5899-1
00:35:38.666 --> 00:35:42.618
based on that and then further
you need to see how is the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5899-2
00:35:42.618 --> 00:35:46.775
preference among the various
categories based on demographic

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5899-3
00:35:46.775 --> 00:35:47.524
parameters.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5907-0
00:35:47.974 --> 00:35:51.034
The preferences among the people
and so on.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5941-0
00:35:51.074 --> 00:35:54.107
So there can be more than that,
but then fine, we will leave it

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5941-1
00:35:54.107 --> 00:35:56.997
because, for example, you may
talk about ideology, but we'll

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5941-2
00:35:56.997 --> 00:35:58.134
let's not get into that.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5945-0
00:35:58.974 --> 00:35:59.524
So.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5960-0
00:35:59.534 --> 00:36:05.126
So the point is that so now here
we are talking about purely data

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5960-1
00:36:05.126 --> 00:36:05.804
science.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5988-0
00:36:05.814 --> 00:36:09.282
There is really nothing like
business intelligence, which is

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5988-1
00:36:09.282 --> 00:36:12.124
very often definitive, and
sometimes the business

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/5988-2
00:36:12.124 --> 00:36:15.194
intelligence also have
extrapolating content in that.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6031-0
00:36:15.704 --> 00:36:20.351
But the data science is mostly
about creating models whereby

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6031-1
00:36:20.351 --> 00:36:24.312
you can get probably
approximately correct answers,

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6031-2
00:36:24.312 --> 00:36:29.112
which is, you know pretty well
that when the elections happen,

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6031-3
00:36:29.112 --> 00:36:31.854
there will be at least 20
agencies.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6045-0
00:36:32.044 --> 00:36:34.634
All of them have a lot of data
scientists and they have.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6091-0
00:36:34.644 --> 00:36:38.866
They spent crores of rupees in
analyzing the voter preferences

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6091-1
00:36:38.866 --> 00:36:42.485
and immediately after the
elections are over, they're

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6091-2
00:36:42.485 --> 00:36:46.640
going to publish the no data
they they don't know, they don't

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6091-3
00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:50.594
know findings based on various
studies that they had done.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6105-0
00:36:51.104 --> 00:36:54.295
And you know that some of them
go wrong and some of them go

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6105-1
00:36:54.295 --> 00:36:54.614
right.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6122-0
00:36:55.404 --> 00:37:00.471
So this is because what they are
doing is probably approximately

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6122-1
00:37:00.471 --> 00:37:01.094
correct.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6143-0
00:37:01.424 --> 00:37:05.113
It is not a definitive answer
because they do not have the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6143-1
00:37:05.113 --> 00:37:07.114
reach to reach 150 crore people.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6188-0
00:37:07.444 --> 00:37:11.581
So all they can do is that they
will reach out to million people

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6188-1
00:37:11.581 --> 00:37:15.399
or at most million people, or
maybe 100,000 people, and the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6188-2
00:37:15.399 --> 00:37:19.218
quality of the analysis depends
on the attributes that they

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6188-3
00:37:19.218 --> 00:37:20.554
considered and so on.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6194-0
00:37:22.044 --> 00:37:23.474
So now does the.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6207-0
00:37:23.524 --> 00:37:29.094
Does it help you understand the
Mr VENKATRAMAN army In Sync?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6219-0
00:37:29.104 --> 00:37:33.334
That data science has some
attributes that did.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6225-0
00:37:32.434 --> 00:37:32.934
Something.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6221-0
00:37:33.744 --> 00:37:34.134
Yeah.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6261-0
00:37:34.144 --> 00:37:37.772
So which makes it different from
so the business intelligence

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6261-1
00:37:37.772 --> 00:37:41.106
though the business intelligence
also there is really no

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6261-2
00:37:41.106 --> 00:37:44.909
definition saying that business
intelligence should stop here or

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6261-3
00:37:44.909 --> 00:37:47.074
data science should start from
here.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6288-0
00:37:47.464 --> 00:37:50.969
But then what we know is that it
is largely associated with

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6288-1
00:37:50.969 --> 00:37:54.825
probabilistic, so statistics are
strongly associated with the our

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6288-2
00:37:54.825 --> 00:37:55.584
data science.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6300-0
00:37:55.814 --> 00:37:58.064
That is because our answers are
very often.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6302-0
00:37:58.134 --> 00:37:59.224
Consider the probabilities.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6309-0
00:38:00.394 --> 00:38:03.014
OK so so I will proceed little
further.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6318-0
00:38:08.134 --> 00:38:10.654
And and let me lick me.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6322-0
00:38:10.664 --> 00:38:11.224
Proceed.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6338-0
00:38:11.264 --> 00:38:17.199
I think I have been at the
beginning so so this diagram is

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6338-1
00:38:17.199 --> 00:38:19.814
possibly self explanatory.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6348-0
00:38:19.824 --> 00:38:24.114
Anyway, it is proposed by in
website.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6376-0
00:38:24.964 --> 00:38:33.270
So this is uh, and then you can
see that from this diagram there

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6376-1
00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:41.064
is a significant overlap between
the areas of DS, ML and EI.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6397-0
00:38:44.384 --> 00:38:48.505
So when we talk about data
science, we are talking about

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6397-1
00:38:48.505 --> 00:38:52.699
these are representing these are
representing the various

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6397-2
00:38:52.699 --> 00:38:53.494
algorithms.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6437-0
00:38:57.614 --> 00:39:00.670
And machine learning is a
mechanism whereby we try to

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6437-1
00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:04.066
solve many of the problems in
data science, not necessarily

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6437-2
00:39:04.066 --> 00:39:07.235
that every problem has 200% and
needs to have a machine

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6437-3
00:39:07.235 --> 00:39:07.744
learning.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6455-0
00:39:08.514 --> 00:39:13.149
So we can possibly do many of
the data preparation tasks and

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6455-1
00:39:13.149 --> 00:39:14.364
many statistics.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6495-0
00:39:14.634 --> 00:39:18.319
You may say that statistics is
not really machine learning,

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6495-1
00:39:18.319 --> 00:39:21.880
though it may look somewhat
similar in the sense that may

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6495-2
00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:25.197
give some results with some
accuracy or some level of

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6495-3
00:39:25.197 --> 00:39:28.574
confidence and and then
visualization experimentation.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6504-0
00:39:28.584 --> 00:39:31.124
These are all parts of data
science.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6537-0
00:39:31.174 --> 00:39:35.576
Not, but then they do not
involve really machine learning

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6537-1
00:39:35.576 --> 00:39:40.433
and machine learning is is going
to help us in creating many of

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6537-2
00:39:40.433 --> 00:39:43.924
the algorithms are based on
machine learning.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6563-0
00:39:43.934 --> 00:39:47.626
So those algorithms help the
machine understand the data and

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6563-1
00:39:47.626 --> 00:39:51.137
support us, and then when we are
talking about artificial

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6563-2
00:39:51.137 --> 00:39:51.924
intelligence.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6584-0
00:39:52.094 --> 00:39:55.463
So artificial intelligence also
has a strong element, which is,

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6584-1
00:39:55.463 --> 00:39:58.464
which is also, which also
incorporates machine learning.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6586-0
00:39:58.474 --> 00:39:58.914
Significantly.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6590-0
00:39:59.854 --> 00:40:01.044
Uh and uh.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6622-0
00:40:01.054 --> 00:40:06.334
Data science is if we look at if
you look at, uh, the machine

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6622-1
00:40:06.334 --> 00:40:11.017
learning, OK, maybe maybe we'll
let me put often it is

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6622-2
00:40:11.017 --> 00:40:11.954
supervised.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6625-0
00:40:15.604 --> 00:40:16.584
And unsupervised.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6628-0
00:40:16.644 --> 00:40:16.954
Waste.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6674-0
00:40:19.044 --> 00:40:23.510
These are the types of machine
learning which we deal with very

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6674-1
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:27.835
often, and maybe it can also be
a semi supervised and machine

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6674-2
00:40:27.835 --> 00:40:31.882
learning can also have and it
seldom we deal with what is

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6674-3
00:40:31.882 --> 00:40:34.324
known as a reinforcement
learning.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6690-0
00:40:39.394 --> 00:40:42.900
It's not so much valuable in
trying to understand the data of

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6690-1
00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:43.804
an organization.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6707-0
00:40:45.774 --> 00:40:48.680
But then, reinforcement learning
can be very valuable if you want

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6707-1
00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:49.384
to build a game.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6740-0
00:40:49.814 --> 00:40:53.949
Suppose that you want to build a
a game where where it is going

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6740-1
00:40:53.949 --> 00:40:57.696
to it can play with another
machine or it can play with a

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6740-2
00:40:57.696 --> 00:40:58.084
human.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6762-0
00:40:58.434 --> 00:41:02.690
Or if you want to teach it to
some robotics, for example, how

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6762-1
00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:05.024
to work through a hazardous
area.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6787-0
00:41:05.254 --> 00:41:08.069
So in such cases we want to work
with a form of a machine

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6787-1
00:41:08.069 --> 00:41:10.204
learning which is known as a
reinforcement.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6824-0
00:41:11.814 --> 00:41:15.923
I hope this explains reasonably,
and let's look at the relation

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6824-1
00:41:15.923 --> 00:41:19.968
between data science and machine
learning from one of the most

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6824-2
00:41:19.968 --> 00:41:23.306
famous authors of machine
learning books called Tom

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6824-3
00:41:23.306 --> 00:41:23.884
Mitchell.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6831-0
00:41:25.504 --> 00:41:27.994
And this is probably self
explanatory.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6858-0
00:41:28.524 --> 00:41:33.473
So all we are saying is that we
say that the machine is learning

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6858-1
00:41:33.473 --> 00:41:38.041
if machine gains experience and
starts performing task with

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6858-2
00:41:38.041 --> 00:41:39.564
greater performance.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6874-0
00:41:40.934 --> 00:41:44.721
So that is so we have an element
of a task experience and

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6874-1
00:41:44.721 --> 00:41:45.504
performance.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6889-0
00:41:45.794 --> 00:41:50.339
Then we say that we have trained
a machine to perform the task

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6889-1
00:41:50.339 --> 00:41:50.844
better.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6896-0
00:41:50.934 --> 00:41:53.714
So then we say that machine
learning has happened.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6941-0
00:42:00.834 --> 00:42:04.922
And hobbies machine learning
different from a traditional

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6941-1
00:42:04.922 --> 00:42:09.222
programming in a traditional
programming that all of you may

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6941-2
00:42:09.222 --> 00:42:13.874
be familiar, we have a data that
we want to process and we have a

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6941-3
00:42:13.874 --> 00:42:15.354
program in the logic.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6944-0
00:42:18.394 --> 00:42:18.964
So.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6950-0
00:42:19.014 --> 00:42:20.324
So what is the for?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6956-0
00:42:20.534 --> 00:42:21.384
What is the?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6966-0
00:42:22.094 --> 00:42:25.954
Let us look at let us look at
this output.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6973-0
00:42:26.154 --> 00:42:28.384
So so let us take a bank
example.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6981-0
00:42:30.324 --> 00:42:31.894
So we are saying that balance.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6987-0
00:42:34.124 --> 00:42:36.614
And then interest rates?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6992-0
00:42:39.724 --> 00:42:42.744
And uh calculations in
algorithms.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/6999-0
00:42:44.924 --> 00:42:46.644
And then accrual.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7002-0
00:42:49.054 --> 00:42:50.734
Of interest.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7020-0
00:42:53.014 --> 00:42:58.294
Two accounts, so this is a case
of a traditional programming.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7040-0
00:42:59.314 --> 00:43:05.166
So now, now let us say, let us
say we are saying that we have

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7040-1
00:43:05.166 --> 00:43:07.714
the bank has many products.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7046-0
00:43:13.634 --> 00:43:15.044
Bank has many products.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7068-0
00:43:15.054 --> 00:43:20.743
We are taking the bank example
and we have the the users or

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7068-1
00:43:20.743 --> 00:43:25.674
users or buyers of those
products, so demographics.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7074-0
00:43:31.524 --> 00:43:32.564
Of customers.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7080-0
00:43:35.174 --> 00:43:37.314
Yielding the products.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7086-0
00:43:40.064 --> 00:43:41.814
And in model.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7089-0
00:43:43.934 --> 00:43:44.174
2.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7093-0
00:43:46.354 --> 00:43:47.144
Cross sell.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7096-0
00:43:50.154 --> 00:43:50.474
Perfect.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7101-0
00:43:58.194 --> 00:43:58.784
Does it?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7118-0
00:43:58.794 --> 00:44:01.583
Does it explain what is the
difference between a traditional

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7118-1
00:44:01.583 --> 00:44:02.954
programming and machine learn?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7154-0
00:44:04.674 --> 00:44:09.966
So here we are building we are
we have a data and from the data

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7154-1
00:44:09.966 --> 00:44:15.009
and then the possibly the the
type of people who have bought

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7154-2
00:44:15.009 --> 00:44:16.084
the products.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7189-0
00:44:16.414 --> 00:44:20.184
So we what we are able to do is
that we are able to generate a

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7189-1
00:44:20.184 --> 00:44:23.775
model that is going to help us
in promoting the products in

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7189-2
00:44:23.775 --> 00:44:24.194
future.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7210-0
00:44:25.114 --> 00:44:27.817
But in this case what we had
done in a traditional

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7210-1
00:44:27.817 --> 00:44:30.254
programming is we have done the
calculations.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7216-0
00:44:32.094 --> 00:44:33.954
Necessity for our purpose.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7222-0
00:44:39.284 --> 00:44:41.104
And the types of ML.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7231-0
00:44:43.034 --> 00:44:44.324
Can be supervised.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7273-0
00:44:44.914 --> 00:44:49.894
So given training data, we are
going to, we are going to get,

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7273-1
00:44:49.894 --> 00:44:55.034
we are going to generate a model
that is going to that is going

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7273-2
00:44:55.034 --> 00:45:00.094
to help us in doing a task which
is known as a classification.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7289-0
00:45:00.984 --> 00:45:04.254
So we are, we are going to
define that as we go along, OK.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7303-0
00:45:04.434 --> 00:45:08.871
And unsupervised, unsupervised
is that we have a lot of

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7303-1
00:45:08.871 --> 00:45:11.644
training data and can we
discover.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7308-0
00:45:16.304 --> 00:45:17.554
She didn't patterns.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7323-0
00:45:23.014 --> 00:45:25.284
And then there can be something
in between.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7349-0
00:45:25.554 --> 00:45:29.356
So we have a small amount of
training training data with

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7349-1
00:45:29.356 --> 00:45:33.557
class labels or outputs and a
lot of training data without any

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7349-2
00:45:33.557 --> 00:45:34.024
labels.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7365-0
00:45:34.334 --> 00:45:38.135
So in that case, we can combine
the top two algorithms to

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7365-1
00:45:38.135 --> 00:45:39.314
generate insights.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7382-0
00:45:42.064 --> 00:45:46.790
Can you give a real life example
for supervised and unsupervised

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7382-1
00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:47.444
learning?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7408-0
00:45:47.634 --> 00:45:52.854
Yes, yes, A is it fine if I do
that after 10-15 minutes.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7405-0
00:45:52.404 --> 00:45:54.094
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7410-0
00:45:54.144 --> 00:45:54.604
Sure, sure.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7412-0
00:45:54.594 --> 00:45:55.634
OK, alright.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7432-0
00:45:56.794 --> 00:46:00.261
And then a reinforcement
learning is an example where we

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7432-1
00:46:00.261 --> 00:46:02.754
are training the machine to
drive a car.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7466-0
00:46:04.024 --> 00:46:10.256
So we are telling that if you,
if you if you are meeting in, so

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7466-1
00:46:10.256 --> 00:46:16.390
if you go very close to another
vehicle, there is a penalty or

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7466-2
00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:16.974
or so.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7484-0
00:46:17.064 --> 00:46:20.856
So that the machine needs to
recognize and the machine goes

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7484-1
00:46:20.856 --> 00:46:21.994
at a steady speed.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7489-0
00:46:22.464 --> 00:46:24.044
Then there is a reward.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7492-0
00:46:24.934 --> 00:46:26.564
And so on.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7498-0
00:46:26.574 --> 00:46:28.244
So similarly for a game.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7550-0
00:46:28.494 --> 00:46:32.394
So suppose that it's a
competitive game like chess, so

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7550-1
00:46:32.394 --> 00:46:36.222
there is a reward if you are
going to kill one of the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7550-2
00:46:36.222 --> 00:46:40.830
opponents pieces and there is a
reward and there is a loss of or

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7550-3
00:46:40.830 --> 00:46:45.084
there is a penalty if you lose
some of the your own pieces.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7579-0
00:46:45.484 --> 00:46:49.521
So essentially, based on the
rewards that that are going to

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7579-1
00:46:49.521 --> 00:46:53.691
come out of these steps, the
machine is going to learn how to

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7579-2
00:46:53.691 --> 00:46:55.104
perform the activity.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7601-0
00:46:55.464 --> 00:47:00.119
So the same thing applies when
when a robo has to travel

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7601-1
00:47:00.119 --> 00:47:02.324
through a a hazardous June.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7610-0
00:47:04.814 --> 00:47:07.114
OK, so this is a.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7621-0
00:47:07.354 --> 00:47:11.804
This is possibly a example taken
from one of the websites.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7625-0
00:47:12.174 --> 00:47:13.214
That website is given.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7638-0
00:47:14.024 --> 00:47:17.008
So supervised, unsupervised and
reinforcement, the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7638-1
00:47:17.008 --> 00:47:17.944
differentiation.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7653-0
00:47:30.584 --> 00:47:34.394
And and I hope by now I do not
need to explain.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7709-0
00:47:34.404 --> 00:47:39.083
I was hoping that if by now the
point is not clear, we can

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7709-1
00:47:39.083 --> 00:47:43.049
understand what is the
difference between typical

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7709-2
00:47:43.049 --> 00:47:48.125
people who are going to look at
reports who are going to create

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7709-3
00:47:48.125 --> 00:47:52.407
aggregates and create MIS
reports and create a lot of

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7709-4
00:47:52.407 --> 00:47:56.214
create clots from the data
within the database.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7718-0
00:47:56.484 --> 00:47:58.304
So what exactly is the response?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7731-0
00:47:58.714 --> 00:48:04.474
The difference between what they
do and what what data scientists

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7731-1
00:48:04.474 --> 00:48:05.434
often does.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7756-0
00:48:11.604 --> 00:48:15.732
So I had a question that the
what is the difference between

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7747-0
00:48:14.644 --> 00:48:14.794
Yes.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7756-1
00:48:15.732 --> 00:48:17.864
the labeled and unlabeled data?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7772-0
00:48:18.574 --> 00:48:21.614
As we mentioned in the last
slide.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7763-0
00:48:20.014 --> 00:48:20.474
OK, OK.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7770-0
00:48:21.254 --> 00:48:22.804
Yes, yes, yes, yes, OK.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7789-0
00:48:22.814 --> 00:48:26.246
OK, labeled and unlabeled data,
I'm going to I'm going to tell

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7789-1
00:48:26.246 --> 00:48:26.464
you.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7798-0
00:48:26.834 --> 00:48:31.924
So suppose that suppose that we
have data.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7806-0
00:48:33.564 --> 00:48:35.814
About, let's see.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7811-0
00:48:36.604 --> 00:48:38.934
Let's say we have the.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7822-0
00:48:39.244 --> 00:48:42.174
Let me go back again since we
talked about an example.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7854-0
00:48:42.364 --> 00:48:46.502
So we have a data you are a
part, a data scientist in a team

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7854-1
00:48:46.502 --> 00:48:50.504
which is trying to predict which
party is going to win the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7854-2
00:48:50.504 --> 00:48:51.114
election.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7948-0
00:48:51.604 --> 00:48:55.753
So you have a complete voter
list for the constituency, but

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7948-1
00:48:55.753 --> 00:48:59.832
then you have only done survey
and then you think that the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7948-2
00:48:59.832 --> 00:49:04.257
constituency has about 3,00,000
people and you have done survey

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7948-3
00:49:04.257 --> 00:49:08.682
with about 3000 people and for
those 3000 people you think that

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7948-4
00:49:08.682 --> 00:49:13.176
you know whom they are going to
vote for based on because though

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7948-5
00:49:13.176 --> 00:49:17.325
The thing is that the voting
that they do is secret but you

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7948-6
00:49:17.325 --> 00:49:21.542
believe that they give you a
true answer to you or does that

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7948-7
00:49:21.542 --> 00:49:22.994
answer your question?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7958-0
00:49:28.054 --> 00:49:29.114
Who has asked the question?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7960-0
00:49:29.274 --> 00:49:29.944
Yes, yes, Sir.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7963-0
00:49:31.574 --> 00:49:32.024
Yes.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/7969-0
00:49:32.034 --> 00:49:33.284
Right, Mr evil?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8019-0
00:49:33.294 --> 00:49:37.905
So what we are saying is that
these 3000 elements are labeled

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8019-1
00:49:37.905 --> 00:49:42.739
samples labeled in data elements
or labeled data objects or data

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8019-2
00:49:42.739 --> 00:49:46.904
records and the remaining
2,97,000 data objects or data

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8019-3
00:49:46.904 --> 00:49:50.474
records that you have they do
not have a label.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8025-0
00:49:52.134 --> 00:49:53.494
Focus on this, yeah.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8027-0
00:49:54.094 --> 00:49:55.794
Alright so.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8039-0
00:49:58.114 --> 00:50:00.044
Uh yes, Mr VENKATRAMAN, that is
correct.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8054-0
00:50:00.054 --> 00:50:03.263
You know the output, assuming
that the label is the most

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8054-1
00:50:03.263 --> 00:50:04.164
important thing.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8059-0
00:50:04.174 --> 00:50:05.034
Yes, you know the output.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8080-0
00:50:12.864 --> 00:50:18.954
Now let us look at a little
understanding of what is the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8080-1
00:50:18.954 --> 00:50:20.984
data in enterprise.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8124-0
00:50:21.494 --> 00:50:27.275
So this maybe you are some of
you may be very comfortable but

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8124-1
00:50:27.275 --> 00:50:32.497
then it makes sense that we talk
about it at the in the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8124-2
00:50:32.497 --> 00:50:38.464
introduction session so so any
enterprise you have lot of data.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8144-0
00:50:38.474 --> 00:50:46.571
So today we have a lot of data
to the enterprises have lot of

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8144-1
00:50:46.571 --> 00:50:47.224
data.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8155-0
00:50:50.104 --> 00:50:55.884
And Dominion Enterprises are
keen on data driven.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8159-0
00:50:59.514 --> 00:51:00.364
Decision making.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8182-0
00:51:03.294 --> 00:51:07.590
They're keen, at least that is
how we see, at least in the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8182-1
00:51:07.590 --> 00:51:09.264
records or the reports.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8201-0
00:51:09.694 --> 00:51:13.844
So now, now let us see what is
the type of data that they have.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8208-0
00:51:15.094 --> 00:51:16.864
Uh, so big it can be.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8227-0
00:51:16.874 --> 00:51:22.016
They may have structured data,
so typically the structured data

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8227-1
00:51:22.016 --> 00:51:26.354
most popular repository for
structured data is RDBMS.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8245-0
00:51:29.104 --> 00:51:34.914
Which stores the data in a
tabular form, so it tabular form

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8245-1
00:51:34.914 --> 00:51:35.204
is.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8255-0
00:51:38.224 --> 00:51:42.774
So so now we are saying uh, the
age.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8261-0
00:51:44.564 --> 00:51:47.414
Qualification and designation.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8271-0
00:51:49.584 --> 00:51:51.614
So maybe we can have an employee
ID.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8288-0
00:51:55.644 --> 00:51:58.794
So what we have done is that we
have created tabular data.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8334-0
00:51:58.804 --> 00:52:03.957
Each row is representing one
employee and it is going to give

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8334-1
00:52:03.957 --> 00:52:09.360
that employee details and RDBMS
are best suited for storing such

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8334-2
00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:14.679
data and we have a lot of data
that is being generated which is

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8334-3
00:52:14.679 --> 00:52:16.674
of the form JSON or XML.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8345-0
00:52:18.494 --> 00:52:21.324
So this is often referred as
semi structured data.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8379-0
00:52:21.784 --> 00:52:26.399
So where this structure is not
strongly defined like an RDBMS,

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8379-1
00:52:26.399 --> 00:52:30.940
but structure is approximately
defined in the sense that each

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8379-2
00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:32.844
record has some structure.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8395-0
00:52:33.234 --> 00:52:36.045
But there is some variation
between the record to record

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8395-1
00:52:36.045 --> 00:52:37.524
with respect to the structure.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8400-0
00:52:38.624 --> 00:52:40.514
Then there is unstructured data.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8416-0
00:52:40.624 --> 00:52:47.981
There is a lot of unstructured
data and this includes so all

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8416-1
00:52:47.981 --> 00:52:48.584
text.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8420-0
00:52:51.784 --> 00:52:52.514
Multimedia.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8451-0
00:52:55.454 --> 00:53:00.136
So there is a lot of data that
is being generated today

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8451-1
00:53:00.136 --> 00:53:05.319
nowadays, which is going into
the unstructured data and it is

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8451-2
00:53:05.319 --> 00:53:06.824
growing very fast.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8489-0
00:53:07.494 --> 00:53:11.849
So today, if you look at a
typical organization, they may

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8489-1
00:53:11.849 --> 00:53:16.204
not have even 10% structured
data and it is possible that

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8489-2
00:53:16.204 --> 00:53:20.633
what they have is a 90% is
unstructured data or maybe even

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8489-3
00:53:20.633 --> 00:53:21.234
more so.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8499-0
00:53:21.304 --> 00:53:23.254
So let us take again.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8516-0
00:53:23.264 --> 00:53:26.014
We'll go back to the one example
we had talked about some time

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8516-1
00:53:26.014 --> 00:53:26.974
back, which is a bank.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8523-0
00:53:28.124 --> 00:53:29.854
So now for bank.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8527-0
00:53:29.864 --> 00:53:31.104
What is the structured data?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8548-0
00:53:33.564 --> 00:53:37.318
So it can be employees of the
bank, it can be the customers of

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8548-1
00:53:37.318 --> 00:53:37.854
the bank.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8558-0
00:53:38.024 --> 00:53:39.734
It can be the accounts of the
balance.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8564-0
00:53:39.744 --> 00:53:41.344
They are all representing
structured data.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8613-0
00:53:41.354 --> 00:53:45.237
They're not going to have a
identical structure for each one

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8613-1
00:53:45.237 --> 00:53:48.930
of them, and they're going to
store the columns and their

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8613-2
00:53:48.930 --> 00:53:52.940
values and the tabular form, and
then they can do perform many

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8613-3
00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:55.614
operations on that, then semi
structured.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8650-0
00:53:55.974 --> 00:53:59.052
Suppose that there are many
banks which need to exchange

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8650-1
00:53:59.052 --> 00:54:01.914
data because there are many
times at least the check

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8650-2
00:54:01.914 --> 00:54:05.262
processing and fund transfer
which keep happening between the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8650-3
00:54:05.262 --> 00:54:05.964
bank to bank.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8661-0
00:54:06.484 --> 00:54:09.337
So they need to do a
reconciliation between the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8661-1
00:54:09.337 --> 00:54:09.694
banks.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8687-0
00:54:10.104 --> 00:54:14.427
So now it is possible that not
all banks will have the same

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8687-1
00:54:14.427 --> 00:54:15.724
identical systems.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8705-0
00:54:16.394 --> 00:54:19.336
And even if even if they use
identical technologies, they

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8705-1
00:54:19.336 --> 00:54:21.364
design of the system will be
different.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8730-0
00:54:21.874 --> 00:54:26.294
So in one bank, the account may
store some 50 attributes and in

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8730-1
00:54:26.294 --> 00:54:29.264
another bank they may store 65
attributes.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8760-0
00:54:29.274 --> 00:54:32.150
So it is possible that there can
be different set of attributes

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8760-1
00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:34.845
that are stored and then the
meanings of the attributes can

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8760-2
00:54:34.845 --> 00:54:35.654
also be different.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8801-0
00:54:36.544 --> 00:54:41.024
So when they try to exchange the
data for the respect to the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8801-1
00:54:41.024 --> 00:54:45.283
interbank transactions, so they
need to depend on what is

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8801-2
00:54:45.283 --> 00:54:48.734
generally XML exchanges, that is
what they do.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8825-0
00:54:49.124 --> 00:54:53.663
So the XML or JSON exchanges
will help them decode the data

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8825-1
00:54:53.663 --> 00:54:57.294
that the other bank has sent
that they need to.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8831-0
00:54:57.804 --> 00:54:59.564
So now unstructured data.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8847-0
00:54:59.754 --> 00:55:02.708
So can somebody tell me what is
the unstructured data that the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8847-1
00:55:02.708 --> 00:55:03.364
bank may have?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8850-0
00:55:04.784 --> 00:55:05.714
Customer feedbacks.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8856-0
00:55:07.454 --> 00:55:08.544
Customer feedback.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8865-0
00:55:08.554 --> 00:55:11.134
It may also be structured, but
it may be unstructured.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8869-0
00:55:11.144 --> 00:55:11.804
I agree with you.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8886-0
00:55:11.854 --> 00:55:13.834
Yes, because sometimes they mean
right, yes.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8891-0
00:55:12.164 --> 00:55:15.034
Customer photo photo.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8884-0
00:55:13.274 --> 00:55:14.014
Excuse me. Don't talk.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8918-0
00:55:15.184 --> 00:55:20.564
Go to their signature digital
signatures they make.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8897-0
00:55:17.934 --> 00:55:18.604
Signatures.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8905-0
00:55:18.614 --> 00:55:18.964
Right.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8909-0
00:55:19.004 --> 00:55:19.484
Pictures.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8911-0
00:55:19.224 --> 00:55:19.994
Yeah, voice stream.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8912-0
00:55:19.494 --> 00:55:20.174
Pictures, right?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8914-0
00:55:21.414 --> 00:55:21.824
Yeah.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8920-0
00:55:21.884 --> 00:55:22.224
Yeah.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8934-0
00:55:21.954 --> 00:55:22.484
Can you repeat?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8944-0
00:55:22.464 --> 00:55:24.624
Can you repeat the voice thing?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8940-0
00:55:23.214 --> 00:55:24.294
Is that voice stream?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8942-0
00:55:24.964 --> 00:55:25.274
Yeah.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8946-0
00:55:25.284 --> 00:55:26.074
Voice recordings.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8948-0
00:55:26.084 --> 00:55:27.214
Yes, yes, right.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8951-0
00:55:27.724 --> 00:55:28.184
What more?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8963-0
00:55:29.854 --> 00:55:30.774
Here we see dogs.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8965-0
00:55:30.444 --> 00:55:31.484
Everything goes.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8972-0
00:55:33.024 --> 00:55:33.444
Yes.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9014-0
00:55:33.454 --> 00:55:38.052
So there are many images and
many images that they need to

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8974-0
00:55:33.574 --> 00:55:33.904
Yes.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/8986-0
00:55:33.914 --> 00:55:35.234
So there aren't many images.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9014-1
00:55:38.052 --> 00:55:42.729
keep and for example they are
also expected to keep a video

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9014-2
00:55:42.729 --> 00:55:45.924
recording of or the ATM's or the
branch.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9074-0
00:55:45.934 --> 00:55:48.798
What happens right and it is
possible that the law

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9040-0
00:55:47.944 --> 00:55:50.004
Chat with chat with customer
support.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9074-1
00:55:48.798 --> 00:55:52.111
enforcement agency may say that
you need to keep the video

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9074-2
00:55:52.111 --> 00:55:55.424
recording for the last six
months because if any report is

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9074-3
00:55:55.424 --> 00:55:58.513
there or any any compliant is
there, so they need they

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9074-4
00:55:58.513 --> 00:56:00.534
possibly wants to go back,
correct.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9082-0
00:56:01.024 --> 00:56:03.294
So all such data is unstructured
data.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9094-0
00:56:03.584 --> 00:56:07.454
So now you can tell based on
what we discussed.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9115-0
00:56:07.464 --> 00:56:10.808
So what is the what is likely to
be the percentage of the banks

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9115-1
00:56:10.808 --> 00:56:11.644
structured data?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9133-0
00:56:11.654 --> 00:56:15.441
This will be much smaller than
the video recording that they

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9133-1
00:56:15.441 --> 00:56:18.234
have to store because they they
may have to.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9153-0
00:56:18.694 --> 00:56:22.554
A A refer back for some law
enforcement or for some other

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9153-1
00:56:22.554 --> 00:56:24.484
reason for some other reason.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9175-0
00:56:24.494 --> 00:56:28.846
Also, they may go back and they
may have to check the videos so

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9175-1
00:56:28.846 --> 00:56:31.634
so the point is audio
recordings, right?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9184-0
00:56:31.644 --> 00:56:34.924
That is right, as you pointed
out.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9200-0
00:56:34.934 --> 00:56:38.203
Or you recordings legal
documents, chat logs, yes,

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9200-1
00:56:38.203 --> 00:56:39.164
emails, images.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9202-0
00:56:39.174 --> 00:56:39.764
Absolutely.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9245-0
00:56:39.774 --> 00:56:44.702
So so you are bringing in so
many examples where which they

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9245-1
00:56:44.702 --> 00:56:49.958
may have want to store and some
of those multimedia may be very

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9245-2
00:56:49.958 --> 00:56:54.804
heavy and me required lots and
lots of in a huge site huge

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9245-3
00:56:54.804 --> 00:56:55.214
site.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9269-0
00:56:55.534 --> 00:57:00.434
So when you have so much data,
so now now you maybe you may

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9269-1
00:57:00.434 --> 00:57:02.884
want to answer the next thing.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9286-0
00:57:03.194 --> 00:57:07.784
So the data may have a very
lying levels of return on byte.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9294-0
00:57:07.854 --> 00:57:09.494
So do you want to do anybody?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9326-0
00:57:09.504 --> 00:57:12.781
Does anybody want to comment on
the return on byte of various

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9326-1
00:57:12.781 --> 00:57:15.900
data elements that we have
talked about for a bank bank is

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9326-2
00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:18.014
something I think all of us
understand.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9337-0
00:57:20.574 --> 00:57:23.084
Second, no, repeat the question
return off.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9341-0
00:57:23.934 --> 00:57:25.544
Return on byte.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9357-0
00:57:25.834 --> 00:57:32.024
So suppose that you are storing
A1 MB for for some transaction.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9478-0
00:57:27.564 --> 00:57:27.714
But.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9379-0
00:57:32.554 --> 00:57:36.784
You are storing 1 GB for
something else, so one GB is

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9363-0
00:57:33.054 --> 00:57:33.194
Yeah.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9379-1
00:57:36.784 --> 00:57:38.664
about 1000 * 1 megabyte.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9386-0
00:57:38.894 --> 00:57:39.544
So.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9424-0
00:57:39.694 --> 00:57:43.369
So The thing is that when you
compare this data based on

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9395-0
00:57:39.834 --> 00:57:40.714
The structured data.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9424-1
00:57:43.369 --> 00:57:47.238
return on byte that one GB
should offer you 1000 times more

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9424-2
00:57:47.238 --> 00:57:50.784
value for the bank in terms of
something maybe profit.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9445-0
00:57:51.954 --> 00:57:55.031
So if they want to manage the
data or if they want to think

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9445-1
00:57:55.031 --> 00:57:56.774
about the importance of the
data.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9464-0
00:57:59.224 --> 00:58:00.524
So that means, like uh.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9479-0
00:58:00.324 --> 00:58:05.037
Even one KB of data is also more
important when we consider as a

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9479-1
00:58:05.037 --> 00:58:06.124
transaction so.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9480-0
00:58:06.114 --> 00:58:06.744
OK, right.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9483-0
00:58:07.054 --> 00:58:08.204
That is correct, right?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9490-0
00:58:08.314 --> 00:58:09.144
Absolutely right.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9506-0
00:58:09.204 --> 00:58:11.124
Mr Mahendra Nath Reddy, what you
said is absolutely.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9508-0
00:58:10.914 --> 00:58:12.694
So ohh the arouser.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9531-0
00:58:12.704 --> 00:58:16.996
That means that the inside which
we are gaining by analyzing the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9531-1
00:58:16.996 --> 00:58:21.024
data in whichever method that
should be like a quantifiable.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9537-0
00:58:22.914 --> 00:58:23.584
It is.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9541-0
00:58:23.634 --> 00:58:24.544
See. See.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9560-0
00:58:24.554 --> 00:58:27.432
In fact, if you ask a CEO, CEO
will want everything to be

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9560-1
00:58:27.432 --> 00:58:28.424
quantifiable, right?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9572-0
00:58:29.484 --> 00:58:30.314
Or do you have some doubts?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9581-0
00:58:31.354 --> 00:58:32.914
No, no, not that is correct.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9636-0
00:58:33.764 --> 00:58:37.989
OK, so the so the point is that
they will say that, OK, we have

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9636-1
00:58:37.989 --> 00:58:41.686
spent $1,000,000 in deploying
areas, fancy data science

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9636-2
00:58:41.686 --> 00:58:45.581
system, a machine learning and
some system and now now the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9636-3
00:58:45.581 --> 00:58:49.277
point is that what is the
increase in the enrollment of

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9636-4
00:58:49.277 --> 00:58:52.974
customers, that is what the CEO
is going to say, right?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9651-0
00:58:56.164 --> 00:59:00.774
So last last quarter we have got
10,000 new customers.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9673-0
00:59:01.144 --> 00:59:05.910
So in this quarter, after after
incorporating a fancy machine

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9673-1
00:59:05.910 --> 00:59:09.754
learning system, you got 9009
thousand customers.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9686-0
00:59:10.064 --> 00:59:12.144
You know the face of First EVO
will not be so good.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9713-0
00:59:18.014 --> 00:59:22.143
OK, so so the point is that the
return on byte Y I'm saying is

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9713-1
00:59:22.143 --> 00:59:24.764
that not all data is equally
important.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9738-0
00:59:25.124 --> 00:59:28.470
For example, bank needs to keep
video recording of all its ATMs,

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9738-1
00:59:28.470 --> 00:59:31.404
but then it is not going to make
any profit out of that.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9756-0
00:59:31.734 --> 00:59:35.904
So it has to do that because it
has to follow some regulation.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9760-0
00:59:36.174 --> 00:59:37.064
So it will do that.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9798-0
00:59:37.074 --> 00:59:41.027
It will do that, but then when
it comes to the analytics or

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9798-1
00:59:41.027 --> 00:59:45.045
giving lot of focus, so it is
possible as one of Mr Mahendra

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9798-2
00:59:45.045 --> 00:59:47.614
Nagar's pointing out the
transactions.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9804-0
00:59:47.814 --> 00:59:49.174
Believe they may focus.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9828-0
00:59:49.184 --> 00:59:51.927
For example, they may want to
find out which through which

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9828-1
00:59:51.927 --> 00:59:54.670
customer they're making a lot
more profit than which other

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9828-2
00:59:54.670 --> 00:59:55.414
customer, right?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9842-0
00:59:55.824 --> 00:59:58.406
So most probably they will be
interested in that type of

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9842-1
00:59:58.406 --> 00:59:58.814
analysis.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9857-0
00:59:58.994 --> 01:00:01.474
So the point is that the data
has a written on white.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9868-0
01:00:01.484 --> 01:00:03.674
All we want to understand is
that all data is not equal.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9872-0
01:00:04.934 --> 01:00:05.994
Not much more, OK.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9892-0
01:00:07.944 --> 01:00:11.270
And then data me have a acid
property, largely acid

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9892-1
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:11.974
properties.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9937-0
01:00:11.984 --> 01:00:14.986
Talking about relational
databases, implement a property

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9937-1
01:00:14.986 --> 01:00:17.882
called acid properties whereby
they guarantee that the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9937-2
01:00:17.882 --> 01:00:21.146
integrity of the data will never
be violated, and if multiple

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9937-3
01:00:21.146 --> 01:00:24.148
people access the data, they're
all going to say they're

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9937-4
01:00:24.148 --> 01:00:24.674
identical.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9942-0
01:00:24.734 --> 01:00:25.094
Feature.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9992-0
01:00:25.544 --> 01:00:29.760
But many times, for example, if
if you are working, if you are

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9992-1
01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:33.708
frequenting social media so you
know that in social media,

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9992-2
01:00:33.708 --> 01:00:37.857
suppose that you post a message
so you post a message and you

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/9992-3
01:00:37.857 --> 01:00:40.534
may call immediately your friend
in US.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10033-0
01:00:40.904 --> 01:00:44.439
That friend may not have seen
the message, even if the friend

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10033-1
01:00:44.439 --> 01:00:47.859
is logged into social media,
they may not have set seen the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10033-2
01:00:47.859 --> 01:00:51.565
message, particularly if you're
posted a video or or picture you

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10033-3
01:00:51.565 --> 01:00:52.534
call immediately.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10039-0
01:00:52.544 --> 01:00:53.594
They may not have seen it.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10049-0
01:00:53.844 --> 01:00:56.154
That is because it is not a.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10084-0
01:00:56.194 --> 01:01:00.386
Consistency is not so important
for setting data, so in that

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10084-1
01:01:00.386 --> 01:01:04.509
case what we call is a base
property which is that eventual

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10084-2
01:01:04.509 --> 01:01:06.364
consistency is good enough.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10138-0
01:01:06.844 --> 01:01:11.304
But as it property is immediate,
consistency is import and the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10138-1
01:01:11.304 --> 01:01:15.836
data may have another property
which is related to the velocity

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10138-2
01:01:15.836 --> 01:01:20.013
where we may deal with the
stream of data and we may still

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10138-3
01:01:20.013 --> 01:01:24.261
need to perform certain things
on some data may allow us to

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10138-4
01:01:24.261 --> 01:01:25.464
perform in batch.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10149-0
01:01:26.834 --> 01:01:30.534
Ah, so can you give example of
AC property?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10154-0
01:01:32.194 --> 01:01:33.204
Acid property.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10182-0
01:01:33.294 --> 01:01:37.972
Suppose that you are
transferring money from your

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10160-0
01:01:33.754 --> 01:01:34.004
You know.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10182-1
01:01:37.972 --> 01:01:43.866
account to another account of
your friend or or some vendor to

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10182-2
01:01:43.866 --> 01:01:44.334
whom?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10190-0
01:01:44.344 --> 01:01:45.634
From whom you bought a product.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10235-0
01:01:46.064 --> 01:01:49.859
So you are doing a transfer in
both you and your vendor have

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10235-1
01:01:49.859 --> 01:01:53.592
account in the same bank and
then when you are transferring

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10235-2
01:01:53.592 --> 01:01:57.698
letter, say you bought a product
and transferring ₹5000 rupees to

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10235-3
01:01:57.698 --> 01:01:58.444
your vendor.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10295-0
01:01:58.814 --> 01:02:03.508
So the acid property guarantees
that either both debit on your

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10295-1
01:02:03.508 --> 01:02:08.126
account and the credit on your
vendor accounts both happen or

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10295-2
01:02:08.126 --> 01:02:12.745
neither of them happen because
the communication link is back

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10295-3
01:02:12.745 --> 01:02:17.364
or the gateway is back, or the
server crashed for any reason.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10317-0
01:02:17.374 --> 01:02:21.618
The ACID properties guarantee
that either the transaction

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10317-1
01:02:21.618 --> 01:02:24.984
happens completely or does not
happen at all.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10324-0
01:02:25.154 --> 01:02:27.644
Thereby you stay inconsistent
state.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10354-0
01:02:27.974 --> 01:02:31.790
So if you are debited but your
vendor is not credited so that

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10354-1
01:02:31.790 --> 01:02:35.114
they say that the database is
not inconsistent state.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10361-0
01:02:35.934 --> 01:02:37.594
Miss Surbhi, have I answered the
question.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10364-0
01:02:38.774 --> 01:02:40.144
Uh, yes, thank you.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10372-0
01:02:50.104 --> 01:02:51.934
All right then.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10379-0
01:02:52.004 --> 01:02:54.314
Then we are talking about
databases.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10408-0
01:02:54.324 --> 01:03:00.713
Databases may have two broad
categories, so our RDBMS use SQL

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10408-1
01:03:00.713 --> 01:03:06.174
for querying and they are
referred as SQL databases.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10481-0
01:03:06.484 --> 01:03:11.908
Presently, because we have large
number of no SQL databases, they

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10481-1
01:03:11.908 --> 01:03:16.181
know SQL databases is a
phenomenon that is about 10

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10481-2
01:03:16.181 --> 01:03:21.605
years old or not 10 years, maybe
15 years old, but then they have

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10481-3
01:03:21.605 --> 01:03:26.453
caught up like anything and
today the no SQL databases are

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10481-4
01:03:26.453 --> 01:03:31.055
offering significant or hosting
significant data of the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10481-5
01:03:31.055 --> 01:03:36.314
organizations and SQL still is
the IS for all the transactions.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10512-0
01:03:36.324 --> 01:03:39.990
So for example, you want to
operate a system which does the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10512-1
01:03:39.990 --> 01:03:43.290
funds transfer or you are
operating a system which is

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10512-2
01:03:43.290 --> 01:03:44.634
doing a product sales.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10539-0
01:03:45.024 --> 01:03:49.567
Or if you are operating a system
which is doing a reservations,

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10539-1
01:03:49.567 --> 01:03:53.826
or if you are doing a, let us
say trading in Stock Exchange

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10539-2
01:03:53.826 --> 01:03:54.394
trading.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10563-0
01:03:54.644 --> 01:03:58.992
So in all these cases where the
consistency or the acid

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10563-1
01:03:58.992 --> 01:04:01.864
properties are very, very
essential.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10593-0
01:04:02.414 --> 01:04:06.891
So in such cases they will go
with either RDBMS implementation

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10593-1
01:04:06.891 --> 01:04:10.728
or they mean implement the
entire as RDBMS properties

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10593-2
01:04:10.728 --> 01:04:12.504
through their own coding.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10600-0
01:04:12.514 --> 01:04:13.284
That is also possible.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10616-0
01:04:14.234 --> 01:04:19.704
And then then we have the no SQL
databases, no SQL databases.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10643-0
01:04:19.714 --> 01:04:24.378
Take various forms and one of
the important characterization

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10643-1
01:04:24.378 --> 01:04:29.424
is that the no SQL databases can
be replicated to many locations.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10677-0
01:04:29.434 --> 01:04:33.241
If the RDBMS you replicate the
replication is going to

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10677-1
01:04:33.241 --> 01:04:37.325
incorporate, put a lot of cost
because the consistency and

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10677-2
01:04:37.325 --> 01:04:41.824
replication they are conflicting
demands and no skill databases.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10741-0
01:04:41.834 --> 01:04:46.587
They go with the base and
because of that what happens is

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10741-1
01:04:46.587 --> 01:04:51.586
that they offer larger volumes
and they support the eventual

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10741-2
01:04:51.586 --> 01:04:56.667
consistency and various forms of
and and generally the no SQL

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10741-3
01:04:56.667 --> 01:05:01.830
database also come with a lower
license fees compared to RDBMS

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10741-4
01:05:01.830 --> 01:05:05.354
because of the property, their
nature and.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10751-0
01:05:05.404 --> 01:05:08.724
And let's look at why go beyond
RDBMS.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10766-0
01:05:08.734 --> 01:05:12.154
So this is just an explanation
that we are looking at, yeah.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10777-0
01:05:14.334 --> 01:05:16.454
The I think we have already
talked about this.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10781-0
01:05:17.394 --> 01:05:18.464
So.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10824-0
01:05:18.694 --> 01:05:23.611
So The thing is that SQL it does
not scale very well and it is

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10824-1
01:05:23.611 --> 01:05:28.528
not suitable for semi structured
data though today all the SQL

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10824-2
01:05:28.528 --> 01:05:33.211
vendors claim that they are
hosting lake houses so they can

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10824-3
01:05:33.211 --> 01:05:35.474
also store unstructured data.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10834-0
01:05:35.484 --> 01:05:37.634
So you go to any RDBMS vendor.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10862-0
01:05:37.644 --> 01:05:42.422
They say that, OK, we can store
unstructured data so, but then

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10862-1
01:05:42.422 --> 01:05:46.214
they're not very effective or or
possibly it's a.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10876-0
01:05:46.254 --> 01:05:49.707
So just to store unstructured
data, you don't want to use

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10876-1
01:05:49.707 --> 01:05:50.064
RDBMS.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10891-0
01:05:50.074 --> 01:05:53.256
So to combine unstructured data,
unstructured data, maybe use

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10891-1
01:05:53.256 --> 01:05:53.564
RDBMS.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10920-0
01:05:54.224 --> 01:05:58.883
So these are the strengths and
weaknesses and this is a picture

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10920-1
01:05:58.883 --> 01:06:03.541
that is giving you the ranking
of the various DBMS vendors over

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10920-2
01:06:03.541 --> 01:06:04.924
the 10 year period.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10937-0
01:06:08.684 --> 01:06:12.536
And the URLs are given from
where you're going to this is

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10937-1
01:06:12.536 --> 01:06:12.934
taken.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10964-0
01:06:17.574 --> 01:06:22.156
And you can see that now within
the top ten, you got a database

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10964-1
01:06:22.156 --> 01:06:25.234
called MongoDB which is a no SQL
database.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10984-0
01:06:25.554 --> 01:06:31.531
So but if you go back ten years
ago, certainly there was no no

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/10984-1
01:06:31.531 --> 01:06:32.764
SQL database.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11049-0
01:06:32.774 --> 01:06:38.960
MongoDB existed at 19th place so
So what you can see is that many

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11049-1
01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:44.771
more noise SQL databases such as
NEO 4J which started in 2017

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11049-2
01:06:44.771 --> 01:06:50.582
Redis which started in 2018 and
so these all have started and

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11049-3
01:06:50.582 --> 01:06:56.674
they have grown to a significant
market share in last few years.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11056-0
01:06:57.224 --> 01:06:58.764
These are all new Esquel
examples.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11098-0
01:07:02.164 --> 01:07:07.417
So we need to understand that an
organization may have an

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11098-1
01:07:07.417 --> 01:07:12.759
organization will have many
diverse forms of data and I do

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11098-2
01:07:12.759 --> 01:07:18.374
not think that I need to explain
because this is giving you a

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11098-3
01:07:18.374 --> 01:07:20.004
list of diversity.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11104-0
01:07:26.274 --> 01:07:30.664
Examples of diverse data.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11155-0
01:07:41.404 --> 01:07:47.882
And maybe I will go or just
momentarily into a website just

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11155-1
01:07:47.882 --> 01:07:54.576
to just to give you a feel of
this may not be very maybe many

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11155-2
01:07:54.576 --> 01:08:01.054
of you are familiar, but I have
taken the example from AWS.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11237-0
01:08:01.354 --> 01:08:06.326
So all we are saying is that the
way they're looking at that data

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11237-1
01:08:06.326 --> 01:08:11.147
architecture, so that includes
relational databases and then no

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11237-2
01:08:11.147 --> 01:08:15.817
SQL databases which they call as
non relational databases and

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11237-3
01:08:15.817 --> 01:08:20.111
they have data warehouse and
they have the algorithms et

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11237-4
01:08:20.111 --> 01:08:24.856
cetera for processing the data
and they have logs which may be

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11237-5
01:08:24.856 --> 01:08:28.924
simple flag files and they may
incorporate data leak.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11262-0
01:08:29.274 --> 01:08:32.856
The data leak is essentially
unprocessed data that they

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11262-1
01:08:32.856 --> 01:08:36.885
receive from diverse sources and
which is not preprocessed but

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11262-2
01:08:36.885 --> 01:08:37.844
kept in a leak.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11280-0
01:08:37.854 --> 01:08:41.571
So essentially it is receiving
and holding so that you can

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11280-1
01:08:41.571 --> 01:08:43.964
process it at future as you
required.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11305-0
01:08:47.244 --> 01:08:51.102
So the there can be multiple
types of flows and they are

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11305-1
01:08:51.102 --> 01:08:52.794
talking about inside out.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11359-0
01:08:52.804 --> 01:08:57.066
There can be a flow of data
leaked to various of forms of

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11359-1
01:08:57.066 --> 01:09:01.181
this data and it is possible
that outside inflow may be

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11359-2
01:09:01.181 --> 01:09:05.369
happening and it is possible
that from these six sources

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11359-3
01:09:05.369 --> 01:09:09.263
there may be interexchange
between these six sources

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11359-4
01:09:09.263 --> 01:09:11.394
between themselves and so on.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11398-0
01:09:11.404 --> 01:09:15.595
So this is giving you an
indication about the diversity

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11398-1
01:09:15.595 --> 01:09:19.412
of the data that the
organizations boost and and I

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11398-2
01:09:19.412 --> 01:09:23.304
think that this may be a good
time to take a break.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11415-0
01:09:27.394 --> 01:09:29.854
So one question, when the slave
that you showed.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11419-0
01:09:30.804 --> 01:09:32.034
Are you you are.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11424-0
01:09:32.104 --> 01:09:33.524
You have to speak louder.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11434-0
01:09:33.574 --> 01:09:35.414
Your voice is coming with a lot
of noise.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11442-0
01:09:37.044 --> 01:09:38.164
Jesus talking university.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11453-0
01:09:39.964 --> 01:09:41.654
It is still not so clear.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11468-0
01:09:42.284 --> 01:09:45.914
I'm I'm unable to for the uh get
the words.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11462-0
01:09:43.074 --> 01:09:43.434
OK.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11474-0
01:09:47.254 --> 01:09:47.544
OK.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11479-0
01:09:47.554 --> 01:09:48.584
So real time, yeah.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11483-0
01:09:49.874 --> 01:09:51.164
You you make type.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11489-0
01:09:51.334 --> 01:09:52.464
I I don't know.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11507-0
01:09:52.474 --> 01:09:55.994
Mr Mahendra Nath Reddy, whether
I have a 2023 graph, maybe I'll

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11507-1
01:09:55.994 --> 01:09:56.764
have to check.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11510-0
01:09:57.814 --> 01:10:00.124
Uh, OK, alright.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11537-0
01:10:04.564 --> 01:10:08.460
So so I'm putting I'm I will
answer if Mr Babish CHANDRA's

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11537-1
01:10:08.460 --> 01:10:12.224
answer question, maybe I will
answer it after the break.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11546-0
01:10:12.384 --> 01:10:14.394
So now let us take 5 minute
break.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11552-0
01:10:24.394 --> 01:10:24.884
Thanks that's.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11614-0
01:16:05.804 --> 01:16:07.364
OK, there are many questions.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11631-0
01:16:07.374 --> 01:16:12.294
So just I think, let's let us go
one by one.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11639-0
01:16:12.304 --> 01:16:13.464
So I'm seeing that messages.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11658-0
01:16:14.804 --> 01:16:20.314
Ohh OK SOMYA Prabal wants to
move to the weakness and

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11658-1
01:16:20.314 --> 01:16:21.844
strength slide.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11662-0
01:16:22.814 --> 01:16:24.374
Uh, OK.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11678-0
01:16:24.634 --> 01:16:27.504
More than liquids, architecture
seem to unify this thing too.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11683-0
01:16:27.834 --> 01:16:28.824
Yeah, that is fine.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11732-0
01:16:28.834 --> 01:16:32.455
I I'm I'm fine that they are
trying to put them together and

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11732-1
01:16:32.455 --> 01:16:36.075
in fact you we are what we are
seeing is a data architecture

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11732-2
01:16:36.075 --> 01:16:39.636
proposed by AWS and you know
that AWS is very popular among

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11732-3
01:16:39.636 --> 01:16:40.764
many organizations.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11755-0
01:16:40.774 --> 01:16:44.806
I'm not saying this is the most,
but then even the other vendors

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11755-1
01:16:44.806 --> 01:16:48.094
must be offering a similar type
of structure, right?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11765-0
01:16:51.514 --> 01:16:53.444
That is already happening, Mr
Babish.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11780-0
01:16:53.454 --> 01:16:56.144
So because what we are seeing is
that there is a connection.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11798-0
01:16:56.234 --> 01:16:58.495
So unify means that there are
when there are multiple

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11798-1
01:16:58.495 --> 01:17:00.044
technologies, you cannot unify
them.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11835-0
01:17:00.234 --> 01:17:03.654
For example, you can make unique
machine and Windows machine talk

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11835-1
01:17:03.654 --> 01:17:06.296
to each other through
networking, and then you may

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11835-2
01:17:06.296 --> 01:17:09.509
make them share a lot of files,
but they're not protocols for

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11835-3
01:17:09.509 --> 01:17:10.234
sharing there.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11848-0
01:17:10.244 --> 01:17:12.926
But that doesn't mean that
unique and windows are going to

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11848-1
01:17:12.926 --> 01:17:13.744
become one, right?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11853-0
01:17:15.554 --> 01:17:16.444
OK.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11867-0
01:17:16.494 --> 01:17:20.694
So Mr Mahendra Nath says that
yes, lot of integration

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11867-1
01:17:20.694 --> 01:17:21.394
happened.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11871-0
01:17:21.404 --> 01:17:22.004
OK, fine.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11880-0
01:17:22.414 --> 01:17:26.434
And then Mr Sahil, Rajesh is
saying that.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11893-0
01:17:27.944 --> 01:17:35.154
OK, so fine, OHS, many services
and and then.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11915-0
01:17:37.204 --> 01:17:41.416
And then OK, there are some
comments about those comments,

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11915-1
01:17:41.416 --> 01:17:43.414
OK and no skill supports ML.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11920-0
01:17:43.424 --> 01:17:45.014
That is fine, absolutely.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11950-0
01:17:45.024 --> 01:17:48.356
Today, if you go to Oracle or
Microsoft, they're going to say

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11950-1
01:17:48.356 --> 01:17:51.634
that from their databases you
can perform all the EML tasks.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11970-0
01:17:51.704 --> 01:17:55.188
That is what they say, so it is
possible they provide you the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11970-1
01:17:55.188 --> 01:17:55.974
ways to do it.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11982-0
01:17:55.984 --> 01:18:01.224
Maybe you have to buy some extra
licenses and then then.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/11986-0
01:18:05.224 --> 01:18:06.154
OK, fine.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12063-0
01:18:06.164 --> 01:18:10.678
I'm I'm not commenting on that
because let us not go so deep

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12063-1
01:18:10.678 --> 01:18:14.822
into the each vendor, so that's
not really though I'm I

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12063-2
01:18:14.822 --> 01:18:19.336
appreciate your putting the
you're sharing the knowledge but

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12063-3
01:18:19.336 --> 01:18:23.924
we will not go into the specific
vendor and we are showing an

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12063-4
01:18:23.924 --> 01:18:28.364
example of a WS that does not
mean that AWS architecture is

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12063-5
01:18:28.364 --> 01:18:32.434
the best but we I have to choose
one I have to choose.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12072-0
01:18:32.844 --> 01:18:34.864
Alright, so now let us proceed
further.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12077-0
01:18:36.244 --> 01:18:37.724
Let us proceed further, alright.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12098-0
01:18:39.474 --> 01:18:46.098
So let us look at the let us
look at uh, like the data

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12098-1
01:18:46.098 --> 01:18:47.784
science roles.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12109-0
01:18:48.014 --> 01:18:52.264
So what we will do is that so so
for the.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12119-0
01:18:54.014 --> 01:18:55.874
Uh, let me go to.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12127-0
01:18:58.734 --> 01:18:59.114
OK.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12146-0
01:18:59.154 --> 01:19:04.649
So let us look at some what one
of the vendors is proposing the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12146-1
01:19:04.649 --> 01:19:05.164
rules.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12151-0
01:19:05.334 --> 01:19:07.224
So in fact I can.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12181-0
01:19:07.234 --> 01:19:10.975
I'm going to show at two places,
so the University of Berkeley,

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12181-1
01:19:10.975 --> 01:19:14.307
they're talking about, data
scientist, data analyst, and

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12181-2
01:19:14.307 --> 01:19:15.534
then a data engineer.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12189-0
01:19:16.374 --> 01:19:18.344
And they're giving us the roles.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12194-0
01:19:18.354 --> 01:19:18.864
What is it?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12219-0
01:19:18.874 --> 01:19:22.543
The data scientists examine
which questions need answers

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12219-1
01:19:22.543 --> 01:19:25.826
related to data, and they
require business acumen,

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12219-2
01:19:25.826 --> 01:19:27.564
analytics skills and so on.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12221-0
01:19:27.654 --> 01:19:28.064
OK.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12238-0
01:19:28.174 --> 01:19:31.330
And data analyst is bridging the
gap between data scientists and

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12238-1
01:19:31.330 --> 01:19:32.204
business analysts.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12245-0
01:19:32.344 --> 01:19:34.144
I hope that is self explanatory.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12250-0
01:19:34.694 --> 01:19:35.534
So they are.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12266-0
01:19:35.544 --> 01:19:40.089
They are better equipped to talk
to the business analysts or to

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12266-1
01:19:40.089 --> 01:19:41.154
the management.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12277-0
01:19:41.994 --> 01:19:44.184
And then data engineer is more
technical.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12303-0
01:19:44.194 --> 01:19:47.401
Person is focused on
development, deployment,

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12303-1
01:19:47.401 --> 01:19:51.723
management of data pipelines and
then similar thing is put in

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12303-2
01:19:51.723 --> 01:19:53.814
terms of in this website also.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12330-0
01:19:54.014 --> 01:19:58.131
So they are trying to put it in
the form of a so data scientist.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12330-1
01:19:58.131 --> 01:20:01.804
And what is it that you can
expect from a data scientist?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12356-0
01:20:01.814 --> 01:20:05.603
What are the preferred skills
for the data scientists and then

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12356-1
01:20:05.603 --> 01:20:09.392
a data scientist can be focusing
on machine learning or simply

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12356-2
01:20:09.392 --> 01:20:10.354
data journalist?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12367-0
01:20:10.364 --> 01:20:12.594
I do not take it is essentially
focus.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12385-0
01:20:12.604 --> 01:20:15.715
More on front end or the back
end, and then they're talking

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12385-1
01:20:15.715 --> 01:20:16.804
about data architect.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12457-0
01:20:16.814 --> 01:20:20.841
Data architect is there for
constructing the all the pieces

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12457-1
01:20:20.841 --> 01:20:25.002
and putting them together and
then data engineer who is going

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12457-2
01:20:25.002 --> 01:20:29.364
to implement the individual ETL
kind of skills and they need the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12457-3
01:20:29.364 --> 01:20:33.525
knowledge of SQL, No SQL and
then so on and they are going to

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12457-4
01:20:33.525 --> 01:20:37.686
the they're essentially data
architect, has a vision and then

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12457-5
01:20:37.686 --> 01:20:40.974
data engineer is possibly going
to implement it.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12471-0
01:20:42.544 --> 01:20:47.295
OK, I hope that gives a
reasonable understanding of the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12471-1
01:20:47.295 --> 01:20:47.804
rules.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12474-0
01:20:48.754 --> 01:20:49.024
Uh.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12481-0
01:20:51.494 --> 01:20:54.084
Uh, OK, OK.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12490-0
01:20:54.094 --> 01:20:57.864
I'm sorry one person is unable
to hear.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12537-0
01:20:58.154 --> 01:21:02.733
So, so OK, so I think the roles
and anyway there are many people

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12537-1
01:21:02.733 --> 01:21:06.959
I'm little concerned about
talking too much about the rules

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12537-2
01:21:06.959 --> 01:21:11.326
because in the organizations
they give the designations based

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12537-3
01:21:11.326 --> 01:21:12.664
on various factors.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12545-0
01:21:13.154 --> 01:21:15.874
So they may call for a small
organization.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12557-0
01:21:15.884 --> 01:21:18.014
They may have a data architect
doing everything.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12609-0
01:21:18.024 --> 01:21:22.481
They may call that person a data
scientist, and that person may

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12609-1
01:21:22.481 --> 01:21:26.729
have to do everything that is
related to data, whether it is

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12609-2
01:21:26.729 --> 01:21:31.117
ETL or whether it is building a
building a proposing an entire

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12609-3
01:21:31.117 --> 01:21:35.504
data architecture or or going to
create the UI or the visuals.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12618-0
01:21:35.514 --> 01:21:38.014
So they may have to do
everything so.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12636-0
01:21:38.104 --> 01:21:42.183
So The thing is, but then you
get a idea that what is the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12636-1
01:21:42.183 --> 01:21:42.534
type.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12651-0
01:21:42.544 --> 01:21:46.012
So the work that is involved and
programming is a must for data

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12651-1
01:21:46.012 --> 01:21:46.554
scientist.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12676-0
01:21:46.564 --> 01:21:48.074
This is really a question.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12702-0
01:21:48.244 --> 01:21:54.282
So for example I I can tell you
because I have been, so it's a

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12702-1
01:21:54.282 --> 01:21:56.774
I've been in industry for.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12708-0
01:21:58.504 --> 01:21:59.734
Very long time.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12715-0
01:21:59.744 --> 01:22:01.844
So so let me tell you something.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12733-0
01:22:02.084 --> 01:22:05.034
So there is always a culture it
it is pretty much an

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12733-1
01:22:05.034 --> 01:22:06.314
organizational culture.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12773-0
01:22:07.104 --> 01:22:12.688
So, uh, when I was working in
the West, what I have seen is

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12773-1
01:22:12.688 --> 01:22:18.645
that there are people at the age
of 60 years very keen on doing

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12773-2
01:22:18.645 --> 01:22:22.554
programming and and then there
are there.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12818-0
01:22:22.564 --> 01:22:26.351
If you look in many of the data
software services organizations,

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12818-1
01:22:26.351 --> 01:22:30.080
so it is possible that after 10
years of experience, the people

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12818-2
01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:33.402
will be working only with
spreadsheets and probably with

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12818-3
01:22:33.402 --> 01:22:37.014
the project management software
may not be doing programming.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12832-0
01:22:37.024 --> 01:22:41.114
So really there is nothing for
me to tell you what is required.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12844-0
01:22:41.124 --> 01:22:43.714
And now the question is data
scientist designation.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12897-0
01:22:43.964 --> 01:22:46.916
We have shown you what are the
skills, our expectations from

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12897-1
01:22:46.916 --> 01:22:50.109
some of the things one is coming
from the University of Berkeley,

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12897-2
01:22:50.109 --> 01:22:53.060
University of California at
Berkeley, and another one we are

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12897-3
01:22:53.060 --> 01:22:55.915
we we have seen is which is
coming from one of the vendors

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12897-4
01:22:55.915 --> 01:22:56.544
in this area.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12908-0
01:22:56.994 --> 01:23:00.244
So now whether how you want to
interpret?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12914-0
01:23:00.494 --> 01:23:01.764
I leave it to you anyway.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12930-0
01:23:01.774 --> 01:23:04.204
It is your organization which
tells what you should be doing.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12932-0
01:23:04.594 --> 01:23:06.344
Mr Virendra, have I answered
your question?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12951-0
01:23:08.174 --> 01:23:11.248
Because it's not for me to say
whether you should know Python

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12951-1
01:23:11.248 --> 01:23:11.644
for all.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12967-0
01:23:11.654 --> 01:23:14.244
For all you know, your
organization says that use are

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12967-1
01:23:14.244 --> 01:23:14.484
fine.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12987-0
01:23:14.534 --> 01:23:18.127
You you use are so now is our
higher level language or Python

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/12987-1
01:23:18.127 --> 01:23:19.054
is higher level.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13031-0
01:23:19.064 --> 01:23:23.325
I leave it to you because that's
it is possible that and then you

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13031-1
01:23:23.325 --> 01:23:27.457
may have a different opinion and
somebody may say that, OK, you

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13031-2
01:23:27.457 --> 01:23:31.007
may simply use a tool like a
vacca, and VACCA does not

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13031-3
01:23:31.007 --> 01:23:32.944
require you to do programming.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13042-0
01:23:32.954 --> 01:23:35.054
You can do it everything through
drag and drop.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13068-0
01:23:35.804 --> 01:23:38.559
So now do you call that
programming and if you perform a

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13068-1
01:23:38.559 --> 01:23:41.314
task using Weka, do you call
that you have done program?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13083-0
01:23:41.524 --> 01:23:47.321
So I I leave that those are all
those are all lot of HGH around

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13083-1
01:23:47.321 --> 01:23:47.774
that.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13086-0
01:23:47.874 --> 01:23:48.294
OK.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13102-0
01:23:48.344 --> 01:23:51.196
But then we can see that what
are the broad skills that are

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13102-1
01:23:51.196 --> 01:23:51.624
expected?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13110-0
01:23:53.374 --> 01:23:54.674
Alright, so I'll proceed
further.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13121-0
01:23:55.574 --> 01:23:57.824
So we will look at data science
activity examples.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13139-0
01:23:57.834 --> 01:24:00.621
So some of you have asked what
are the examples for

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13139-1
01:24:00.621 --> 01:24:02.764
classification examples for
clustering?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13145-0
01:24:02.854 --> 01:24:03.734
So we'll go through them.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13174-0
01:24:08.264 --> 01:24:13.236
Ohh, at this point at this point
I just want to see everybody's

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13174-1
01:24:13.236 --> 01:24:16.344
quite a maybe I'll continue
without my.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13197-0
01:24:16.384 --> 01:24:20.139
Maybe after another 15 minutes
or 20 minutes I will enable the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13197-1
01:24:20.139 --> 01:24:23.298
mic for everybody so that so
that we can interact if

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13197-2
01:24:23.298 --> 01:24:23.834
required.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13201-0
01:24:24.004 --> 01:24:24.944
I hope that's fine.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13220-0
01:24:29.684 --> 01:24:33.766
So we have talked about, uh, the
supervised machine learning,

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13220-1
01:24:33.766 --> 01:24:35.544
right, we are talked about.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13234-0
01:24:41.314 --> 01:24:44.864
And me and we have talked about
unsupervised ML.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13254-0
01:24:46.374 --> 01:24:50.903
We are going to see so the tasks
data science tasks that come

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13254-1
01:24:50.903 --> 01:24:54.044
under this are referred as
classification.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13258-0
01:24:56.974 --> 01:24:57.914
And prediction.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13273-0
01:25:00.974 --> 01:25:05.189
Uh performed with the help of
regression unsupervised, often

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13273-1
01:25:05.189 --> 01:25:06.294
the association.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13276-0
01:25:09.484 --> 01:25:10.564
And cluster.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13290-0
01:25:12.294 --> 01:25:14.184
And we'll see examples for each
one of them.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13322-0
01:25:14.794 --> 01:25:20.406
So classification is that given
a collection of records called

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13322-1
01:25:20.406 --> 01:25:25.306
as training set training data
set, so record sets have

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13322-2
01:25:25.306 --> 01:25:30.294
attributes and a class label
often referred as a label.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13349-0
01:25:31.124 --> 01:25:37.057
So when you have that we build a
model for those attributes that

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13349-1
01:25:37.057 --> 01:25:42.625
are going to help you predict
the class label for previously

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13349-2
01:25:42.625 --> 01:25:43.994
unseen records.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13359-0
01:25:44.424 --> 01:25:46.494
So now let us look at an
example.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13391-0
01:25:46.984 --> 01:25:51.965
So suppose that there is a tax
authorities, so tax authorities

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13391-1
01:25:51.965 --> 01:25:56.709
every year receive millions of
tax returns and they want to

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13391-2
01:25:56.709 --> 01:25:58.764
audit some of the returns.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13413-0
01:25:59.094 --> 01:26:02.359
Actually auditing can be a
costly process because they may

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13413-1
01:26:02.359 --> 01:26:04.904
have to check through your bank
transactions.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13446-0
01:26:05.334 --> 01:26:09.020
They may have to check through,
they may even have to check what

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13446-1
01:26:09.020 --> 01:26:12.649
are all the assets that you have
based on going through various

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13446-2
01:26:12.649 --> 01:26:15.484
records, property records and
many other records.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13473-0
01:26:15.854 --> 01:26:20.406
So complete audit may be a very
expensive process, so they may

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13473-1
01:26:20.406 --> 01:26:25.103
not want to do for all millions
of tax filings that happen every

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13473-2
01:26:25.103 --> 01:26:25.464
year.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13493-0
01:26:25.894 --> 01:26:30.260
So they want to do select some
tax filings and then they decide

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13493-1
01:26:30.260 --> 01:26:32.374
whether they should audit them.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13503-0
01:26:32.504 --> 01:26:35.604
So for that, let us say they
have been.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13544-0
01:26:35.944 --> 01:26:39.683
Ohh, they are seeing the tax
records for 100 years because

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13544-1
01:26:39.683 --> 01:26:43.232
there are from hundreds of years
people governments are

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13544-2
01:26:43.232 --> 01:26:47.224
collecting tax and in the past
also they wanted to collect tax

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13544-3
01:26:47.224 --> 01:26:47.794
honestly.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13553-0
01:26:47.804 --> 01:26:49.154
So they are saying that they
are.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13583-0
01:26:49.224 --> 01:26:52.074
They are auditing the tax
records, at least for some

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13583-1
01:26:52.074 --> 01:26:55.086
people and based on those
people, they are finding that

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13583-2
01:26:55.086 --> 01:26:57.344
some people are filing their tax
returns.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13602-0
01:26:57.354 --> 01:27:00.413
Honestly, some people are
underreporting the income and

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13602-1
01:27:00.413 --> 01:27:03.254
and then the government is
losing the tax revenues.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13630-0
01:27:03.624 --> 01:27:07.636
So you can have a class label,
so cheat is equal to no means

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13630-1
01:27:07.636 --> 01:27:11.516
they are filing the tax return
properly with reporting the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13630-2
01:27:11.516 --> 01:27:12.634
proper reporting.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13639-0
01:27:12.864 --> 01:27:14.874
Yes, means they are under
reporting the income.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13669-0
01:27:15.354 --> 01:27:19.220
So now based on all the audits
that they have done over the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13669-1
01:27:19.220 --> 01:27:22.635
last 100 years, suppose that
they identified set and

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13669-2
01:27:22.635 --> 01:27:23.344
attributes.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13680-0
01:27:27.834 --> 01:27:32.684
And the class label based on the
attributes.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13726-0
01:27:33.174 --> 01:27:36.952
So now using this data they can
create this is referred as

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13726-1
01:27:36.952 --> 01:27:40.665
training data because for this
data they already know the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13726-2
01:27:40.665 --> 01:27:44.571
output because the IT department
is most concerned about the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13726-3
01:27:44.571 --> 01:27:47.324
people who are under reporting
the income.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13743-0
01:27:47.784 --> 01:27:50.472
So they know the class label who
are reporting their income

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13743-1
01:27:50.472 --> 01:27:52.084
properly and who are not
reporting.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13780-0
01:27:52.454 --> 01:27:56.882
So now they can create a model
and based on the model they can

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13780-1
01:27:56.882 --> 01:28:01.520
predict for these people whether
they are likely to have reported

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13780-2
01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:04.964
the income properly or
underreported the income.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13800-0
01:28:05.034 --> 01:28:09.202
So it makes the job easy in
selecting the tax filings that

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13800-1
01:28:09.202 --> 01:28:10.474
should be audited.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13806-0
01:28:11.224 --> 01:28:12.644
So is the example clear?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13838-0
01:28:15.714 --> 01:28:20.022
I hope the example is clear, so
that is giving you an example of

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13838-1
01:28:20.022 --> 01:28:23.734
solving a classification
problems so that can help that

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13838-2
01:28:23.734 --> 01:28:24.794
tax authorities.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13847-0
01:28:25.324 --> 01:28:27.364
So now let us look at a few more
examples.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13861-0
01:28:29.554 --> 01:28:33.264
So direct marketing, so this can
be one example, OK.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13882-0
01:28:33.354 --> 01:28:36.087
So direct marketing, what you
want to do know is that for

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13882-1
01:28:36.087 --> 01:28:37.924
example, you are selling your
product.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13891-0
01:28:38.024 --> 01:28:40.884
So suppose that you are living
in Mumbai.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13906-0
01:28:41.134 --> 01:28:44.434
So Mumbai, I think has a
population of about more than

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13906-1
01:28:44.434 --> 01:28:45.034
one crore.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13915-0
01:28:45.364 --> 01:28:46.774
Ohh honey I 10 million.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13925-0
01:28:46.784 --> 01:28:48.634
I think it is possibly 20
million people.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13968-0
01:28:49.004 --> 01:28:52.278
So you are trying to sell the
product to them, so you can't go

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13968-1
01:28:52.278 --> 01:28:55.293
to every person in the 20
million people and then you are

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13968-2
01:28:55.293 --> 01:28:58.255
going to give a brochure or
promote your product or do a

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/13968-3
01:28:58.255 --> 01:28:59.814
demonstration of your product.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14000-0
01:29:00.204 --> 01:29:04.962
So you want to identify the
likely customers who are going

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14000-1
01:29:04.962 --> 01:29:09.801
to buy your product and then
that you are going to do based

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14000-2
01:29:09.801 --> 01:29:11.414
on the similar task.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14049-0
01:29:11.424 --> 01:29:15.872
So you're going to identify the
attributes and you're going to

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14049-1
01:29:15.872 --> 01:29:20.461
look at the data sets which are
indicating the people who bought

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14049-2
01:29:20.461 --> 01:29:24.626
your products, and thereby you
are going to do a selective

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14049-3
01:29:24.626 --> 01:29:25.614
target market.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14060-0
01:29:42.324 --> 01:29:42.724
On it.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14087-0
01:29:43.204 --> 01:29:47.489
I hope this is pretty much like
the previous example and we we

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14087-1
01:29:47.489 --> 01:29:51.774
are all comfortable with this,
so this can be another example.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14141-0
01:29:52.044 --> 01:29:55.296
So it is possible that there are
millions of credit card

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14141-1
01:29:55.296 --> 01:29:58.263
transactions that keep
happening, so it is possible

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14141-2
01:29:58.263 --> 01:30:01.915
that by using certain attributes
of the type of the transaction

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14141-3
01:30:01.915 --> 01:30:05.566
that is happening on the credit
card, looking at the history of

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14141-4
01:30:05.566 --> 01:30:07.734
the transactions that you are
making.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14166-0
01:30:08.024 --> 01:30:12.832
For example, you have been
buying a a groceries and let us

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14166-1
01:30:12.832 --> 01:30:17.313
say only groceries and
electronics and clothes for the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14166-2
01:30:17.313 --> 01:30:18.454
last 20 years.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14219-0
01:30:18.464 --> 01:30:21.917
You are a credit card customer
of the same company for the same

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14219-1
01:30:21.917 --> 01:30:25.424
credit card you're using for 20
years and only three things that

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14219-2
01:30:25.424 --> 01:30:28.661
you're buying either groceries
or clothes or electronics so

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14219-3
01:30:28.661 --> 01:30:31.844
suddenly they notice that there
is a huge transaction for.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14237-0
01:30:33.084 --> 01:30:39.814
Uh for a weapon in some country
in Africa on your credit card.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14248-0
01:30:40.004 --> 01:30:42.224
So there is a they have a reason
to suspect, right?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14308-0
01:30:42.554 --> 01:30:46.561
So you are only going in
Hyderabad to your neighborhood

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14308-1
01:30:46.561 --> 01:30:51.141
stores or to malls and you are
buying these set of products and

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14308-2
01:30:51.141 --> 01:30:54.575
after 20 years they have
suddenly seeing that a

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14308-3
01:30:54.575 --> 01:30:59.012
transaction happened in Africa
that and the person is and and

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14308-4
01:30:59.012 --> 01:31:00.514
also buying a weapon.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14331-0
01:31:00.964 --> 01:31:05.105
So it is possible that it is a
fraud, so they want to predict

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14331-1
01:31:05.105 --> 01:31:06.574
based on past history.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14345-0
01:31:07.304 --> 01:31:10.452
So similarly, the customer
attrition and Chun, so nobody

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14345-1
01:31:10.452 --> 01:31:12.054
wants to lose their customer.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14368-0
01:31:12.374 --> 01:31:15.331
So behave based on the
transactions or based on

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14368-1
01:31:15.331 --> 01:31:18.534
interactions with the customer
you want to predict.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14419-0
01:31:18.544 --> 01:31:21.960
Is it possible that this
customer is going to churn and

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14419-1
01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:25.499
based on that you may offer
promotional some promotion or

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14419-2
01:31:25.499 --> 01:31:29.098
find some way to retain the
customer because the getting a

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14419-3
01:31:29.098 --> 01:31:32.453
new customer is expensive
process, so you want to make

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14419-4
01:31:32.453 --> 01:31:34.954
sure that retain the existing
customers.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14431-0
01:31:35.244 --> 01:31:38.664
So this is again an application
for classification, then

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14431-1
01:31:38.664 --> 01:31:39.324
clustering.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14437-0
01:31:39.334 --> 01:31:40.664
Let us go for clustering.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14442-0
01:31:40.954 --> 01:31:42.774
This is unsupervised machine
learning.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14449-0
01:31:49.024 --> 01:31:50.194
So what are we doing?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14457-0
01:31:50.264 --> 01:31:51.934
We have a set of data points.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14461-0
01:31:52.044 --> 01:31:53.174
There is no label.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14470-0
01:31:58.004 --> 01:31:59.814
And there are set of attributes.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14516-0
01:32:01.344 --> 01:32:08.171
And the using the attributes you
identify identify that there are

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14516-1
01:32:08.171 --> 01:32:14.067
objects or data points data or
the OR the records victor

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14516-2
01:32:14.067 --> 01:32:20.894
similar to one another and which
are less similar to one another.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14531-0
01:32:22.474 --> 01:32:26.776
And you make create the majors
to find out the distance and

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14531-1
01:32:26.776 --> 01:32:27.564
similarity.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14547-0
01:32:27.874 --> 01:32:33.194
So we can take A and then let us
look at this data set.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14567-0
01:32:34.184 --> 01:32:39.290
So their intent of the
clustering is to identify from

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14567-1
01:32:39.290 --> 01:32:43.544
this data set that there are
three clusters.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14587-0
01:32:46.814 --> 01:32:51.255
Such a dot, the intracluster
distance is minimum and

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14587-1
01:32:51.255 --> 01:32:54.104
intercluster distance is
maximum.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14599-0
01:32:57.444 --> 01:33:00.594
So this is an example that may
help.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14645-0
01:33:00.664 --> 01:33:05.680
This is a I understand this is
100 year old example, so this

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14645-1
01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:10.450
was a plot that was made by
physician John Snow in London

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14645-2
01:33:10.450 --> 01:33:15.219
when there was an outbreak of
cholera, which is more than

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14645-3
01:33:15.219 --> 01:33:16.864
about 100 years ago.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14668-0
01:33:17.374 --> 01:33:23.646
So by studying this map, the
Doctor could identify what type

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14668-1
01:33:23.646 --> 01:33:27.244
of precautions and win which
area.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14700-0
01:33:27.874 --> 01:33:32.557
There is a large number of
vulnerable people and that may

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14700-1
01:33:32.557 --> 01:33:36.997
have helped the Government of
London in containing the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14700-2
01:33:36.997 --> 01:33:41.357
casualities and and and then
optimizing their medical

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14700-3
01:33:41.357 --> 01:33:42.164
resources.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14712-0
01:33:44.554 --> 01:33:47.534
So this we can consider as an
example of cluster.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14725-0
01:34:02.264 --> 01:34:05.094
And the clustering and
application can be market

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14725-1
01:34:05.094 --> 01:34:05.844
segmentation.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14757-0
01:34:06.844 --> 01:34:12.248
So what we are doing is that we
are identifying the customers

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14757-1
01:34:12.248 --> 01:34:16.868
and then based on set and
attributes and then we are

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14757-2
01:34:16.868 --> 01:34:20.354
creating the grouping of the
customers.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14769-0
01:34:20.364 --> 01:34:25.834
So for example, for example a
bank, a bank.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14783-0
01:34:30.984 --> 01:34:32.634
And I'm picking the same
example.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14786-0
01:34:33.184 --> 01:34:35.074
If bank me want.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14791-0
01:34:38.694 --> 01:34:40.094
To establish.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14794-0
01:34:42.814 --> 01:34:43.354
Platinum.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14802-0
01:34:47.034 --> 01:34:50.934
Gold and the silver
relationships.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14833-0
01:34:56.394 --> 01:34:59.533
So the bank maybe having 10
million customers, there are

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14833-1
01:34:59.533 --> 01:35:02.892
some banks in India which are
very large banks that may they

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14833-2
01:35:02.892 --> 01:35:04.544
may have 10 million customers.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14858-0
01:35:04.814 --> 01:35:08.532
So the what they want to do is
that they want to use some

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14858-1
01:35:08.532 --> 01:35:12.057
algorithmic approach whereby
they decide that platinum

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14858-2
01:35:12.057 --> 01:35:12.634
customer.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14888-0
01:35:15.404 --> 01:35:21.658
Each serviced by general manager
and gold customer is many

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14888-1
01:35:21.658 --> 01:35:26.004
serviced by manager and silver
customer.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14891-0
01:35:26.924 --> 01:35:28.324
It's serviced by executive.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14896-0
01:35:30.754 --> 01:35:31.144
Right.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14946-0
01:35:31.594 --> 01:35:36.955
So now what they want to do is
that they do not have any other

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14946-1
01:35:36.955 --> 01:35:41.805
basis, but they need to create 3
clusters such that that

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14946-2
01:35:41.805 --> 01:35:47.081
facilitates them in associating
the the bank at the customers

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14946-3
01:35:47.081 --> 01:35:50.484
with the suitable relationship
manager.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14952-0
01:35:51.454 --> 01:35:52.244
Not much more.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14956-0
01:35:52.504 --> 01:35:53.214
So he had.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14969-0
01:35:53.224 --> 01:35:56.566
There is really no supervision,
but then they can consider many

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14969-1
01:35:56.566 --> 01:35:56.984
factors.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/14978-0
01:35:56.994 --> 01:35:59.194
For example, how many products
the person is using?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15006-0
01:35:59.204 --> 01:36:02.049
How much money we are making
from that and what is the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15006-1
01:36:02.049 --> 01:36:04.841
potential for making future
money so that is the more

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15006-2
01:36:04.841 --> 01:36:05.824
important for bank.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15052-0
01:36:06.204 --> 01:36:10.374
So for example, you are a very
rich person, so even if you have

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15052-1
01:36:10.374 --> 01:36:14.348
a small relation, the possible
that they want to connect you

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15052-2
01:36:14.348 --> 01:36:18.192
with their general manager so
that the general manager can

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15052-3
01:36:18.192 --> 01:36:21.514
bring you in or make you
involved in new products.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15056-0
01:36:22.004 --> 01:36:22.554
So.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15090-0
01:36:22.604 --> 01:36:26.806
So the point is that the
clustering is an unsupervised,

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15090-1
01:36:26.806 --> 01:36:30.858
but is of course it has a
purpose and here is another

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15090-2
01:36:30.858 --> 01:36:34.084
clustering which is a document
clustering.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15134-0
01:36:34.374 --> 01:36:37.905
So, so many organizations which
have been business for decades,

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15134-1
01:36:37.905 --> 01:36:41.105
or even some organizations,
maybe in centuries, they will

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15134-2
01:36:41.105 --> 01:36:44.359
have millions of documents and
it is possible that they're

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15134-3
01:36:44.359 --> 01:36:45.904
digitized all the documents.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15160-0
01:36:46.334 --> 01:36:49.639
But then if you want to get
benefit out of those documents,

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15160-1
01:36:49.639 --> 01:36:52.944
it is not possible for you to
read the document end to end.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15196-0
01:36:53.004 --> 01:36:55.796
It's not possible for anyone to
read the documents end to end

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15196-1
01:36:55.796 --> 01:36:58.633
because that is going to take
away maybe 30 years of your time

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15196-2
01:36:58.633 --> 01:37:00.344
and then you can't afford to do
that.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15208-0
01:37:00.354 --> 01:37:01.774
And the company doesn't want you
to do that.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15244-0
01:37:02.404 --> 01:37:06.807
So you need to find a mechanism
whereby you're going to group

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15244-1
01:37:06.807 --> 01:37:10.784
the documents and so that you
will be able to find your

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15244-2
01:37:10.784 --> 01:37:13.624
related or interesting document
easily.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15264-0
01:37:13.884 --> 01:37:17.154
So it is possible that the
cluster and then suppose that

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15264-1
01:37:17.154 --> 01:37:19.564
I'm talking about in IT services
company.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15281-0
01:37:22.904 --> 01:37:27.094
I'm thinking a different example
so they are going to identify

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15281-1
01:37:27.094 --> 01:37:28.424
which are proposals.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15285-0
01:37:30.884 --> 01:37:32.064
Which are contracts.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15292-0
01:37:34.084 --> 01:37:35.664
Which are architecture
documents.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15305-0
01:37:38.374 --> 01:37:43.534
And which are design documents
which are test plans.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15334-0
01:37:43.964 --> 01:37:49.091
So this this will help making
use of the documents but it is

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15334-1
01:37:49.091 --> 01:37:54.134
not easy just to do that by
going manually do that do that.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15400-0
01:37:54.224 --> 01:37:57.943
So it is possible that you're
going to do a clustering based

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15400-1
01:37:57.943 --> 01:38:01.297
on the similarity of the
documents, and after that you

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15400-2
01:38:01.297 --> 01:38:05.016
maybe it may be able to find
that separate out the documents

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15400-3
01:38:05.016 --> 01:38:08.796
into different types and even
possible that after you do that

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15400-4
01:38:08.796 --> 01:38:12.577
clustering, you may even give a
label, for example the entire

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15400-5
01:38:12.577 --> 01:38:13.674
universe universe.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15427-0
01:38:14.044 --> 01:38:17.448
We say that it is consisting of
many galaxies and we say that we

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15427-1
01:38:17.448 --> 01:38:20.014
are living in a Galaxy that is
called Milky Way.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15436-0
01:38:20.384 --> 01:38:22.014
But then what is the definition
for it?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15442-0
01:38:22.144 --> 01:38:23.044
There is no definition.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15453-0
01:38:23.054 --> 01:38:24.684
All be the definition is very
simple.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15465-0
01:38:25.534 --> 01:38:29.724
The definition of galaxies and
the universe is coming.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15470-0
01:38:29.734 --> 01:38:31.654
Based on these two criteria,
nothing more.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15486-0
01:38:33.714 --> 01:38:36.882
But we say that we are living in
Milky Way but not in Andromeda,

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15486-1
01:38:36.882 --> 01:38:37.174
right?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15503-0
01:38:41.714 --> 01:38:45.345
And now we're going to another
unsupervised machine learning,

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15503-1
01:38:45.345 --> 01:38:46.984
which is called association.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15522-0
01:38:47.474 --> 01:38:52.520
So this is also sometimes it is
referred in some books as a

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15522-1
01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:54.454
Market Basket analysis.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15545-0
01:39:04.134 --> 01:39:08.971
So Market Basket analysis is
that so we want to see the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15545-1
01:39:08.971 --> 01:39:11.734
association rules from the data.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15554-0
01:39:12.424 --> 01:39:17.164
So it is quite possible that a
person buying bread.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15573-0
01:39:19.374 --> 01:39:23.144
If a person buys bread, the
person will also buy butter.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15622-0
01:39:23.754 --> 01:39:28.447
It is possible, so it can be a
valuable pattern for the grocery

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15622-1
01:39:28.447 --> 01:39:32.919
store owner, so finding such
patterns for particularly for a

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15622-2
01:39:32.919 --> 01:39:37.318
ecommerce vendor who has got
million products, if they find

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15622-3
01:39:37.318 --> 01:39:41.791
useful association rules, it may
enhance their business in a

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15622-4
01:39:41.791 --> 01:39:42.964
significant way.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15670-0
01:39:49.244 --> 01:39:53.815
OK, there is a question from Mr
Virendra Kumar Singh saying that

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15670-1
01:39:53.815 --> 01:39:58.105
what is the idea of distance in
cluster and in fact distance

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15670-2
01:39:58.105 --> 01:40:02.114
between objects is again a
distance that we are going to

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15670-3
01:40:02.114 --> 01:40:04.294
define using our own intuition.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15692-0
01:40:04.764 --> 01:40:10.888
So for example, you are, let us
say we are talking about the in

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15692-1
01:40:10.888 --> 01:40:12.514
a bank in a bank.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15709-0
01:40:12.524 --> 01:40:16.867
Then suppose that there are
three criteria that we want to

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15709-1
01:40:16.867 --> 01:40:18.854
use to create the distance.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15740-0
01:40:19.074 --> 01:40:23.431
One is the current the account
balance and one is that the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15740-1
01:40:23.431 --> 01:40:28.009
profit that the bank made from
the customer and the third one

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15740-2
01:40:28.009 --> 01:40:30.224
is the income of the customer.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15752-0
01:40:30.554 --> 01:40:33.204
So now it is for the bank to
decide that.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15780-0
01:40:33.214 --> 01:40:36.036
What is the weight is they want
to give each one of them

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15780-1
01:40:36.036 --> 01:40:38.164
depending on the weightage that
they give.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15793-0
01:40:38.374 --> 01:40:41.307
The distance computation will
change, Mr Virender Singh have

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15793-1
01:40:41.307 --> 01:40:42.364
answered the question.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15807-0
01:40:45.584 --> 01:40:48.094
And of course it can be any type
of distance.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15815-0
01:40:48.104 --> 01:40:50.144
It can be Manhattan distance,
Euclidean distance.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15852-0
01:40:50.154 --> 01:40:53.631
We are going to learn about
various types of distances that

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15852-1
01:40:53.631 --> 01:40:57.167
can be computed and, but then
the important part is that you

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15852-2
01:40:57.167 --> 01:41:00.933
need to identify which are most
significant attributes which are

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15852-3
01:41:00.933 --> 01:41:02.614
least significant attributes.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15860-0
01:41:02.714 --> 01:41:03.444
What is the type of?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15869-0
01:41:03.454 --> 01:41:04.614
The weight is that you want to
do.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15889-0
01:41:15.694 --> 01:41:19.952
So we are looking at the
association rules, so this is

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15889-1
01:41:19.952 --> 01:41:22.584
describing the association
rules.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15900-0
01:41:22.594 --> 01:41:24.784
I hope I do not need to explain.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15918-0
01:41:24.794 --> 01:41:29.747
These are all simple terms, so
when you have a rule, you have

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15918-1
01:41:29.747 --> 01:41:32.224
an antecedent and a consequent.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15924-0
01:41:40.804 --> 01:41:43.304
So this is the antecedent.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15930-0
01:41:46.424 --> 01:41:47.844
And this is consequent.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15958-0
01:41:49.854 --> 01:41:56.471
So nothing more and you may see
that there can be various

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15958-1
01:41:56.471 --> 01:42:01.034
applications for this type of
patterns.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15989-0
01:42:01.344 --> 01:42:05.155
So for example, if you're
talking about, let us say the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15989-1
01:42:05.155 --> 01:42:09.102
type of a problem and the type
of the components that are

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/15989-2
01:42:09.102 --> 01:42:09.714
required.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16023-0
01:42:10.044 --> 01:42:14.046
So you are sending a service van
to service the customers and

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16023-1
01:42:14.046 --> 01:42:17.982
then and then you do not have a
full idea about the problems

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16023-2
01:42:17.982 --> 01:42:19.144
that they have to.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16048-0
01:42:19.154 --> 01:42:23.557
For example, you are sending
some service person he has to go

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16048-1
01:42:23.557 --> 01:42:27.604
around and fix the problems with
the 10 television sets.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16051-0
01:42:28.234 --> 01:42:29.304
Order, order.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16056-0
01:42:29.314 --> 01:42:30.604
Maybe television sets?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16079-0
01:42:30.734 --> 01:42:36.071
I do not know whether people are
repairing now, but maybe we can

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16079-1
01:42:36.071 --> 01:42:38.534
talk about some other a thing.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16090-0
01:42:38.544 --> 01:42:41.694
Let's say air conditioners OK
and then air conditioners.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16130-0
01:42:41.744 --> 01:42:44.636
That person has to service the
10 air conditioners in the day

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16130-1
01:42:44.636 --> 01:42:47.156
and you think that there are
some components that are

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16130-2
01:42:47.156 --> 01:42:49.908
required and you also have some
idea about the type of the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16130-3
01:42:49.908 --> 01:42:51.494
problems that they have
reported.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16143-0
01:42:51.504 --> 01:42:53.434
They cannot give you exact
statement of the problem.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16148-0
01:42:53.444 --> 01:42:54.094
They do not know.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16167-0
01:42:54.564 --> 01:42:57.439
So based on that, you may be
able to decide what are the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16167-1
01:42:57.439 --> 01:43:00.264
components that the service
person should carry, right?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16189-0
01:43:03.004 --> 01:43:07.528
And then beyond the Market
Basket analysis, you may also

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16189-1
01:43:07.528 --> 01:43:10.544
find interesting sequential
patterns.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16209-0
01:43:11.004 --> 01:43:15.128
Sequential patterns are that
some event happened today, so

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16209-1
01:43:15.128 --> 01:43:17.994
another event is likely to
happen later.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16231-0
01:43:18.304 --> 01:43:23.530
So if you have bought a bike
motorbike cycle from a

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16231-1
01:43:23.530 --> 01:43:28.354
motorcycle from A1 of your
dealers in the city.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16268-0
01:43:28.804 --> 01:43:35.448
So if you bought that motorcycle
motorcycle on 25th of November,

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16268-1
01:43:35.448 --> 01:43:41.886
they know that you will require
one liter of engine oil in May

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16268-2
01:43:41.886 --> 01:43:42.704
of 2024.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16316-0
01:43:43.154 --> 01:43:47.354
So this is a sequential pattern,
so they you do not require

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16316-1
01:43:47.354 --> 01:43:51.764
engine oil today, but they know
that if they had sold thousand

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16316-2
01:43:51.764 --> 01:43:55.894
motorcycles today in me, they
know for sure that they will

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16316-3
01:43:55.894 --> 01:43:58.344
require 1000 liters of engine
oil.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16361-0
01:43:58.794 --> 01:44:02.430
So this is representing a
sequential pattern, so

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16361-1
01:44:02.430 --> 01:44:07.104
sequential pattern can have the
elements such as the gap, then

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16361-2
01:44:07.104 --> 01:44:11.555
Windows sites that span and they
can be many problems, many

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16361-3
01:44:11.555 --> 01:44:15.784
situations where the sequential
pattern will be helpful.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16370-0
01:44:17.584 --> 01:44:19.904
So each example has its own
domain meaning.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16385-0
01:44:27.864 --> 01:44:31.834
And we may have a problem such
as prediction.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16416-0
01:44:32.204 --> 01:44:37.135
So prediction is about trying to
predict the value of something

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16416-1
01:44:37.135 --> 01:44:41.834
based on some inputs that you
have instead of a class label,

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16416-2
01:44:41.834 --> 01:44:43.914
we are predicting the host.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16430-0
01:44:44.124 --> 01:44:50.760
So the very popular always
people quote is that I have in

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16430-1
01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:51.904
apartment.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16467-0
01:44:56.484 --> 01:45:02.552
So so now I have see I have
locality idea, so the locality

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16467-1
01:45:02.552 --> 01:45:09.032
I'm putting it as a high class
locality, middle class locality

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16467-2
01:45:09.032 --> 01:45:12.014
or a or some simple locality.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16475-0
01:45:12.264 --> 01:45:14.294
So maybe I'll put two
categories.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16492-0
01:45:14.304 --> 01:45:18.477
One is a high class and the
possibly one and then two and

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16492-1
01:45:18.477 --> 01:45:19.124
then one.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16529-0
01:45:19.264 --> 01:45:25.847
So the area is 1000 square foot
and then the price is 10 million

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16529-1
01:45:25.847 --> 01:45:30.404
and then locality 2 this is 900
square foot.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16548-0
01:45:30.924 --> 01:45:37.618
And then let me see 6 million
and then locality one, I'm

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16548-1
01:45:37.618 --> 01:45:44.195
talking about 800 square foot
and then the price is 7.5

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16548-2
01:45:44.195 --> 01:45:45.134
million.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16557-0
01:45:45.864 --> 01:45:48.514
So now I'm trying to predict.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16578-0
01:45:48.524 --> 01:45:54.576
I have got a I'm seeing a new
apartment in locality one with

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16578-1
01:45:54.576 --> 01:45:57.354
the area of 850 square foot.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16603-0
01:45:57.864 --> 01:46:01.980
So what should be the expected
price of that this problem is

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16603-1
01:46:01.980 --> 01:46:05.354
called as a problem of
prediction and regression.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16609-0
01:46:05.364 --> 01:46:07.414
Is the method of solving.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16622-0
01:46:07.504 --> 01:46:10.836
Typically the prediction you are
predicting a continuous valued

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16622-1
01:46:10.836 --> 01:46:11.304
variable.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16657-0
01:46:12.614 --> 01:46:16.864
OK, so this is similar to
classification where we were

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16657-1
01:46:16.864 --> 01:46:21.422
predicting a label, but now we
are predicting a continuous

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16657-2
01:46:21.422 --> 01:46:25.672
value and similarly we can have
a deviation or anomaly

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16657-3
01:46:25.672 --> 01:46:26.444
detection.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16664-0
01:46:26.454 --> 01:46:28.644
This is also called as outlier
analysis.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16710-0
01:46:31.984 --> 01:46:35.999
So what we are doing is that
there is a website that is

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16710-1
01:46:35.999 --> 01:46:40.157
serving a billion people and
there are few people who are

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16710-2
01:46:40.157 --> 01:46:44.315
somehow for some reason they
have got intention that they

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16710-3
01:46:44.315 --> 01:46:47.684
want to prevent that website
from functioning.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16727-0
01:46:48.354 --> 01:46:52.984
So they do some send some
messages using some lot of

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16727-1
01:46:52.984 --> 01:46:54.644
technical analysis.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16753-0
01:46:54.654 --> 01:46:57.969
They send some messages which
caused the server to be

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16753-1
01:46:57.969 --> 01:47:01.590
overloaded and thereby it is
unable to serve the remaining

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16753-2
01:47:01.590 --> 01:47:02.204
customers.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16780-0
01:47:02.314 --> 01:47:08.034
So recognizing such intrusions
is a anomaly detection, or out

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16780-1
01:47:08.034 --> 01:47:13.570
clear analysis, thereby lowing
such anomalies will help the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16780-2
01:47:13.570 --> 01:47:14.954
business a lot.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16787-0
01:47:16.864 --> 01:47:20.584
OK, now now I'm doing.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16800-0
01:47:25.014 --> 01:47:30.094
OK, I am enabling the mic for
people and I have.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16810-0
01:47:33.124 --> 01:47:35.084
OK, let me let me see.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16829-0
01:47:35.144 --> 01:47:39.859
There are questions from Mr
Aniruddha that athletic apparel

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16829-1
01:47:39.859 --> 01:47:44.024
example of sequential pattern
similar to market bus.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16840-0
01:47:44.034 --> 01:47:49.394
Yes, S association rules and
sequential patterns.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16843-0
01:47:49.674 --> 01:47:50.494
They are similar.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16862-0
01:47:50.684 --> 01:47:54.029
It is only that association
rules focus only on

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16862-1
01:47:54.029 --> 01:47:57.374
combinatorial elements and
sequential patterns.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16873-0
01:47:57.384 --> 01:48:00.454
Look at both combinatorial and
sequential elements.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16885-0
01:48:00.704 --> 01:48:04.253
So sequential pattern mining is
typically more complex than

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16885-1
01:48:04.253 --> 01:48:05.554
association with mine.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16892-0
01:48:08.934 --> 01:48:11.194
I hope the the answer is.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16902-0
01:48:13.034 --> 01:48:13.314
Clear.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16898-0
01:48:13.614 --> 01:48:14.184
Yes.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16900-0
01:48:14.434 --> 01:48:14.844
Yes, Sir.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16905-0
01:48:14.854 --> 01:48:15.144
Thank you.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16906-0
01:48:15.544 --> 01:48:16.134
OK, OK.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16918-0
01:48:19.634 --> 01:48:22.294
OK, so in that case I can
proceed to further.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16940-0
01:48:27.184 --> 01:48:29.124
So let us look, yes.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16935-0
01:48:27.534 --> 01:48:29.744
That can you sounds like.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16952-0
01:48:29.754 --> 01:48:32.409
Can it be like being that Market
Basket analysis that you were

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16952-1
01:48:32.409 --> 01:48:32.704
saying?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16966-0
01:48:34.324 --> 01:48:36.414
Mr Aditya, can you repeat the
question?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16985-0
01:48:37.044 --> 01:48:39.332
Can you please explain the
Market Basket and this is that

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16985-1
01:48:39.332 --> 01:48:39.924
you are saying?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17000-0
01:48:39.894 --> 01:48:43.469
Yes, yes, I can go back to that
slide and possibly spend few

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17000-1
01:48:43.469 --> 01:48:44.524
more minutes. Yes.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16996-0
01:48:44.584 --> 01:48:44.854
Yeah.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/16998-0
01:48:44.864 --> 01:48:45.094
Please.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17001-0
01:48:45.104 --> 01:48:45.404
Thank you.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17025-0
01:48:53.474 --> 01:48:58.190
So now we are talking about the
transactions that have happened

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17025-1
01:48:58.190 --> 01:49:01.064
in a grocery store or say
supermarket.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17044-0
01:49:01.554 --> 01:49:05.275
So what we are saying is that a
customer walks in transaction ID

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17044-1
01:49:05.275 --> 01:49:05.504
one.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17049-0
01:49:05.594 --> 01:49:07.484
The person buys these two items.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17085-0
01:49:07.554 --> 01:49:11.206
You can see that the person
transaction one, there are two

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17085-1
01:49:11.206 --> 01:49:14.982
items that they bought and then
in transaction 2 that person

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17085-2
01:49:14.982 --> 01:49:18.324
bought 4 items, transaction 3
and so on and so forth.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17112-0
01:49:18.554 --> 01:49:22.849
So based on this data, they can
formulate association rules

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17112-1
01:49:22.849 --> 01:49:27.287
saying that the person who is
buying diaper is very likely to

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17112-2
01:49:27.287 --> 01:49:28.074
buy butter.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17140-0
01:49:28.144 --> 01:49:31.592
So don't, don't try to find out
the logical reasoning or

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17140-1
01:49:31.592 --> 01:49:35.403
connection between the items or
this is possibly something you

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17140-2
01:49:35.403 --> 01:49:36.734
can understand easily.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17178-0
01:49:37.164 --> 01:49:41.042
The person who is buying bread
is also buying the button, so by

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17178-1
01:49:41.042 --> 01:49:44.798
formulating this type of rules
and then of course we need the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17178-2
01:49:44.798 --> 01:49:48.554
metrics to find out which rule
is good, which rule is strong?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17184-0
01:49:48.564 --> 01:49:49.594
Which rule is weak?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17189-0
01:49:49.664 --> 01:49:50.354
And so on.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17193-0
01:49:50.444 --> 01:49:51.714
And which rule is valuable?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17200-0
01:49:51.724 --> 01:49:52.774
Which rule is interesting?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17237-0
01:49:52.824 --> 01:49:57.442
We we want to find all those
things that we look at later on,

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17237-1
01:49:57.442 --> 01:50:01.912
but finding these rules is
giving insights that are helpful

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17237-2
01:50:01.912 --> 01:50:04.444
for the owner of the
supermarket.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17247-0
01:50:05.164 --> 01:50:08.104
Does that answer your question
or clarify the association rule?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17249-0
01:50:09.654 --> 01:50:10.044
Yeah.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17258-0
01:50:10.094 --> 01:50:12.804
So we are not building any
algorithm here.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17275-0
01:50:12.814 --> 01:50:13.754
We are framing rules.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17270-0
01:50:13.414 --> 01:50:14.944
No, no, we didn't use an
algorithm.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17288-0
01:50:14.954 --> 01:50:17.118
We will use an algorithm, but we
are not discussing the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17288-1
01:50:17.118 --> 01:50:17.504
algorithm.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17298-0
01:50:17.514 --> 01:50:19.944
Now we are only telling what is
association.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17294-0
01:50:17.824 --> 01:50:18.164
OK.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17320-0
01:50:20.834 --> 01:50:23.944
So the example you are giving
for Market Basket analysis does

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17320-1
01:50:23.944 --> 01:50:27.103
not comes under the prediction
regression because you predict,

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17320-2
01:50:27.103 --> 01:50:27.404
right?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17338-0
01:50:27.414 --> 01:50:29.164
So if you buy this product.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17360-0
01:50:28.134 --> 01:50:32.500
No, no, it we don't call that
prediction because what what is

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17360-1
01:50:32.500 --> 01:50:36.937
happening is that we are finding
association between the items

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17360-2
01:50:36.937 --> 01:50:38.204
based on the data.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17366-0
01:50:38.214 --> 01:50:39.684
There is no supervision. Here.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17399-0
01:50:40.114 --> 01:50:43.711
We are taking the data as it is
and we are discovering the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17399-1
01:50:43.711 --> 01:50:47.674
associations Mr Karthikeyan, so
that is why it is not considered

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17399-2
01:50:47.674 --> 01:50:49.564
supervised machine learning so.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17405-0
01:50:48.844 --> 01:50:49.104
OK.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17418-0
01:50:49.614 --> 01:50:53.144
So you may say that, OK, it is
helping you in something so.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17429-0
01:50:53.494 --> 01:50:56.064
It it may help you in doing
something.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17461-0
01:50:56.074 --> 01:50:59.453
For example, bread implies
butter, so it may mean that if

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17461-1
01:50:59.453 --> 01:51:03.066
butter is running out, you may
know that the customers buying

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17461-2
01:51:03.066 --> 01:51:04.464
bread will be suffering.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17499-0
01:51:04.524 --> 01:51:08.246
So maybe it is helping you some
way, but we don't call that

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17499-1
01:51:08.246 --> 01:51:11.844
supervised machine learning for
whatever reasons is that.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17512-0
01:51:11.364 --> 01:51:14.742
So in this case, in this case
our algorithm will will just

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17512-1
01:51:14.742 --> 01:51:15.944
learn from the rules.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17514-0
01:51:16.764 --> 01:51:17.654
Yeah, that is right.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17527-0
01:51:17.704 --> 01:51:21.364
Just learn from transactions
without looking for any label.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17530-0
01:51:23.224 --> 01:51:23.574
Understood.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17544-0
01:51:32.724 --> 01:51:36.034
OK, Mr Gaurav is asking what is
regression model?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17559-0
01:51:36.094 --> 01:51:40.352
See regression model is there to
solve the problem of prediction

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17559-1
01:51:40.352 --> 01:51:41.334
the prediction.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17564-0
01:51:41.344 --> 01:51:42.394
I hope you understood.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17597-0
01:51:42.404 --> 01:51:45.612
I have taken the example of
predicting the price of an

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17597-1
01:51:45.612 --> 01:51:49.286
apartment, so let us say there
are only two attributes, one is

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17597-2
01:51:49.286 --> 01:51:51.094
locality and the other is area.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17613-0
01:51:51.404 --> 01:51:54.514
We are trying to predict based
on the data that we have.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17617-0
01:51:54.564 --> 01:51:55.854
Mr Gaurav, is that clear?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17626-0
01:51:56.124 --> 01:51:58.144
Regression is a model that we
study later.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17632-0
01:51:59.254 --> 01:52:00.424
Prediction is the problem.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17639-0
01:52:00.434 --> 01:52:02.174
I hope that is OK.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17656-0
01:52:14.654 --> 01:52:19.264
OK, so now we will spend few
minutes on data science process.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17687-0
01:52:20.034 --> 01:52:23.812
So we are we are we have only 10
minutes so but fine we will

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17687-1
01:52:23.812 --> 01:52:27.404
spend as much and then we will
continue in the next class

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17687-2
01:52:27.404 --> 01:52:28.704
whatever overflow is.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17718-0
01:52:34.984 --> 01:52:40.516
So data science is really,
really significantly had a

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17718-1
01:52:40.516 --> 01:52:47.073
cousin in software development
in the sense that ultimately you

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17718-2
01:52:47.073 --> 01:52:49.634
have to develop software.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17735-0
01:52:49.944 --> 01:52:52.972
When you say machine is
learning, let us not forget that

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17735-1
01:52:52.972 --> 01:52:54.884
the programs are written by
humans.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17761-0
01:52:55.814 --> 01:53:00.228
So machine is supporting by
studying the data and is helping

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17761-1
01:53:00.228 --> 01:53:04.424
you giving the hints with
respect to the decision making.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17789-0
01:53:04.854 --> 01:53:09.959
But then the programs are still
written by the machine and the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17789-1
01:53:09.959 --> 01:53:14.496
bare metal machine is actually
is a brute waiting to be

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17789-2
01:53:14.496 --> 01:53:15.144
trained.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17822-0
01:53:15.414 --> 01:53:18.914
So so we have lot of software
running on the machine and the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17822-1
01:53:18.914 --> 01:53:22.643
software either you wrote, wrote
or somebody else wrote but then

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17822-2
01:53:22.643 --> 01:53:25.224
it is it is a software that is
facilitating.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17844-0
01:53:25.234 --> 01:53:29.880
So in that sense, the data
science also has to take some

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17844-1
01:53:29.880 --> 01:53:34.934
inspiration or some learning
from these software engineering.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17861-0
01:53:37.264 --> 01:53:41.796
So in software engineering, we
can have the process models for

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17861-1
01:53:41.796 --> 01:53:43.234
developing software.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17865-0
01:53:43.484 --> 01:53:43.854
OK.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17875-0
01:53:43.864 --> 01:53:46.414
So we are talking about some
examples of process models.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17896-0
01:53:46.764 --> 01:53:50.588
So one is waterfall model, one
is iterative model and other is

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17896-1
01:53:50.588 --> 01:53:52.834
agile model for developing
software.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17912-0
01:53:53.304 --> 01:53:58.674
I hope you people are clear, but
then the idea is that so.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17921-0
01:53:58.744 --> 01:54:02.954
So the idea is that this is this
is helpful.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17926-0
01:54:05.294 --> 01:54:07.874
Helpful for complex problems.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17931-0
01:54:11.414 --> 01:54:13.084
With longer cycles.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17942-0
01:54:16.674 --> 01:54:23.474
And this is this is helpful for
a rapid development.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17992-0
01:54:25.184 --> 01:54:28.757
So the problem may be complex,
but what you did is that you

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17992-1
01:54:28.757 --> 01:54:32.092
started breaking down the
problem and you also realized

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17992-2
01:54:32.092 --> 01:54:35.665
that incremental gains can
happen if you start implementing

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17992-3
01:54:35.665 --> 01:54:39.178
small part of the problem and
step by step you enhance the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/17992-4
01:54:39.178 --> 01:54:39.714
solution.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18005-0
01:54:39.944 --> 01:54:42.414
So then you will go for a more
of an asylum.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18029-0
01:54:43.854 --> 01:54:48.644
So the data science process also
has many of the things which

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18029-1
01:54:48.644 --> 01:54:52.662
required, for example,
understanding the problem in

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18029-2
01:54:52.662 --> 01:54:54.284
software engineering.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18031-0
01:54:54.854 --> 01:54:56.354
It is called analysis.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18049-0
01:54:58.894 --> 01:55:04.249
Developing the model, this can
be coming under, so possibly

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18049-1
01:55:04.249 --> 01:55:07.284
what you may say is
construction.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18094-0
01:55:09.174 --> 01:55:13.410
Or you may call with multiple
names, such as architecting,

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18094-1
01:55:13.410 --> 01:55:18.005
designing, coding, and there can
be so there can be many phases

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18094-2
01:55:18.005 --> 01:55:22.384
and then applying the model on
data set to see how it works.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18098-0
01:55:22.834 --> 01:55:24.484
This is often testing.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18101-0
01:55:26.344 --> 01:55:26.734
Alright.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18114-0
01:55:27.024 --> 01:55:30.014
And then deployment as it is
like in software engineering.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18155-0
01:55:30.304 --> 01:55:34.237
So there are data science
processes which have got lot of

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18155-1
01:55:34.237 --> 01:55:38.712
similarities, but there are also
differences because data science

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18155-2
01:55:38.712 --> 01:55:42.984
process as we see that involves
lot of getting the data right.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18167-0
01:55:43.844 --> 01:55:46.954
So that is very important part
of the data science process.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18212-0
01:55:47.244 --> 01:55:51.950
So in that for that region he
the many people from many

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18212-1
01:55:51.950 --> 01:55:57.077
industries have come together
and developed a process called

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18212-2
01:55:57.077 --> 01:56:02.119
crisp DM, which is helpful in
building the systems that are

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18212-3
01:56:02.119 --> 01:56:05.144
essentially data science
solutions.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18225-0
01:56:05.844 --> 01:56:08.524
So here we need to understand
the business.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18258-0
01:56:09.114 --> 01:56:13.924
We need to understand the data
and we need to prepare the data

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18258-1
01:56:13.924 --> 01:56:18.582
and then we need to model and
then after we do the model, we

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18258-2
01:56:18.582 --> 01:56:20.414
evaluate and we go back.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18261-0
01:56:20.454 --> 01:56:21.644
Essentially we are iterating.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18283-0
01:56:23.824 --> 01:56:27.893
OK, so we are iterating these
steps and at some point we are

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18283-1
01:56:27.893 --> 01:56:30.294
satisfied and we do the
deployment.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18285-0
01:56:30.984 --> 01:56:31.694
So.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18322-0
01:56:31.764 --> 01:56:36.765
So what we see is that if you
want to elaborate further, each

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18322-1
01:56:36.765 --> 01:56:41.605
one of these phases, so you see
that Chris has six distinct

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18322-2
01:56:41.605 --> 01:56:45.234
phases and each phase has got
several tasks.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18329-0
01:56:45.704 --> 01:56:48.314
So I think the tasks are mostly
self explanatory.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18357-0
01:56:50.134 --> 01:56:56.105
So you can see that the first
phase which is with respect to

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18357-1
01:56:56.105 --> 01:57:01.684
which is with respect to the the
business understanding.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18410-0
01:57:01.774 --> 01:57:06.569
So it is pretty much like we are
trying to do what many times

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18410-1
01:57:06.569 --> 01:57:10.977
people do as a SRS software
requirement specification or

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18410-2
01:57:10.977 --> 01:57:15.772
business analyst is going and
talking to the to the users and

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18410-3
01:57:15.772 --> 01:57:20.335
is creating the stories so that
you start implementing the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18410-4
01:57:20.335 --> 01:57:20.954
stories.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18470-0
01:57:21.384 --> 01:57:25.140
So the point is that many of
that similar things you need to

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18470-1
01:57:25.140 --> 01:57:28.711
do, but then your focus is
different, that is you go, you

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18470-2
01:57:28.711 --> 01:57:32.714
have a lot of data and you want
to gather insights, but then the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18470-3
01:57:32.714 --> 01:57:36.223
insights are valuable only if
you understand what is the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18470-4
01:57:36.223 --> 01:57:38.994
business, what is valuable for
the business.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18489-0
01:57:42.554 --> 01:57:47.321
And then did not many steps that
you need to perform with respect

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18489-1
01:57:47.321 --> 01:57:49.054
to the data preparation.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18508-0
01:57:52.084 --> 01:57:57.221
So that involves the
understanding that data quality

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18508-1
01:57:57.221 --> 01:57:59.934
and then preparing the data.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18530-0
01:58:00.264 --> 01:58:05.308
So these are many of these steps
are referred as a preprocessing

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18530-1
01:58:05.308 --> 01:58:07.714
in some terms, so I'm going to.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18539-0
01:58:09.094 --> 01:58:11.354
All I'm saying is that you, me
here.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18543-0
01:58:11.364 --> 01:58:12.594
Many words many times.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18561-0
01:58:12.604 --> 01:58:15.992
So somebody may say
preprocessing and some author

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18561-1
01:58:15.992 --> 01:58:19.244
may say that you are doing
feature engineering.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18584-0
01:58:22.484 --> 01:58:27.304
And some mortars may say that
you are doing ETL, you have to

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18584-1
01:58:27.304 --> 01:58:29.674
do before you build the model.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18614-0
01:58:30.084 --> 01:58:34.275
So so let us not be overwhelmed,
but we understand that there are

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18614-1
01:58:34.275 --> 01:58:37.894
several steps that need to be
performed before you start

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18614-2
01:58:37.894 --> 01:58:39.354
constructing the model.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18617-0
01:58:42.174 --> 01:58:42.434
Alright.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18634-0
01:58:43.234 --> 01:58:48.604
And that then once the model is
dead, we need to evaluate the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18634-1
01:58:48.604 --> 01:58:49.124
model.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18704-0
01:58:49.134 --> 01:58:53.315
How do we evaluate the model we
are going to run it on some new

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18704-1
01:58:53.315 --> 01:58:57.365
data for which we know what is
the expected output and we are

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18704-2
01:58:57.365 --> 01:59:01.154
going to see is it giving the
output as expected or is it

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18704-3
01:59:01.154 --> 01:59:05.205
giving distinctive and then we
want to go back and analyze if

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18704-4
01:59:05.205 --> 01:59:08.732
the model is something that
Gartner calls interesting

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18704-5
01:59:08.732 --> 01:59:12.064
expectation from today's system
is explainable AI.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18731-0
01:59:15.824 --> 01:59:19.641
So they're saying that the
deeper understanding you get

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18731-1
01:59:19.641 --> 01:59:23.663
from the of the model you you
have a greater confidence in

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18731-2
01:59:23.663 --> 01:59:24.004
them.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18740-0
01:59:27.714 --> 01:59:30.714
OK, I think I will not.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18793-0
01:59:30.774 --> 01:59:35.467
This is the so maybe I will take
a minute to go through this

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18793-1
01:59:35.467 --> 01:59:39.929
document which is the crisp
evaluation, which is a recent

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18793-2
01:59:39.929 --> 01:59:44.468
document which is done by the
data science process aliens,

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18793-3
01:59:44.468 --> 01:59:48.853
which says that presently about
half of the data science

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18793-4
01:59:48.853 --> 01:59:51.084
projects mostly go with this.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18806-0
01:59:51.254 --> 01:59:54.204
That is their survey that they
had done in 2020.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18808-0
01:59:54.504 --> 01:59:54.984
OK.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18821-0
01:59:55.174 --> 01:59:57.174
And then they explained the
same.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18840-0
01:59:57.684 --> 02:00:01.840
And they also talk about what
are the strengths and weaknesses

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18840-1
02:00:01.840 --> 02:00:05.204
within the crisp DM so that you
need to take care.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18848-0
02:00:10.384 --> 02:00:12.684
So I'm stopping at this point.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18866-0
02:00:12.764 --> 02:00:16.264
I'm just waiting if there are
any questions I will take,

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18866-1
02:00:16.264 --> 02:00:18.474
otherwise I will close the
session.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18870-0
02:00:18.864 --> 02:00:20.814
So ohh.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18888-0
02:00:24.064 --> 02:00:25.124
Thank you, Sir for the.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18883-0
02:00:24.254 --> 02:00:24.614
Book.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18885-0
02:00:24.254 --> 02:00:24.654
OK.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18895-0
02:00:26.074 --> 02:00:26.914
OK, what is?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18890-0
02:00:26.274 --> 02:00:26.554
Yeah.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18899-0
02:00:26.564 --> 02:00:27.414
So thank you, Sir.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18902-0
02:00:26.924 --> 02:00:29.274
Classification is supervised
machine learning.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18912-0
02:00:29.284 --> 02:00:32.070
Clustering is unsupervised
machine learning, so

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18912-1
02:00:32.070 --> 02:00:34.334
classification requires training
data.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18944-0
02:00:34.654 --> 02:00:38.726
Clustering is on the data, so it
is not having anything called

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18944-1
02:00:38.726 --> 02:00:42.474
training data have a answered or
am I confusing you more?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18962-0
02:00:45.024 --> 02:00:47.804
And I think the examples of the
problems are also given.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/18978-0
02:00:49.104 --> 02:00:54.214
Uh, OK, I will go back to maybe
the example will help you.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19025-0
02:00:54.664 --> 02:00:59.658
So classification example, each
checking which customer is

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19025-1
02:00:59.658 --> 02:01:04.736
likely to buy the product OK
classification example is that

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19003-0
02:01:04.144 --> 02:01:04.404
As.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19025-2
02:01:04.736 --> 02:01:10.153
you have a product and you want
to know which customer will buy

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19025-3
02:01:10.153 --> 02:01:13.284
and clustering is that you have
got.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19033-0
02:01:13.734 --> 02:01:16.224
You have got many.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19064-0
02:01:16.294 --> 02:01:21.326
You have got many people and
then you want to group them into

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19064-1
02:01:21.326 --> 02:01:25.951
separate categories so that it
may help you in doing the

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19064-2
02:01:25.951 --> 02:01:27.574
business operations.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19073-0
02:01:29.264 --> 02:01:30.504
You do not have anything else.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19080-0
02:01:33.434 --> 02:01:33.644
Uh.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19093-0
02:01:33.654 --> 02:01:36.664
Having answered summer Karthik,
you can speak actually.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19128-0
02:01:40.104 --> 02:01:45.327
I'm really jumping the gun, but
a new validate a clustering

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19105-0
02:01:40.394 --> 02:01:40.654
Got.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19128-1
02:01:45.327 --> 02:01:46.894
algorithms output.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19129-0
02:01:47.304 --> 02:01:48.634
Yes, yes, we will study that.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19144-0
02:01:48.644 --> 02:01:52.054
It is not easy, but then we will
study that we will study few

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19144-1
02:01:52.054 --> 02:01:52.494
methods.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19153-0
02:01:54.674 --> 02:01:56.514
That we will study little later.
OK?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19160-0
02:01:58.184 --> 02:01:59.524
OK, Mr Raja.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19171-0
02:01:59.534 --> 02:02:02.504
Anti Lal is asking what will be
the exam like.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19192-0
02:02:04.084 --> 02:02:08.266
See the exam will be something
which is, uh, which will have if

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19192-1
02:02:08.266 --> 02:02:08.854
you want.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19203-0
02:02:08.864 --> 02:02:13.524
If I put it in simple check the
concepts and the apply.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19214-0
02:02:15.274 --> 02:02:17.454
So both of them we will check.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19226-0
02:02:17.724 --> 02:02:19.684
So you may have to solve some
numericals.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19242-0
02:02:19.694 --> 02:02:23.379
You may have to explain certain
concepts, but then we will talk

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19242-1
02:02:23.379 --> 02:02:24.934
a little about examination.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19257-0
02:02:24.944 --> 02:02:27.987
But then the course is not
really only for examination

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19257-1
02:02:27.987 --> 02:02:28.374
anyway.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19271-0
02:02:28.884 --> 02:02:31.594
If anyway, you will prepare for
the examination, no problem.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19281-0
02:02:31.644 --> 02:02:35.644
But the we have to facilitate
the learning first, right?

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19304-0
02:02:38.244 --> 02:02:42.059
OK, Mr SAURABH Gautam is asking
upload the document, yes, yes,

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19304-1
02:02:42.059 --> 02:02:43.754
the slides will be uploaded.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19316-0
02:02:43.764 --> 02:02:46.134
Yes, and the anyway this session
is getting recorded.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19328-0
02:02:48.784 --> 02:02:49.934
Alright, OK.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19340-0
02:02:50.004 --> 02:02:52.434
If there are no other questions,
we will close the session.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19352-0
02:03:01.664 --> 02:03:02.644
Thank you, Mr crap.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19357-0
02:03:04.064 --> 02:03:04.994
Thank you, Sir. Bye.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19358-0
02:03:05.914 --> 02:03:06.084
Yeah.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19361-0
02:03:05.954 --> 02:03:06.214
Cancel.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19366-0
02:03:06.854 --> 02:03:07.344
Thank you, Sir.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19367-0
02:03:08.604 --> 02:03:09.024
Thank you, Sir.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19378-0
02:03:13.484 --> 02:03:13.904
Thank you.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19379-0
02:03:13.544 --> 02:03:13.954
Thank you, Sir.

6c77ddf5-1d9f-435b-aa6b-ab46079d0285/19380-0
