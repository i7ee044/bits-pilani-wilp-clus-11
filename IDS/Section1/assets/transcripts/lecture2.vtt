7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/170-0
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:13.553
So, good evening.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/183-0
00:00:14.493 --> 00:00:17.423
We will be continuing our
discussion from the last

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/183-1
00:00:17.423 --> 00:00:17.883
session.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/212-0
00:00:17.893 --> 00:00:22.147
Last session was a more of an
overview session about what we

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/212-1
00:00:22.147 --> 00:00:25.703
are going to discuss in the
subject and and so on.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/249-0
00:00:25.753 --> 00:00:29.351
So giving a very brief overview
and also we had a brief

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/249-1
00:00:29.351 --> 00:00:32.885
discussion on the data types of
data that exist in the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/249-2
00:00:32.885 --> 00:00:35.263
organizations, how they are
related.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/303-0
00:00:35.313 --> 00:00:38.750
If we look at one specific
vendors architecture for

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/303-1
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.583
enterprise data and I hope
things are clear, I have heard

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/303-2
00:00:42.583 --> 00:00:46.615
already from a couple of like
zipping's that they won't some

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/303-3
00:00:46.615 --> 00:00:50.382
of those concepts are to be
reviewed and I'm going to do

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/303-4
00:00:50.382 --> 00:00:50.713
that.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/321-0
00:00:50.783 --> 00:00:55.482
That will be the first thing I
will do, so I think it is Miss

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/321-1
00:00:55.482 --> 00:00:56.013
Rashmi.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/333-0
00:00:56.023 --> 00:00:58.833
Bala is 1 and other thing I'm
not sure.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/341-0
00:00:58.843 --> 00:01:00.133
I think it is Mr Ranganathan.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/364-0
00:01:00.143 --> 00:01:04.462
So what I'll do is, so I'm going
into the slide deck for the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/364-1
00:01:04.462 --> 00:01:05.453
first session.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/404-0
00:01:05.463 --> 00:01:09.725
We have not completed the deck,
so we will anyway spend some

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/404-1
00:01:09.725 --> 00:01:13.709
more time and I'm going into
first the concept of Market

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/404-2
00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:16.993
Basket analysis that but that
you brought out.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/424-0
00:01:17.893 --> 00:01:23.558
So the Market Basket analysis,
uh, OK, this is the this is also

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/424-1
00:01:23.558 --> 00:01:27.896
called association rule
discovery or association

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/424-2
00:01:27.896 --> 00:01:28.693
analysis.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/434-0
00:01:28.753 --> 00:01:31.323
People use many terms, so let's
not worry.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/460-0
00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:34.687
But then we'll see what is the
type of analysis that we do and

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/460-1
00:01:34.687 --> 00:01:37.403
what is the type of pattern that
we will discover.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/470-0
00:01:37.773 --> 00:01:41.293
So Miss Rashmi balance, so we
can talk, right?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/477-0
00:01:43.383 --> 00:01:44.153
We can talk.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/512-0
00:01:44.343 --> 00:01:49.161
I hope you will be talking and I
I can clarify, possibly because

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/492-0
00:01:45.343 --> 00:01:46.923
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/512-1
00:01:49.161 --> 00:01:53.830
just for the benefit of time, I
want to stick to a what is the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/512-2
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:54.423
concern?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/528-0
00:01:54.643 --> 00:01:58.123
And then so I'm I think I'm at
the right slide, right?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/531-0
00:01:59.453 --> 00:01:59.613
Yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/532-0
00:02:00.763 --> 00:02:01.133
Yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/544-0
00:02:01.283 --> 00:02:04.813
So here we are talking about
typical transactions.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/592-0
00:02:04.823 --> 00:02:07.786
We will just take the example
with the Market Basket only, but

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/592-1
00:02:07.786 --> 00:02:10.796
though this approach can be used
to solve many problems that we

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/592-2
00:02:10.796 --> 00:02:13.806
will see because in fact we will
spend considerable time on the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/592-3
00:02:13.806 --> 00:02:15.593
association rules after mid
semester.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/611-0
00:02:16.333 --> 00:02:20.818
So The thing is that association
is if we take a quick Market

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/599-0
00:02:16.473 --> 00:02:16.813
OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/611-1
00:02:20.818 --> 00:02:21.903
Basket example.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/636-0
00:02:22.213 --> 00:02:26.968
So what we are seeing is that in
in a store, many customers are

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/636-1
00:02:26.968 --> 00:02:29.643
walking in and taking something
in.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/656-0
00:02:29.653 --> 00:02:33.150
They're getting something in
their basket and walking out

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/656-1
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.803
with by making the payment and
walking out.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/676-0
00:02:36.273 --> 00:02:40.276
So we have observed for one
store the five customers who

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/676-1
00:02:40.276 --> 00:02:42.383
have done who have worked out.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/707-0
00:02:42.773 --> 00:02:46.734
So customer one had two items in
the basket, customer four had

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/707-1
00:02:46.734 --> 00:02:50.192
four items in the basket,
customer again customer five

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/707-2
00:02:50.192 --> 00:02:52.393
also has four items in the
basket.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/745-0
00:02:53.313 --> 00:02:58.476
So based on what they have, we
can always think in terms of is

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/745-1
00:02:58.476 --> 00:03:03.230
it possible that if a person
buys butter and bread, is it

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/745-2
00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.263
likely that the person can buy
milk?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/801-0
00:03:06.353 --> 00:03:10.230
So so the question is that to
being, of course this is a rule

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/801-1
00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.169
stated in the form of just a in
with the list of items, but we

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/801-2
00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:18.046
need certain measures associated
with the rule to say whether

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/801-3
00:03:18.046 --> 00:03:20.923
some rule is more interesting
than the other.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/810-0
00:03:21.473 --> 00:03:23.973
A Miss Rashmi Bala, are we clear
with the association rules?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/816-0
00:03:25.633 --> 00:03:26.283
Uh, you said.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/822-0
00:03:26.293 --> 00:03:26.723
Got it.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/834-0
00:03:26.733 --> 00:03:30.143
Suppose uh, instead of bread.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/842-0
00:03:30.153 --> 00:03:30.523
Uh.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/859-0
00:03:30.533 --> 00:03:34.716
Suppose someone buys some
different item, so that will be

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/851-0
00:03:33.353 --> 00:03:33.503
Yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/859-1
00:03:34.716 --> 00:03:36.303
belongs to the market.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/878-0
00:03:36.313 --> 00:03:40.668
Backer supposed to have four
members, so the one person is by

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/878-1
00:03:40.668 --> 00:03:42.213
bread, milk and other.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/897-0
00:03:42.223 --> 00:03:47.141
There's some vegetables, so they
didn't buy the bread and milk or

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/897-1
00:03:47.141 --> 00:03:48.483
any dairy product.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/917-0
00:03:49.193 --> 00:03:53.452
So that is that like the rule
follow or like it will be

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/917-1
00:03:53.452 --> 00:03:54.213
different.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/915-0
00:03:54.723 --> 00:03:55.613
OK, OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/936-0
00:03:55.663 --> 00:04:00.246
So what you are asking is
suppose that there is a family

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/936-1
00:04:00.246 --> 00:04:01.533
of four members.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/946-0
00:04:01.913 --> 00:04:05.665
So one member bought something
and another member bought

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/946-1
00:04:05.665 --> 00:04:06.653
something else.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/952-0
00:04:06.853 --> 00:04:07.953
Do we combine that?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/956-0
00:04:07.963 --> 00:04:08.633
Is that the question?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/958-0
00:04:09.193 --> 00:04:09.333
Yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/962-0
00:04:10.573 --> 00:04:11.203
OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/968-0
00:04:11.273 --> 00:04:12.763
Certainly it is possible.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/992-0
00:04:12.873 --> 00:04:17.013
It is always possible that we
can include because this is,

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/992-1
00:04:17.013 --> 00:04:20.733
after all, a data scientist can
decide how to do it.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/996-0
00:04:21.213 --> 00:04:22.633
So can include.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1058-0
00:04:23.803 --> 00:04:28.519
See ID and the CID will be for
let's say for the transaction

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1058-1
00:04:28.519 --> 00:04:33.544
one it is 1 transaction 2 it is
2, transaction 3 it is again one

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1058-2
00:04:33.544 --> 00:04:38.414
because the same customer ID the
person with the same frequent

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1058-3
00:04:38.414 --> 00:04:43.130
buyer card comes back and then
this is 4 and then let us say

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1058-4
00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.903
this is 2.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1079-0
00:04:45.353 --> 00:04:48.765
So we are going to reduce this
into two groups of items or

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1079-1
00:04:48.765 --> 00:04:50.443
sorry, three groups of items.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1097-0
00:04:50.493 --> 00:04:53.814
One is representing customer one
and another representing

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1097-1
00:04:53.814 --> 00:04:56.963
customer two, another
representing customer 4 Mr Bala.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1103-0
00:04:56.973 --> 00:04:57.943
Does that answer your question?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1109-0
00:04:59.463 --> 00:05:00.323
Uh, yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1119-0
00:05:00.623 --> 00:05:02.413
So actually I need one favor.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1148-0
00:05:02.423 --> 00:05:06.016
Whatever the explaining in the
slide, if that will be uploaded

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1148-1
00:05:06.016 --> 00:05:08.753
uploading canvas then that will
be easy for us.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1162-0
00:05:08.763 --> 00:05:12.263
Like we'll remember those
things.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1154-0
00:05:11.543 --> 00:05:12.613
See see.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1166-0
00:05:12.923 --> 00:05:14.313
See Mr ASMI Bala.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1208-0
00:05:14.593 --> 00:05:18.540
I'll tell you one thing, when we
when the session is but right

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1208-1
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.300
now the session is getting
recorded and also the transcript

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1208-2
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.310
is being created and sometimes
the transcript sounds very funny

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1208-3
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.253
because it distorts it doesn't.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1223-0
00:05:28.303 --> 00:05:31.516
It doesn't make very good
recognition of speech, but many

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1223-1
00:05:31.516 --> 00:05:32.513
things it catches.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1255-0
00:05:32.523 --> 00:05:36.573
So in spite of its mistakes, you
should still be able to capture

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1255-1
00:05:36.573 --> 00:05:40.435
our discussion, so that is all
there for you to watch at your

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1255-2
00:05:40.435 --> 00:05:41.183
convenience.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1263-0
00:05:41.953 --> 00:05:44.343
And now what exactly are you
looking for?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1269-0
00:05:44.613 --> 00:05:45.533
What more do you want?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1278-0
00:05:47.223 --> 00:05:48.593
Come and take the slide.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1326-0
00:05:48.603 --> 00:05:52.285
So it is like instead of
watching the video of suppose

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1326-1
00:05:52.285 --> 00:05:56.368
after watching the videos, if
we'll go through the document,

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1326-2
00:05:56.368 --> 00:06:00.451
whatever you say it if that is
like the some example will be

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1326-3
00:06:00.451 --> 00:06:00.853
there.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1344-0
00:06:00.863 --> 00:06:04.283
So it will like it will be more
clarified the concept and will

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1344-1
00:06:04.283 --> 00:06:05.043
be more clear.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1362-0
00:06:06.023 --> 00:06:08.694
OK, Miss Rashmi, Bella, you are
saying the slide deck is the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1362-1
00:06:08.694 --> 00:06:10.183
slide deck going to be
available?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1404-0
00:06:12.333 --> 00:06:15.675
Yes, whatever you are explaining
in the slide, if that concept

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1404-1
00:06:15.675 --> 00:06:18.593
will be there in the slide,
whatever uploading canvas.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1431-0
00:06:18.393 --> 00:06:21.135
You know, so, so, so you are
saying are you looking for

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1410-0
00:06:19.593 --> 00:06:19.763
Hey.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1431-1
00:06:21.135 --> 00:06:24.073
slight deck or you're looking
for the annotated slide deck?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1446-0
00:06:24.783 --> 00:06:27.183
But yeah, whatever you are
explaining in the class.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1484-0
00:06:28.333 --> 00:06:30.543
I never did a slide deck and it
did it.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1462-0
00:06:28.433 --> 00:06:29.923
No, no, no, no.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1464-0
00:06:28.943 --> 00:06:29.193
With the.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1466-0
00:06:29.733 --> 00:06:30.513
I thought.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1485-0
00:06:29.933 --> 00:06:31.943
Please, I guess, he says
annotated.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1493-0
00:06:30.243 --> 00:06:32.173
So she wants and united.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1468-0
00:06:30.593 --> 00:06:30.683
It.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1489-0
00:06:30.893 --> 00:06:31.543
He means another.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1511-0
00:06:32.653 --> 00:06:35.643
Yeah, she wants senator that.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1499-0
00:06:33.273 --> 00:06:35.013
OK, she's looking for
annotations.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1518-0
00:06:35.073 --> 00:06:38.064
So you already looked at the
slide deck for slide deck one,

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1518-1
00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:38.363
right?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1527-0
00:06:38.373 --> 00:06:39.823
You already got the first slide
deck.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1547-0
00:06:39.833 --> 00:06:43.233
It is already posted in canvas
and you looked at it so.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1554-0
00:06:42.923 --> 00:06:43.533
Right. So.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1549-0
00:06:43.293 --> 00:06:44.703
No, when no.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1571-0
00:06:44.713 --> 00:06:47.990
Whatever the examples you are
explaining in the class that

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1571-1
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.323
examples are not available on
that slide.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1594-0
00:06:50.333 --> 00:06:53.827
So if that will be there, then
it will be easier for us to

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1591-0
00:06:52.743 --> 00:06:54.323
I don't know which which is.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1594-1
00:06:53.827 --> 00:06:54.183
catch.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1618-0
00:06:54.373 --> 00:06:58.359
Is it certainly certainly that
example if it is not covered in

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1618-1
00:06:58.359 --> 00:07:01.333
the slide, maybe that would have
that is some.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1624-0
00:07:01.863 --> 00:07:03.973
Is there something that you
remember?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1645-0
00:07:04.023 --> 00:07:07.765
Because this is, this is pretty
much what I have put is

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1645-1
00:07:07.765 --> 00:07:11.173
sufficient concept to understand
association rule.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1673-0
00:07:11.783 --> 00:07:14.928
So if really it is the
annotations you're considering

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1673-1
00:07:14.928 --> 00:07:18.772
because the annotations increase
significantly the size, but then

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1673-2
00:07:18.772 --> 00:07:19.413
yeah, fine.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1684-0
00:07:19.423 --> 00:07:21.513
If you are really looking for
annotations, yeah, fine.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1702-0
00:07:22.043 --> 00:07:25.101
We can make dinner, take a
slightly cable, but I I don't

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1702-1
00:07:25.101 --> 00:07:26.013
know what is the.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1721-0
00:07:26.023 --> 00:07:28.533
What is that example that we
missed out?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1752-0
00:07:28.213 --> 00:07:32.076
But the the the banking example,
whatever they explained earlier

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1752-1
00:07:32.076 --> 00:07:34.573
in the first class that is not
available.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1738-0
00:07:33.693 --> 00:07:33.973
Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1749-0
00:07:33.983 --> 00:07:35.343
Yeah, but then the yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1775-0
00:07:35.353 --> 00:07:38.729
So if something of that is
missed out, you can always go to

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1775-1
00:07:38.729 --> 00:07:42.105
the video recording and look at
the exact 2 minutes of that

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1775-2
00:07:42.105 --> 00:07:42.443
video.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1777-0
00:07:42.453 --> 00:07:42.823
What?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1785-0
00:07:43.013 --> 00:07:44.303
What was discussed right?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1811-0
00:07:44.613 --> 00:07:47.808
I do not think that the slide
doesn't permit me to write too

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1811-1
00:07:47.808 --> 00:07:49.903
much, so I'll write only limited
thing.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1857-0
00:07:50.033 --> 00:07:53.089
In any case, in the example
banking example, so yeah, there

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1857-1
00:07:53.089 --> 00:07:56.197
is nothing to write, so I was
only telling that in bank they

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1857-2
00:07:56.197 --> 00:07:59.559
can always Group their customers
in some way or Group the product

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1857-3
00:07:59.559 --> 00:08:00.323
in second week.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1869-0
00:08:00.373 --> 00:08:02.013
Possibly that kind of example,
right?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1880-0
00:08:01.903 --> 00:08:05.333
They yeah, because of that, I
like not be able to go.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1887-0
00:08:05.463 --> 00:08:08.673
The catch the sequential concept
so.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1889-0
00:08:09.543 --> 00:08:10.853
OK, OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1909-0
00:08:11.703 --> 00:08:14.747
So the banking, so we were
explaining the idea of

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1909-1
00:08:14.747 --> 00:08:16.573
classification and clustering.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1915-0
00:08:17.373 --> 00:08:19.033
So is that clear to you?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1926-0
00:08:19.253 --> 00:08:21.343
You understood what is
classification and what is

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1926-1
00:08:21.343 --> 00:08:21.803
clustering.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1947-0
00:08:24.413 --> 00:08:27.423
Umm, actually The thing is that
that's the reason I.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1945-0
00:08:26.973 --> 00:08:28.983
No, Mr Mr Rashmi.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1976-0
00:08:28.993 --> 00:08:32.784
Bala, don't hesitate to say not
understood, because after all I

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1976-1
00:08:32.784 --> 00:08:35.923
you are you are registered for
the program to learn.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1997-0
00:08:33.763 --> 00:08:34.243
No, no, I.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2003-0
00:08:35.363 --> 00:08:38.991
No, no, I understood the price
overall concept like the Group

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/1991-0
00:08:35.933 --> 00:08:36.853
So what is the problem?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2003-1
00:08:38.991 --> 00:08:40.863
of Things and whatever the like.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2020-0
00:08:41.493 --> 00:08:45.483
And the Group, whatever we are
doing, the supposed Group

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2020-1
00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:46.043
example.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2044-0
00:08:46.193 --> 00:08:49.371
So I understood the concept, but
somehow I maybe I need to go

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2044-1
00:08:49.371 --> 00:08:51.473
through again so that that's the
reason.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2051-0
00:08:52.603 --> 00:08:54.253
It's see that is something we
do.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2064-0
00:08:54.263 --> 00:08:57.213
We expect that you do revise the
thing in the.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2122-0
00:08:57.223 --> 00:09:00.760
In fact, some people put it
explicitly in handout and in our

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2122-1
00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:04.181
handout it may have not have
been put, but whenever we say

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2122-2
00:09:04.181 --> 00:09:07.602
that there are 32 hours of
interaction, we expect that for

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2122-3
00:09:07.602 --> 00:09:11.313
after every two hours you spend
at least six hours in exploring

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2122-4
00:09:11.313 --> 00:09:12.473
the content further.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2147-0
00:09:12.793 --> 00:09:16.492
So that may not be just revising
or listening to the same

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2147-1
00:09:16.492 --> 00:09:19.043
recording, but it may be for
some time.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2178-0
00:09:19.053 --> 00:09:22.396
We went to listen to the
recording but further exploring,

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2178-1
00:09:22.396 --> 00:09:25.913
but in any case I'm more than
happy to go back to the slide.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2191-0
00:09:25.923 --> 00:09:28.693
If you say supervised machine
learn in classification is not

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2191-1
00:09:28.693 --> 00:09:29.193
understood.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2201-0
00:09:29.923 --> 00:09:31.973
OK, I don't I I I can go back.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2211-0
00:09:31.983 --> 00:09:33.083
Do you want me to go back there?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2215-0
00:09:34.493 --> 00:09:34.843
Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2219-0
00:09:34.853 --> 00:09:36.413
If when I least like fine.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2224-0
00:09:38.883 --> 00:09:41.243
Ah, OK, OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2245-0
00:09:42.593 --> 00:09:45.230
And I think you also had a
question about the sequential

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2245-1
00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:46.433
patterns, is that correct?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2250-0
00:09:46.923 --> 00:09:47.343
Yes, yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2251-0
00:09:48.213 --> 00:09:48.583
OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2272-0
00:09:48.653 --> 00:09:51.451
So let me finish also
association you understood the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2272-1
00:09:51.451 --> 00:09:54.143
patterns that we are looking at
are combinatorial.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2267-0
00:09:51.693 --> 00:09:51.813
Yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2283-0
00:09:54.473 --> 00:09:57.903
So that is at one day or at one
point of time.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2297-0
00:09:58.013 --> 00:10:02.243
What are all the items that the
family or the buyer is buying?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2304-0
00:10:03.133 --> 00:10:04.083
Uh, it is.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2321-0
00:10:04.093 --> 00:10:06.835
So this is you can you can
clearly make out it is

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2321-1
00:10:06.835 --> 00:10:07.603
combinatorial.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2348-0
00:10:08.033 --> 00:10:11.766
So we are not looking at any
sequence, so it doesn't mean

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2348-1
00:10:11.766 --> 00:10:15.886
that it so, but then there are
many problems where the sequence

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2348-2
00:10:15.886 --> 00:10:16.723
is important.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2407-0
00:10:17.193 --> 00:10:20.862
So one very simple example that
all of us can relate to is that

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2407-1
00:10:20.862 --> 00:10:24.646
suppose that somebody's having a
scooty or scooter or motorcycle,

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2407-2
00:10:24.646 --> 00:10:28.028
so you know that you buy the
scooter and then after buying

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2407-3
00:10:28.028 --> 00:10:31.755
the scooter they say that after
six months you have to come back

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2407-4
00:10:31.755 --> 00:10:32.443
for service.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2430-0
00:10:32.653 --> 00:10:35.248
Depending on the make, it may
make slightly different and then

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2430-1
00:10:35.248 --> 00:10:37.513
when they do the servicing they
change the engine oil.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2459-0
00:10:37.783 --> 00:10:41.328
So clearly they're saying that
if you buy a scooter today after

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2459-1
00:10:41.328 --> 00:10:44.153
six months, you have to buy a
liter of engine oil.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2466-0
00:10:44.623 --> 00:10:46.373
So that is a sequential pattern.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2469-0
00:10:46.943 --> 00:10:48.353
Is that clear?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2508-0
00:10:48.423 --> 00:10:52.690
It is also has some element of
Market Basket, but it also has a

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2508-1
00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:56.490
time lag between the two and
there are many other events

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2508-2
00:10:56.490 --> 00:11:00.023
which can be explained using the
sequential pattern.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2511-0
00:11:00.903 --> 00:11:01.863
I'm Mr ASMI.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2527-0
00:11:01.873 --> 00:11:05.503
Bala is that sequential and
combinatorial is clear, right?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2523-0
00:11:02.743 --> 00:11:03.553
Yeah, I.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2531-0
00:11:05.873 --> 00:11:06.273
Yes, yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2537-0
00:11:06.013 --> 00:11:09.403
OK, OK, so now now I will.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2553-0
00:11:09.653 --> 00:11:13.429
I I'm not very sure whether you
want really help with the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2553-1
00:11:13.429 --> 00:11:15.383
clustering and classification.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2588-0
00:11:15.773 --> 00:11:19.221
If so, if there is a some
requirement we can spend 5

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2588-1
00:11:19.221 --> 00:11:22.865
minutes that is not a problem
from my side but but then

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2588-2
00:11:22.865 --> 00:11:26.183
otherwise I would like to move
as far as possible.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2603-0
00:11:26.553 --> 00:11:29.664
So let me somebody, somebody has
raised the hand also please

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2603-1
00:11:29.664 --> 00:11:30.633
speak other person.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2614-0
00:11:34.323 --> 00:11:37.073
Somebody raised their hand in
between.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2616-0
00:11:37.183 --> 00:11:37.553
OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2632-0
00:11:37.623 --> 00:11:40.341
If there is no question, OK, let
me see if there is anything in

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2632-1
00:11:40.341 --> 00:11:40.893
the chat box.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2635-0
00:11:44.863 --> 00:11:47.273
OK. Ohh.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2638-0
00:11:50.643 --> 00:11:50.993
Alright.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2650-0
00:11:57.193 --> 00:11:57.973
OK, no problem.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2654-0
00:11:57.383 --> 00:11:59.263
You know what I think of cycle
life?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2663-0
00:12:00.203 --> 00:12:01.183
I think of it.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2667-0
00:12:01.703 --> 00:12:02.803
Umm.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2679-0
00:12:03.213 --> 00:12:05.583
I you know what I think the
cycle lies.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2705-0
00:12:06.133 --> 00:12:12.771
I think our cycle life and
electric sports bike and and a

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2705-1
00:12:12.771 --> 00:12:16.433
sports bike electric with gears.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2716-0
00:12:17.693 --> 00:12:19.963
I think over my cycle like that.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2724-0
00:12:20.393 --> 00:12:23.313
Yeah, electrical beginner.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2728-0
00:12:23.153 --> 00:12:25.103
Is this question what is this?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2736-0
00:12:25.533 --> 00:12:27.373
I I think maybe.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2744-0
00:12:27.883 --> 00:12:31.393
Ohh Charles Bob I I do not know.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2750-0
00:12:29.173 --> 00:12:31.503
No, no, no, I see.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2754-0
00:12:31.403 --> 00:12:32.163
Are you talking to me?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2767-0
00:12:33.783 --> 00:12:35.763
What is this question or doubt?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2766-0
00:12:34.133 --> 00:12:34.803
Why did you stop?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2782-0
00:12:37.743 --> 00:12:41.243
I I think maybe that person is
talking to someone else.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2807-0
00:12:42.553 --> 00:12:46.674
OK, so uh, so that's actually
the reason why sometimes we keep

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2807-1
00:12:46.674 --> 00:12:49.683
the whole session on mute, but
OK no problem.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2843-0
00:12:49.753 --> 00:12:53.492
And will the PPT for today's
session be uploaded here, here

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2843-1
00:12:53.492 --> 00:12:57.481
and means a canvas right in the
canvas, the same place where we

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2843-2
00:12:57.481 --> 00:12:59.663
uploaded the first session
slides.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2866-0
00:12:59.673 --> 00:13:02.938
So we will also upload the
second session, so if I remember

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2866-1
00:13:02.938 --> 00:13:05.823
I'll save it with the annotation
and then upload it.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2924-0
00:13:05.873 --> 00:13:10.608
OK, so because the annotation is
actually, I increase the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2924-1
00:13:10.608 --> 00:13:15.425
significantly the size and and
you know, you know if it is

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2924-2
00:13:15.425 --> 00:13:20.323
shared with 100 people, it's
obviously it is increasing the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2924-3
00:13:20.323 --> 00:13:25.059
IT has a more byte footprint,
but OK, that's that any any

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2924-4
00:13:25.059 --> 00:13:27.263
other question from anyone?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2928-0
00:13:27.393 --> 00:13:28.473
Alright, we'll proceed further.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2936-0
00:13:33.653 --> 00:13:34.253
Uh, sorry.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2966-0
00:13:34.263 --> 00:13:37.672
In the sequential pattern
Discovery, if the event is going

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2966-1
00:13:37.672 --> 00:13:41.023
to occur occur in the patterns,
so it means there is some

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2966-2
00:13:41.023 --> 00:13:42.583
dependency in the previous.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2990-0
00:13:42.593 --> 00:13:46.623
I mean, I mean, prior to this
discovering pattern, right,

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2990-1
00:13:46.623 --> 00:13:47.943
that's what that's.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/2986-0
00:13:47.343 --> 00:13:48.993
Uh, OK, OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3006-0
00:13:49.003 --> 00:13:53.430
OK, let me let me go back and
sequential is actually little

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3006-1
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:55.053
more tricky than that.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3019-0
00:13:55.143 --> 00:13:58.373
I just want to skip it, but then
yes, go ahead.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3023-0
00:13:58.423 --> 00:13:58.773
Go ahead.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3027-0
00:13:58.783 --> 00:13:59.633
Since you brought it up.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3036-0
00:13:59.643 --> 00:14:01.603
Yeah, let us let us let us talk.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3043-0
00:14:01.763 --> 00:14:02.533
So what is the?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3061-0
00:14:02.543 --> 00:14:05.543
What is the question, either
with one of these slides, right?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3055-0
00:14:06.533 --> 00:14:06.823
Hmm.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3063-0
00:14:06.833 --> 00:14:07.933
Yeah, 38 slides.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3078-0
00:14:07.943 --> 00:14:10.616
So there even the timing
constant, everything have been

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3078-1
00:14:10.616 --> 00:14:11.093
mentioned.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3081-0
00:14:11.103 --> 00:14:11.743
Yes, yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3098-0
00:14:11.103 --> 00:14:16.126
So if D&amp;E for example Dey
that combination is giving that

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3098-1
00:14:16.126 --> 00:14:18.233
that is an event occurred.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3114-0
00:14:18.523 --> 00:14:23.649
So that event occurrence is
having a dependency on C or a B,

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3102-0
00:14:18.703 --> 00:14:18.903
Hmm.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3129-0
00:14:22.113 --> 00:14:22.283
Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3114-1
00:14:23.649 --> 00:14:24.153
right?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3139-0
00:14:24.163 --> 00:14:27.004
So that's the that's the
original concept of sequential

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3139-1
00:14:27.004 --> 00:14:28.273
pattern means am I right?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3134-0
00:14:28.033 --> 00:14:29.163
Ah, see.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3157-0
00:14:29.173 --> 00:14:32.606
See in fact, the sequential
patterns are studied for many

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3157-1
00:14:32.606 --> 00:14:34.323
regions, not just one region.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3179-0
00:14:34.833 --> 00:14:39.125
One of the reasons why people
study the sequential pattern is

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3165-0
00:14:35.333 --> 00:14:35.603
OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3179-1
00:14:39.125 --> 00:14:41.133
study of the gene sequencing.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3214-0
00:14:42.213 --> 00:14:47.084
So in gene sequencing, the point
is that offers now know and

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3214-1
00:14:47.084 --> 00:14:52.274
claim that yes, it is the genes
that decide so many things about

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3214-2
00:14:52.274 --> 00:14:53.153
the people.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3274-0
00:14:53.663 --> 00:14:58.511
But then I hope if some of you I
I do not know if you work, but

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3274-1
00:14:58.511 --> 00:15:03.132
you know that the gene sequence
is not a very single byte or

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3274-2
00:15:03.132 --> 00:15:07.754
it's it is a very very long
sequence and then to map certain

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3274-3
00:15:07.754 --> 00:15:11.693
part to the certain
characteristics is not so easy.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3301-0
00:15:12.223 --> 00:15:16.368
And then also finding a pattern
which is for example, two

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3301-1
00:15:16.368 --> 00:15:20.798
creatures are having similarity
and you got the gene sequence

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3301-2
00:15:20.798 --> 00:15:22.013
for both of them.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3330-0
00:15:22.143 --> 00:15:25.690
So now if you want to find
similarity then again it when

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3330-1
00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:29.362
the gene sequence is suppose
it's running into millions of

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3330-2
00:15:29.362 --> 00:15:29.673
bits.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3343-0
00:15:30.103 --> 00:15:32.793
So you can see that the problem
is not so easy.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3381-0
00:15:33.143 --> 00:15:36.579
So you need to know what is
occurring after what and what is

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3381-1
00:15:36.579 --> 00:15:39.958
the length of the same sequence
that is repeating and is it

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3381-2
00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:42.718
possible that this sequence is
impacting certain

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3381-3
00:15:42.718 --> 00:15:43.563
characteristic?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3454-0
00:15:44.173 --> 00:15:47.491
Mr Ranganathan, have I clarified
it a little bit because the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3399-0
00:15:46.793 --> 00:15:47.013
Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3454-1
00:15:47.491 --> 00:15:50.917
problem is a lot more complex
than what we are doing is we are

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3454-2
00:15:50.917 --> 00:15:54.507
trying to explain it very simply
saying that yes, we one simplest

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3454-3
00:15:54.507 --> 00:15:57.172
sequential problem is that
suppose you buy today

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3454-4
00:15:57.172 --> 00:16:00.218
introduction to data science,
the bookshop owner can be

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3454-5
00:16:00.218 --> 00:16:03.046
assured that tomorrow you're
going to buy a book on

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3454-6
00:16:03.046 --> 00:16:03.753
deeplearning.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3486-0
00:16:04.683 --> 00:16:09.598
So we can possibly simplify that
as a as the nature of the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3486-1
00:16:09.598 --> 00:16:14.930
problem, but the nature of the
problem in different context can

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3486-2
00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:17.513
take different approach styles.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3508-0
00:16:17.583 --> 00:16:21.551
So in that case it is not really
that time sequencing that we are

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3508-1
00:16:21.551 --> 00:16:22.393
talking about.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3533-0
00:16:22.783 --> 00:16:27.167
We are talking about one
occurring after the other, and

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3533-1
00:16:27.167 --> 00:16:31.943
similarly suppose that you are
looking at the web clicks to.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3556-0
00:16:32.013 --> 00:16:35.448
There are people who analyze the
pattern of usage and then what

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3556-1
00:16:35.448 --> 00:16:37.863
is bringing the business and so
many things.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3564-0
00:16:38.133 --> 00:16:40.603
So the sequence of web clicks
become important.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3583-0
00:16:40.613 --> 00:16:43.376
And do you want to consider only
the previous click or previous

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3583-1
00:16:43.376 --> 00:16:44.283
five clicks are what?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3622-0
00:16:44.333 --> 00:16:48.403
How many number of clicks and
then so again the intention is

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3622-1
00:16:48.403 --> 00:16:52.540
that you find a pattern but then
the definition for a pattern

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3622-2
00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:55.143
itself you don't want me to
freeze it.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3646-0
00:16:55.153 --> 00:16:58.233
So there can be various
definitions for patterns, but

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3646-1
00:16:58.233 --> 00:17:01.143
then the patterns that we set is
a broad category.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3702-0
00:17:01.153 --> 00:17:05.425
When we set classification
association clustering and

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3702-1
00:17:05.425 --> 00:17:09.776
anomaly or sequential so and
within the association, a

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3702-2
00:17:09.776 --> 00:17:13.494
combinatorial or sequential,
it's a very broad

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3702-3
00:17:13.494 --> 00:17:18.240
categorization, but there are
scores of algorithms for each

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3702-4
00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:23.145
type of problem, and then each
each one has its own strength,

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3702-5
00:17:23.145 --> 00:17:25.123
weakness and application.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3709-0
00:17:28.023 --> 00:17:28.603
Are we In Sync?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3710-0
00:17:29.573 --> 00:17:29.983
Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3712-0
00:17:29.993 --> 00:17:30.383
OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3716-0
00:17:30.833 --> 00:17:31.193
Thank you.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3717-0
00:17:32.013 --> 00:17:32.393
All right.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3739-0
00:17:42.293 --> 00:17:47.227
So we were when we closed the
last session, we were discussing

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3739-1
00:17:47.227 --> 00:17:50.203
about the processes for data
science.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3798-0
00:17:50.533 --> 00:17:55.057
So we look first at the, the
this we had already studied we

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3798-1
00:17:55.057 --> 00:17:59.807
this is just an example flying
the software engineering and we

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3798-2
00:17:59.807 --> 00:18:04.558
know that data science is very
closely related to the computer

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3798-3
00:18:04.558 --> 00:18:08.931
science and then software
engineering is what many of the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3798-4
00:18:08.931 --> 00:18:11.193
computing professionals do so.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3855-0
00:18:11.363 --> 00:18:16.112
So we'll look at the the process
that is followed and it has a

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3855-1
00:18:16.112 --> 00:18:20.635
significant impact on what what
is the way the data science

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3855-2
00:18:20.635 --> 00:18:25.007
tasks are done then what we had
seen is that the question

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3855-3
00:18:25.007 --> 00:18:29.454
requirement of analysis and
design, they're not going away

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3855-4
00:18:29.454 --> 00:18:30.133
anywhere.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3910-0
00:18:30.683 --> 00:18:35.051
But then nomenclature that you
need to do is changing and then

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3910-1
00:18:35.051 --> 00:18:39.141
in machine learning you are not
doing a design but you are

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3910-2
00:18:39.141 --> 00:18:43.578
trying to create a model and so
so it's again the model becomes

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3910-3
00:18:43.578 --> 00:18:47.599
with supervised machine learning
and unsupervised machine

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3910-4
00:18:47.599 --> 00:18:48.223
learning.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3930-0
00:18:48.233 --> 00:18:52.108
The concept model has slightly
different, so let's just take it

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3930-1
00:18:52.108 --> 00:18:54.833
that, OK, so we are trying to
build a model.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3953-0
00:18:54.843 --> 00:18:59.334
So the model may have some
discovery element within it and

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3953-1
00:18:59.334 --> 00:19:02.303
then that is what we are trying
to do.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3955-0
00:19:02.783 --> 00:19:03.393
So.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3977-0
00:19:03.443 --> 00:19:08.420
So what what we know for sure is
that software engineering is

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3977-1
00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:12.353
that requirements requirements
are clear, right?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3983-0
00:19:12.533 --> 00:19:15.063
So analysis clarifies
requirements.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3987-0
00:19:25.893 --> 00:19:26.473
Requirements.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/3998-0
00:19:29.443 --> 00:19:34.663
And design and construction
implement the requirements.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4009-0
00:19:40.463 --> 00:19:42.633
So it's as simple as that.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4021-0
00:19:42.993 --> 00:19:45.973
So we have a problem and we have
a solution.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4045-0
00:19:45.983 --> 00:19:49.684
Analysis recognizes the problem
and design and constructions

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4045-1
00:19:49.684 --> 00:19:53.386
finds the solution, but now in
data science we have a tricky

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4045-2
00:19:53.386 --> 00:19:53.993
situation.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4057-0
00:19:54.423 --> 00:19:57.233
So what we are saying is that
the problem.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4100-0
00:19:57.283 --> 00:20:02.598
Yes, the problem is more like we
want to find a pattern, so that

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4100-1
00:20:02.598 --> 00:20:07.669
is really does a pattern exist
and then 2 for that we need to

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4100-2
00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:12.003
identify what is the type of the
data that can help.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4140-0
00:20:12.053 --> 00:20:17.247
So possibly that that starts the
solution cycle, so identifying

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4140-1
00:20:17.247 --> 00:20:22.116
the necessary data and then
within the data we need to find

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4140-2
00:20:22.116 --> 00:20:26.823
the model that will express the
patterns within the data.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4147-0
00:20:26.913 --> 00:20:28.193
So there.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4178-0
00:20:28.253 --> 00:20:32.186
So the point is that in spite of
the fact focus that every

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4178-1
00:20:32.186 --> 00:20:36.320
machine learning book says that
yes, you are creating a model

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4178-2
00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:37.253
from the data.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4205-0
00:20:37.673 --> 00:20:42.331
So we need to understand that
there is an algorithm and we

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4205-1
00:20:42.331 --> 00:20:46.753
will look at some algorithms
whereby we create a model.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4238-0
00:20:47.243 --> 00:20:50.738
So the construction of the
algorithm itself requires some

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4238-1
00:20:50.738 --> 00:20:54.595
coding, and today we may not do
a lot of coding because many of

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4238-2
00:20:54.595 --> 00:20:58.031
those algorithms have been
already incorporated into the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4238-3
00:20:58.031 --> 00:20:58.513
library.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4290-0
00:20:58.523 --> 00:21:01.927
So either the Python library or
libraries, so if you go and see

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4290-1
00:21:01.927 --> 00:21:05.118
that the Python because there
are so many enthusiastic open

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4290-2
00:21:05.118 --> 00:21:08.415
source community members who
have implemented so all you need

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4290-3
00:21:08.415 --> 00:21:11.713
to do is to just invoke those
algorithms and get the results.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4331-0
00:21:12.363 --> 00:21:15.847
But then the algorithm exists
and is implemented, and that is

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4331-1
00:21:15.847 --> 00:21:19.331
pretty much like a development,
because you're writing a code

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4331-2
00:21:19.331 --> 00:21:22.534
which is which has a logic
within, and that algorithm is

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4331-3
00:21:22.534 --> 00:21:23.883
representing that logic.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4376-0
00:21:24.483 --> 00:21:29.420
So once that is done, what you
see is a pattern which is

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4376-1
00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:34.877
possibly expressing the kind of
right the the relations within

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4376-2
00:21:34.877 --> 00:21:40.593
the data or or the understanding
or insights that you gather from

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4376-3
00:21:40.593 --> 00:21:41.373
the data.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4408-0
00:21:42.763 --> 00:21:46.342
So I hope that clarifies how the
data science process is

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4408-1
00:21:46.342 --> 00:21:49.858
different from software
engineering process and we have

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4408-2
00:21:49.858 --> 00:21:51.993
looked at the crisp DM
framework.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4430-0
00:21:52.463 --> 00:21:56.213
So apparently that is one of the
more popular frameworks that is

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4430-1
00:21:56.213 --> 00:21:57.483
used for data science.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4478-0
00:21:58.483 --> 00:22:03.793
And then we have looked at the
details of the phases and tasks

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4478-1
00:22:03.793 --> 00:22:08.850
and we have also looked at the
booklet that is published by

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4478-2
00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:14.244
these people in the data Science
Process Alliance Group and the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4478-3
00:22:14.244 --> 00:22:16.183
URL is in front of you.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4482-0
00:22:16.233 --> 00:22:17.203
And we looked at it.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4506-0
00:22:17.273 --> 00:22:20.498
So you can explore it further
and if there is further

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4506-1
00:22:20.498 --> 00:22:23.723
discussion is required, we can
do this and this part.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4522-0
00:22:23.733 --> 00:22:26.499
I don't think we have reached in
the last class, so this is the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4522-1
00:22:26.499 --> 00:22:27.363
there are alternate.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4527-0
00:22:31.153 --> 00:22:32.283
Two crisp DM.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4611-0
00:22:34.923 --> 00:22:39.309
Just be a bit that these are not
very, very different from that,

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4611-1
00:22:39.309 --> 00:22:43.021
but they are trying to present
the steps in a slightly

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4611-2
00:22:43.021 --> 00:22:47.137
different way and they're trying
to differentiate themselves

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4611-3
00:22:47.137 --> 00:22:51.388
through some elements, but not
really not really a significant

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4611-4
00:22:51.388 --> 00:22:55.707
because and also many times they
also go for a new nomenclature

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4611-5
00:22:55.707 --> 00:22:59.689
that puts us into into the
problem that what is really how

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4611-6
00:22:59.689 --> 00:23:01.983
are they significantly
different.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4620-0
00:23:02.543 --> 00:23:05.793
But then be be be busy.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4642-0
00:23:05.803 --> 00:23:09.789
You can say that it's an
alternate process which is again

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4642-1
00:23:09.789 --> 00:23:13.363
working with the the data in a
particular sequence.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4660-0
00:23:13.373 --> 00:23:16.495
Particularly, they focus is more
on big data, but then finding

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4660-1
00:23:16.495 --> 00:23:17.783
the patterns and big data.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4687-0
00:23:17.793 --> 00:23:21.260
In fact, we know that we are
looking for patterns because

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4687-1
00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:25.027
there is so much data for which
the querying is not an option,

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4687-2
00:23:25.027 --> 00:23:26.103
not a possibility.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4727-0
00:23:26.613 --> 00:23:30.703
So only thing is that we can
look for patterns so so the big

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4727-1
00:23:30.703 --> 00:23:34.793
data is a very good example
where doing a query is not a not

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4727-2
00:23:34.793 --> 00:23:38.883
a very comfortable proposition,
but discovering patterns is.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4785-0
00:23:42.563 --> 00:23:47.097
And then SEMA is proposed by CS,
so they are one of the popular

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4785-1
00:23:47.097 --> 00:23:51.135
tools in the data science and
they talk in terms of data

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4785-2
00:23:51.135 --> 00:23:55.315
science tasks, in terms of their
sampling, exploring, then

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4785-3
00:23:55.315 --> 00:23:59.494
preprocessing the data and then
modeling the data and then

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4785-4
00:23:59.494 --> 00:24:01.053
assessing the results.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4809-0
00:24:01.443 --> 00:24:04.268
And again, they talk in terms of
iteration after the model is

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4809-1
00:24:04.268 --> 00:24:07.003
assessed, you go back and then
start repeating the process.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4814-0
00:24:07.853 --> 00:24:10.693
Uh, by making some changes?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4832-0
00:24:15.443 --> 00:24:22.513
And then there is a SM AM, which
is proposed by one group.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4842-0
00:24:22.523 --> 00:24:25.393
Which clients itself as data
science association.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4884-0
00:24:25.763 --> 00:24:30.418
So here we are talking about a
cycle based the use case and

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4884-1
00:24:30.418 --> 00:24:35.462
then we are talking about gather
requirements gathering and then

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4884-2
00:24:35.462 --> 00:24:40.350
performing some experiments and
then working with the proof of

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4884-3
00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:44.463
value return on investment, then
operationalization.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4893-0
00:24:44.953 --> 00:24:46.343
So this is a.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4916-0
00:24:46.393 --> 00:24:49.916
This is again not very much
different and you can see that

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4916-1
00:24:49.916 --> 00:24:52.603
they have a slightly different
nomenclature.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4921-0
00:24:52.613 --> 00:24:53.703
Yeah, someone has a question.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4927-0
00:24:57.673 --> 00:24:58.803
Someone has a question for me?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4932-0
00:25:00.823 --> 00:25:01.673
No question.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4951-0
00:25:06.153 --> 00:25:10.153
I I'm assuming no question, so
let me proceed further.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4965-0
00:25:15.083 --> 00:25:19.513
And then finally, there are new
terms that are coming up.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4993-0
00:25:19.923 --> 00:25:24.031
So so we need to understand why
and what for these terms have

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/4993-1
00:25:24.031 --> 00:25:28.073
come up and what is it that the
people are trying to convey.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5009-0
00:25:28.123 --> 00:25:34.963
So the two terms that we talk
about are data OPS and ML OPS.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5019-0
00:25:38.713 --> 00:25:40.543
Is everybody familiar with the
DevOps?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5027-0
00:25:48.173 --> 00:25:49.713
People are familiar with DevOps,
right?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5034-0
00:25:50.523 --> 00:25:51.393
Yes, OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5049-0
00:25:51.593 --> 00:25:53.473
OK, Mr Gotta pass form.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5046-0
00:25:51.683 --> 00:25:51.863
Yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5045-0
00:25:51.933 --> 00:25:52.143
Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5048-0
00:25:52.943 --> 00:25:53.883
Yeah, creating a pipeline.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5055-0
00:25:55.073 --> 00:25:56.263
Yes, it's.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5063-0
00:25:56.333 --> 00:25:59.483
So what exactly is really the
concept behind it?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5077-0
00:25:59.493 --> 00:26:03.303
What is it that why they need to
bring in a new nomenclature?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5089-0
00:26:05.463 --> 00:26:06.403
Maybe we can.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5123-0
00:26:05.563 --> 00:26:11.016
The main idea is to automate the
entire SDLC cycle right from you

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5123-1
00:26:11.016 --> 00:26:15.064
know the elopement or and
testing part of it and

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5123-2
00:26:15.064 --> 00:26:15.973
deployment.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5142-0
00:26:16.313 --> 00:26:19.023
All those gets into a pipeline.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5125-0
00:26:16.793 --> 00:26:17.403
OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5128-0
00:26:17.613 --> 00:26:18.243
Yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5131-0
00:26:18.253 --> 00:26:18.703
OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5137-0
00:26:18.873 --> 00:26:20.063
No problem, no problem.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5143-0
00:26:20.073 --> 00:26:20.873
Adds adds.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5147-0
00:26:20.883 --> 00:26:22.003
You are answering so.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5183-0
00:26:22.093 --> 00:26:25.654
So what is the meaning of
automation so so really because

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5183-1
00:26:25.654 --> 00:26:29.215
one thing when we started
software development started as

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5183-2
00:26:29.215 --> 00:26:33.083
a profession, they said we are
trying to automate the process.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5199-0
00:26:33.493 --> 00:26:36.023
But now here we are saying that
we are automating something.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5202-0
00:26:33.973 --> 00:26:34.703
Pick to market.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5206-0
00:26:36.033 --> 00:26:36.393
What is that?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5212-0
00:26:37.083 --> 00:26:37.863
Click to market.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5228-0
00:26:39.293 --> 00:26:40.623
Elimination of manual efforts.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5226-0
00:26:39.343 --> 00:26:40.273
Greek to market?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5252-0
00:26:40.923 --> 00:26:44.492
And the benefit is quick to
market, but the idea behind is

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5252-1
00:26:44.492 --> 00:26:48.303
that minimum human intervention,
the flow should go, you know.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5260-0
00:26:48.013 --> 00:26:50.223
The continuous integration and
deployment.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5270-0
00:26:48.673 --> 00:26:52.023
And yeah, you continuous
process.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5266-0
00:26:50.613 --> 00:26:51.473
OK, alright.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5273-0
00:26:50.753 --> 00:26:52.393
Continuous integration and
different.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5268-0
00:26:52.853 --> 00:26:53.283
OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5276-0
00:26:53.333 --> 00:26:54.083
Yeah. Alright.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5286-0
00:26:54.093 --> 00:26:56.503
So I'm hitting a the NS.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5299-0
00:26:56.653 --> 00:26:59.505
Two other terms which are
popularly used in the context of

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5299-1
00:26:59.505 --> 00:26:59.843
DevOps.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5306-0
00:27:00.323 --> 00:27:00.963
So.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5321-0
00:27:00.973 --> 00:27:07.223
So the point is that so DevOps
actually is a more offshoot.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5312-0
00:27:01.653 --> 00:27:02.223
I see.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5360-0
00:27:07.433 --> 00:27:11.909
If my understanding of whatever
I observed in the industry is

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5360-1
00:27:11.909 --> 00:27:16.024
clear so till 19 till 2000,
possibly nobody ever thought

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5360-2
00:27:16.024 --> 00:27:20.211
that they need to because the
software itself is meant to

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5360-3
00:27:20.211 --> 00:27:21.583
automate a process.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5368-0
00:27:21.853 --> 00:27:23.263
So that is a business process.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5379-0
00:27:23.273 --> 00:27:27.243
We are auto then then the what?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5389-0
00:27:27.253 --> 00:27:31.113
The some movement that started
that is called Azle development.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5392-0
00:27:32.183 --> 00:27:32.413
Umm.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5418-0
00:27:32.233 --> 00:27:36.768
So these people have brought in
several concepts, saying that

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5418-1
00:27:36.768 --> 00:27:41.011
working software is more
important than documentation and

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5418-2
00:27:41.011 --> 00:27:44.083
people are more important than
processes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5423-0
00:27:44.093 --> 00:27:44.863
And whatnot.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5465-0
00:27:45.333 --> 00:27:49.949
So it was like they started with
some manifesto and and then many

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5465-1
00:27:49.949 --> 00:27:54.356
people hung on to it because my
not if it is reducing the work

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5465-2
00:27:54.356 --> 00:27:57.713
and giving a quick delivery, why
not go for it?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5489-0
00:27:58.823 --> 00:28:04.072
And so in the asile, the idea is
that the delivery is always very

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5489-1
00:28:04.072 --> 00:28:07.253
small increments many, many
increments.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5502-0
00:28:07.583 --> 00:28:09.843
So you start delivering after
every few weeks.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5549-0
00:28:10.883 --> 00:28:13.750
So once you have to deliver
after every few weeks, so the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5549-1
00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:16.814
integration itself has to happen
every because previously the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5549-2
00:28:16.814 --> 00:28:19.977
delivery he used to be more in a
batch mode that is after three

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5549-3
00:28:19.977 --> 00:28:22.053
months or six months you make a
delivery.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5567-0
00:28:22.523 --> 00:28:26.370
But here we are talking about a
delivery of every week or every

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5567-1
00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:27.873
two weeks or three weeks.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5587-0
00:28:27.913 --> 00:28:31.808
So what that means is that as
the new delivery comes, they

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5587-1
00:28:31.808 --> 00:28:34.383
need a mechanism to do an
integration.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5632-0
00:28:35.213 --> 00:28:38.702
So so it is more like the IT is
the rapid cycles that are

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5632-1
00:28:38.702 --> 00:28:42.250
creating then need saying that
OK let's have some level of

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5632-2
00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:46.220
automation so that we don't need
to worry as long as soon as they

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5632-3
00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:47.303
bring in the code.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5646-0
00:28:47.933 --> 00:28:51.419
So there is an automated process
to absorb that into the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5646-1
00:28:51.419 --> 00:28:52.643
production software.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5660-0
00:28:53.653 --> 00:28:56.183
Uh, so I hope all of us are In
Sync.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5669-0
00:28:56.233 --> 00:28:59.583
Or am I telling something some
different story than you?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5683-0
00:28:59.593 --> 00:29:02.623
People want to tell it's the
same story, right?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5689-0
00:29:05.813 --> 00:29:06.043
Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5695-0
00:29:06.423 --> 00:29:07.973
The yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5694-0
00:29:06.543 --> 00:29:06.773
Yep.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5700-0
00:29:07.653 --> 00:29:07.853
Yep.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5732-0
00:29:07.983 --> 00:29:11.112
OK, because in fact the story is
interesting word there is there

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5732-1
00:29:11.112 --> 00:29:14.193
was a time when people used to
say that we gather requirements,

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5732-2
00:29:14.193 --> 00:29:16.793
but then asile people said that
we'll gather stories.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5734-0
00:29:16.803 --> 00:29:17.193
So.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5765-0
00:29:17.423 --> 00:29:21.161
So whatever impossibly they hear
when they when they use the word

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5765-1
00:29:21.161 --> 00:29:24.220
stories, probably that gives
them something which the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5765-2
00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:26.033
requirements don't give so much.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5777-0
00:29:26.043 --> 00:29:28.113
Like, OK, why not go for a new
terminology?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5843-0
00:29:28.903 --> 00:29:33.478
So OK, so the ML OPS and data
OPS are obviously these are the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5843-1
00:29:33.478 --> 00:29:37.979
offshoots that when software
development has DevOps, why the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5843-2
00:29:37.979 --> 00:29:42.480
machine learning should lag
behind and say that we are doing

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5843-3
00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:46.834
work in a batch mode, uh, So
what they started doing is to

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5843-4
00:29:46.834 --> 00:29:51.261
bring in some nomenclature and
bringing in some some things

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5843-5
00:29:51.261 --> 00:29:52.663
that differentiate.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5866-0
00:29:52.933 --> 00:29:56.916
So for example we the data
preprocessing is a significant

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5866-1
00:29:56.916 --> 00:30:00.143
activity in many of the data
science projects.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5879-0
00:30:01.293 --> 00:30:04.984
So as they do this, they can
possibly integrate and create

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5879-1
00:30:04.984 --> 00:30:06.173
the data pipelines.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5896-0
00:30:07.873 --> 00:30:12.963
And the possibly that will that
will be continuous basis.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5940-0
00:30:12.973 --> 00:30:18.712
So that is as in as soon as they
discover a new data source or a

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5940-1
00:30:18.712 --> 00:30:24.098
new data mode, or I will say a
new data source or a new data

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5940-2
00:30:24.098 --> 00:30:26.923
format, or a new data structure.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5969-0
00:30:27.533 --> 00:30:33.308
You need to have a mechanism to
incorporate that in a rapid

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5969-1
00:30:33.308 --> 00:30:39.083
manner, so this is what seems to
be the intent of data OPS.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/5977-0
00:30:39.153 --> 00:30:41.803
So are there any data OPS
experts?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6000-0
00:30:41.813 --> 00:30:45.069
So somebody who is working and
they refer to within their

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6000-1
00:30:45.069 --> 00:30:47.483
organization what they call as a
data OPS.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6008-0
00:30:56.593 --> 00:30:58.403
OK, so fine, fine.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6032-0
00:30:58.413 --> 00:31:02.490
So this is a nomenclature and
what we are saying is that

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6032-1
00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:05.923
bringing in automation into the
data pipelines.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6052-0
00:31:06.073 --> 00:31:11.325
So this is this is one way in
which this picture is not really

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6052-1
00:31:11.325 --> 00:31:12.743
telling too much.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6071-0
00:31:13.053 --> 00:31:16.316
All we are saying is that there
are several activities that need

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6071-1
00:31:16.316 --> 00:31:18.123
to happen within the data
pipeline.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6089-0
00:31:18.413 --> 00:31:23.727
So why not include the
automation, alerts, dashboards

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6089-1
00:31:23.727 --> 00:31:24.613
etcetera?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6119-0
00:31:25.083 --> 00:31:30.654
So thereby what we are having,
what we are having is that the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6119-1
00:31:30.654 --> 00:31:36.316
process is getting more smooth
and and then possibly the cycle

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6119-2
00:31:36.316 --> 00:31:38.293
time can also improve.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6140-0
00:31:41.673 --> 00:31:48.012
And now we will look at another
term that is that was brought up

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6140-1
00:31:48.012 --> 00:31:49.573
which is ML OPS.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6158-0
00:31:50.013 --> 00:31:54.548
So the DevOps as some of you
have already pointed out, deals

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6158-1
00:31:54.548 --> 00:31:55.663
with two terms.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6160-0
00:31:55.673 --> 00:31:57.983
One needs continuous
integration.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6169-0
00:31:59.963 --> 00:32:03.993
And continuous deployment or
continuous delivery.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6171-0
00:32:04.063 --> 00:32:04.283
OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6189-0
00:32:05.073 --> 00:32:09.081
Now, now the question is that ML
systems also we want the same

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6189-1
00:32:09.081 --> 00:32:09.463
thing.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6191-0
00:32:09.473 --> 00:32:10.003
Why not?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6224-0
00:32:10.553 --> 00:32:15.577
Why not integrate the new data
sources or et cetera continuous

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6224-1
00:32:15.577 --> 00:32:20.600
basis and build the model and
then give a incremental or a new

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6224-2
00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:22.833
model on a continuous basis?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6250-0
00:32:23.653 --> 00:32:29.120
So what the recognized is that a
new word that is required is

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6250-1
00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:32.823
that ML OPS requires continuous
training.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6270-0
00:32:33.473 --> 00:32:39.320
So that is adds new data or new
formats or new structures that

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6270-1
00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:40.063
come in.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6301-0
00:32:40.593 --> 00:32:44.960
So we need to validate that the
training that is adequate or a

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6301-1
00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:49.188
retraining is required for the
models because the models are

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6301-2
00:32:49.188 --> 00:32:51.753
constructed by training on the
data.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6309-0
00:32:54.293 --> 00:32:56.533
And this this two.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6335-0
00:32:58.903 --> 00:33:03.455
OK, this ML OPS so we are
looking at the Google Cloud page

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6335-1
00:33:03.455 --> 00:33:06.233
where they're talking about ML
OPS.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6339-0
00:33:06.483 --> 00:33:07.413
So.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6343-0
00:33:07.483 --> 00:33:08.773
So they're talking about.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6351-0
00:33:08.853 --> 00:33:10.973
I do not know how clear this
picture is.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6370-0
00:33:14.223 --> 00:33:16.163
But I thought it doesn't make
sense for me.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6379-0
00:33:15.643 --> 00:33:17.203
It's clear we can read, yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6372-0
00:33:17.473 --> 00:33:17.833
Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6376-0
00:33:17.843 --> 00:33:18.203
OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6381-0
00:33:18.273 --> 00:33:19.763
So thank you for that.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6439-0
00:33:19.773 --> 00:33:24.171
So all we are saying is you can
see that what they are talking

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6439-1
00:33:24.171 --> 00:33:28.359
about, they are talking about
automated pipeline and saying

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6439-2
00:33:28.359 --> 00:33:32.478
that yes, so as the data comes
in, they're doing doing all

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6439-3
00:33:32.478 --> 00:33:36.526
automation and then maintaining
a model registry and then

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6439-4
00:33:36.526 --> 00:33:40.226
maintaining the other activity
other things like the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6439-5
00:33:40.226 --> 00:33:41.343
performance and.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6454-0
00:33:42.953 --> 00:33:45.919
So this is representing the
continuous training that we're

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6454-1
00:33:45.919 --> 00:33:46.623
talking about.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6474-0
00:33:47.013 --> 00:33:51.286
So and then the the orchestrated
experiment is to validate

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6474-1
00:33:51.286 --> 00:33:53.893
whether the model still works
well.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6486-0
00:33:58.443 --> 00:34:02.093
So this URL is given in the
slide deck.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6503-0
00:34:02.103 --> 00:34:06.210
So so some of you who are
interested in further

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6503-1
00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:08.093
exploration can study.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6509-0
00:34:08.103 --> 00:34:08.893
I think this is a.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6527-0
00:34:08.943 --> 00:34:12.874
There are several contents that
Google presents as what they

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6527-1
00:34:12.874 --> 00:34:14.743
think is the email or ML OPS.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6555-0
00:34:22.043 --> 00:34:27.394
Sir, when we say ML basically or
data offs it's a converting the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6539-0
00:34:22.243 --> 00:34:23.543
All right, yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6555-1
00:34:27.394 --> 00:34:30.193
unstructured data in a
structure.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6579-0
00:34:30.203 --> 00:34:33.553
Is it the right statement? No.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6576-0
00:34:31.333 --> 00:34:34.333
No, no, no, no, no, no, it is
not really neat.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6604-0
00:34:34.343 --> 00:34:37.591
Receipt see the data
transformation is always part of

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6604-1
00:34:37.591 --> 00:34:41.080
the data pipeline, but then not
necessarily because it is

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6604-2
00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:42.163
unstructured data.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6609-0
00:34:42.173 --> 00:34:43.053
Structured data.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6625-0
00:34:43.313 --> 00:34:46.170
For example, you are getting
data from two sources where

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6625-1
00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:47.573
which is in American source.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6671-0
00:34:47.583 --> 00:34:51.066
That puts date in mmddyy format
and something is an Indian

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6671-1
00:34:51.066 --> 00:34:54.668
source with they put the data
and ddmmyyyy format so that is

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6671-2
00:34:54.668 --> 00:34:58.328
still part of the data pipeline
so that needs to be automated

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6671-3
00:34:58.328 --> 00:34:59.273
send integrated.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6696-0
00:35:00.223 --> 00:35:02.936
Having is that clear, both are
structured data, so there is

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6696-1
00:35:02.936 --> 00:35:05.333
nothing like it has to be
unstructured to structure.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6706-0
00:35:05.403 --> 00:35:07.193
But it is also possible that it
is.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6709-0
00:35:07.203 --> 00:35:07.673
It is.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6715-0
00:35:07.783 --> 00:35:09.993
The data can be of wide
varieties.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6723-0
00:35:12.593 --> 00:35:13.153
Are we In Sync?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6724-0
00:35:14.163 --> 00:35:14.733
Yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6749-0
00:35:14.743 --> 00:35:19.728
So basically means in in this
data OPS we are making kind of a

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6749-1
00:35:19.728 --> 00:35:21.153
patterns within a.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6768-0
00:35:21.203 --> 00:35:24.533
This process is itself or like
method to this.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6761-0
00:35:23.423 --> 00:35:24.073
Yes, yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6765-0
00:35:24.183 --> 00:35:25.663
See see.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6800-0
00:35:25.673 --> 00:35:29.451
It is pretty much the same thing
like what happens in DevOps is

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6800-1
00:35:29.451 --> 00:35:32.757
that they use several tools so
that the integration and

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6800-2
00:35:32.757 --> 00:35:35.473
deployment they all become very
rapid cycles.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6840-0
00:35:35.743 --> 00:35:38.961
So all we are saying is that we
are encouraging saying that in

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6840-1
00:35:38.961 --> 00:35:42.077
the even the data because the
data science projects are very

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6840-2
00:35:42.077 --> 00:35:44.733
intensive and they're critically
dependent on data.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6893-0
00:35:44.743 --> 00:35:48.632
So you may get data sources from
multiple places, so you need to

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6893-1
00:35:48.632 --> 00:35:52.341
have a automation so that the
data OPS will be smooth so they

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6893-2
00:35:52.341 --> 00:35:55.811
when you do the OPS you for
example you are getting a new

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6893-3
00:35:55.811 --> 00:35:58.623
data source that is having a
different format.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6890-0
00:35:56.513 --> 00:35:56.823
There we go.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6913-0
00:35:58.693 --> 00:36:02.707
You need to promptly recognize
that and then make the necessary

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6908-0
00:36:00.363 --> 00:36:00.783
Action.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6913-1
00:36:02.707 --> 00:36:05.153
change and and enable the
integration.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6918-0
00:36:07.173 --> 00:36:07.863
Got it, Sir.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6924-0
00:36:07.913 --> 00:36:08.253
Thank you.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6961-0
00:36:08.713 --> 00:36:13.518
So probably that OPS part we we
used to apply before the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6961-1
00:36:13.518 --> 00:36:18.576
development phase in, in data
science, is it something like

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6955-0
00:36:17.933 --> 00:36:20.283
Uh, see the yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6961-2
00:36:18.576 --> 00:36:20.093
that because like?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6958-0
00:36:20.293 --> 00:36:20.743
Go ahead.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6972-0
00:36:20.753 --> 00:36:22.603
Go ahead, Mr Devendra. Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6993-0
00:36:22.333 --> 00:36:26.669
So OK, just type like like
currently if in without not in

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/6993-1
00:36:26.669 --> 00:36:28.613
the world of data science.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7031-0
00:36:28.623 --> 00:36:32.839
So we used to automate the part
of like continuous deployment

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7031-1
00:36:32.839 --> 00:36:37.123
and the integration along with
certain validations of the code

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7031-2
00:36:37.123 --> 00:36:40.863
and quality what we use to keep
in our day-to-day SDLC

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7031-3
00:36:40.863 --> 00:36:41.543
lifecycle.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7050-0
00:36:41.813 --> 00:36:45.696
So it is like after a
development these are automation

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7050-1
00:36:45.696 --> 00:36:47.743
suites run over the pipeline.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7074-0
00:36:48.033 --> 00:36:51.130
So in the data science field, is
it something like when we want

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7074-1
00:36:51.130 --> 00:36:52.873
to operate something over the
data.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7081-0
00:36:53.353 --> 00:36:55.473
So we went over the source as
well.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7137-0
00:36:55.483 --> 00:36:59.816
We used to apply the pipelines
and we used to like in build up

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7137-1
00:36:59.816 --> 00:37:04.080
the pipeline for the source as
well and after the development

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7137-2
00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:08.000
then we again have that
automation pipeline for the rest

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7137-3
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.333
of the life cycle that we want
to apply over that development.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7145-0
00:37:13.523 --> 00:37:14.823
So is it something like that?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7162-0
00:37:16.203 --> 00:37:19.794
I, through Mr Devendra, I think
that is what I think we are

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7162-1
00:37:19.794 --> 00:37:20.273
talking.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7170-0
00:37:20.443 --> 00:37:21.863
I I'm just.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7172-0
00:37:21.873 --> 00:37:22.913
The house is open.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7243-0
00:37:22.923 --> 00:37:26.166
I mean, somebody wants to bring
in anything, any critical

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7243-1
00:37:26.166 --> 00:37:29.353
observation of the question or
the points that are made,

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7243-2
00:37:29.353 --> 00:37:32.875
because I think they pretty much
the similar thing that we are

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7243-3
00:37:32.875 --> 00:37:36.398
talking about, we are talking
about rapid delivery and that is

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7243-4
00:37:36.398 --> 00:37:39.753
possible through the automation
and we need to identify the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7243-5
00:37:39.753 --> 00:37:43.443
right kind of automation that we
can do in data science pipeline.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7250-0
00:37:44.193 --> 00:37:44.523
I don't know.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7247-0
00:37:44.373 --> 00:37:45.383
So is that.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7251-0
00:37:45.393 --> 00:37:46.123
Is there something that?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7264-0
00:37:48.233 --> 00:37:50.063
I just wanted to validate my.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7281-0
00:37:51.173 --> 00:37:54.323
I I think I think that is what I
think what you need is a.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7278-0
00:37:51.763 --> 00:37:52.443
Understanding.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7290-0
00:37:54.363 --> 00:37:56.563
What you need is consistent with
what we are talking.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7302-0
00:37:56.733 --> 00:37:59.313
So anyone observed any any
variation or anything?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7299-0
00:37:57.343 --> 00:37:57.723
OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7312-0
00:38:00.153 --> 00:38:01.663
OK, so I think we are In Sync.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7325-0
00:38:01.713 --> 00:38:04.623
I think we are In Sync alright,
so So what?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7330-0
00:38:04.033 --> 00:38:04.393
OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7331-0
00:38:04.263 --> 00:38:04.553
Uh.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7333-0
00:38:04.633 --> 00:38:05.963
We yes. Yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7345-0
00:38:05.973 --> 00:38:07.193
Mr Devendra, you want to say
something.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7347-0
00:38:07.953 --> 00:38:08.983
No, no, nothing.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7363-0
00:38:08.993 --> 00:38:09.793
So thank you.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7356-0
00:38:09.033 --> 00:38:09.603
OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7367-0
00:38:09.793 --> 00:38:10.403
OK, sorry.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7360-0
00:38:09.803 --> 00:38:10.863
No, I have a question here.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7396-0
00:38:10.913 --> 00:38:13.588
So you're talking about the
patterns, right or or really

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7396-1
00:38:13.588 --> 00:38:16.310
calling the different patterns
as a model or is something

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7396-2
00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:17.953
models so different with
patterns?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7399-0
00:38:19.043 --> 00:38:20.203
And now we are.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7412-0
00:38:20.243 --> 00:38:23.833
We are really talking about see,
see the finally.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7418-0
00:38:23.843 --> 00:38:28.253
The point is, when we say the
pattern.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7437-0
00:38:30.033 --> 00:38:33.223
So I think you may be present in
the previous session.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7468-0
00:38:33.233 --> 00:38:37.244
We have found one pattern saying
that the the young people are

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7468-1
00:38:37.244 --> 00:38:41.447
likely to buy a particular color
and elderly people are likely to

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7468-2
00:38:41.447 --> 00:38:43.803
buy a different color of car,
right?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7477-0
00:38:46.363 --> 00:38:46.813
Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7501-0
00:38:46.693 --> 00:38:48.743
Mr Mr captain, what are you
dating?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7481-0
00:38:46.873 --> 00:38:48.003
Blue and Gray.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7491-0
00:38:48.013 --> 00:38:48.823
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7495-0
00:38:48.833 --> 00:38:49.453
Blue and green?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7513-0
00:38:49.463 --> 00:38:50.373
Yeah, I I recall that.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7505-0
00:38:50.173 --> 00:38:50.453
Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7507-0
00:38:50.463 --> 00:38:50.633
Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7515-0
00:38:50.643 --> 00:38:52.043
You, you, you would you got
that.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7531-0
00:38:52.053 --> 00:38:55.383
OK, so now now what do you think
it is called as?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7544-0
00:38:55.393 --> 00:38:57.603
Do you think it is a pattern or
it is a?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7577-0
00:38:57.673 --> 00:39:01.436
See, the model is more
formalized term, but the pattern

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7577-1
00:39:01.436 --> 00:39:05.468
is what you are likely to use
this right in in a day to day

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7577-2
00:39:05.468 --> 00:39:07.753
world in day-to-day
conversation.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7623-0
00:39:07.763 --> 00:39:11.287
I think you will rather say that
there is a pattern that you you

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7599-0
00:39:10.303 --> 00:39:10.883
Pat and yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7623-1
00:39:11.287 --> 00:39:14.811
can you can say that OK the the
the factory workers tend to vote

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7623-2
00:39:14.811 --> 00:39:18.227
for a certain political party
and agricultural level work work

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7623-3
00:39:18.227 --> 00:39:19.203
for another party.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7630-0
00:39:19.213 --> 00:39:21.093
So you say that is a pattern,
right?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7661-0
00:39:21.103 --> 00:39:25.736
So and so these are patterns,
but then you can express them as

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7661-1
00:39:25.736 --> 00:39:29.413
a formal way in the form of a
rule or informally.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7664-0
00:39:29.423 --> 00:39:31.333
Some other structures.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7686-0
00:39:31.823 --> 00:39:35.232
Yeah, you will rather call that
as a model so that you

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7686-1
00:39:35.232 --> 00:39:38.393
discovered by running some
algorithms on the data.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7687-0
00:39:38.453 --> 00:39:39.133
God. OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7709-0
00:39:40.903 --> 00:39:45.708
That I have a question in in the
ML OPS context, we are saying

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7701-0
00:39:42.763 --> 00:39:42.943
Yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7709-1
00:39:45.708 --> 00:39:47.233
continuous training.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7719-0
00:39:47.503 --> 00:39:49.923
How do we visualize that what's
happening?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7744-0
00:39:51.113 --> 00:39:54.451
See, The thing is that, uh,
visualizing a continuous is

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7744-1
00:39:54.451 --> 00:39:58.087
always a problem, because there
is nothing like it is really

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7744-2
00:39:58.087 --> 00:39:58.743
continuous.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7756-0
00:39:59.113 --> 00:40:01.063
But then we don't want it
delayed.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7768-0
00:40:01.073 --> 00:40:05.303
So that is that is what the mood
is is more important. So.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7789-0
00:40:05.363 --> 00:40:10.123
So what I see is the they put it
is and in fact some of.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7794-0
00:40:10.173 --> 00:40:11.533
Are you familiar with DevOps?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7801-0
00:40:14.573 --> 00:40:14.973
I am.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7814-0
00:40:15.753 --> 00:40:18.797
You are familiar with, so can
you tell me some tools that are

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7814-1
00:40:18.797 --> 00:40:19.533
used in DevOps?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7831-0
00:40:22.433 --> 00:40:24.763
If you're familiar, if you're
not so familiar, that's also OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7836-0
00:40:25.513 --> 00:40:25.943
So.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7856-0
00:40:30.143 --> 00:40:30.633
Uh.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7869-0
00:40:30.773 --> 00:40:31.433
I'm sorry.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7893-0
00:40:32.353 --> 00:40:35.409
And then some tools which are
meant for doing the version

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7893-1
00:40:35.409 --> 00:40:38.518
control and some tools for
automation building and some so

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7893-2
00:40:38.518 --> 00:40:40.363
something to manage the
container.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7908-0
00:40:40.433 --> 00:40:44.825
See, my point is that So what
are those tools really there

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7908-1
00:40:44.825 --> 00:40:45.123
for?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7944-0
00:40:45.133 --> 00:40:48.106
So whenever they notice a
change, so they essentially tool

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7944-1
00:40:48.106 --> 00:40:50.979
means that will trigger itself
and do something more, or

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7944-2
00:40:50.979 --> 00:40:54.053
otherwise you just do a, trigger
it and then it is going to.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7972-0
00:40:54.153 --> 00:40:57.545
So it is really when people are
talking about this continuous,

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7972-1
00:40:57.545 --> 00:41:00.883
what they're saying is that to
have some automation in place.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7980-0
00:41:01.193 --> 00:41:03.263
So what level of automation is
now?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7989-0
00:41:03.273 --> 00:41:04.943
It is becomes a more
philosophical question.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/7998-0
00:41:04.953 --> 00:41:06.523
So can you say it is continuous
now?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8008-0
00:41:06.533 --> 00:41:08.123
I don't know whether I can say
it is continuous.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8020-0
00:41:10.433 --> 00:41:12.593
But then it is certainly a rapid
cycle.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8028-0
00:41:12.603 --> 00:41:14.043
That is, that all of us agree,
right?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8044-0
00:41:16.123 --> 00:41:18.657
Because there is a difference
between rapid cycle and

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8044-1
00:41:18.657 --> 00:41:19.173
continuous.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8061-0
00:41:19.363 --> 00:41:23.998
So so continuous is if you are
unable to visualize continuous,

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8061-1
00:41:23.998 --> 00:41:24.513
it's a.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8082-0
00:41:24.583 --> 00:41:28.210
It's yes, that is because the
continuous is not really like

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8082-1
00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:31.173
the way health never stops going
around the sun.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8086-0
00:41:31.183 --> 00:41:32.193
No, maybe not.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8100-0
00:41:32.203 --> 00:41:35.671
Maybe not, maybe, but then
something rapid cycle itself is

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8100-1
00:41:35.671 --> 00:41:37.963
moving towards continuous
integration.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8113-0
00:41:39.813 --> 00:41:42.773
Or or whenever there is some
process happens.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8138-0
00:41:42.783 --> 00:41:46.052
So so you create a bad job or
some or some job which gets

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8138-1
00:41:46.052 --> 00:41:49.153
automatically triggered some
some level of automation.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8150-0
00:41:49.873 --> 00:41:51.493
And Mr Santosh army in Singh.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8153-0
00:41:52.263 --> 00:41:53.313
And I thank you, Sir. Yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8168-0
00:41:54.353 --> 00:41:55.283
OK, alright.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8171-0
00:41:54.953 --> 00:41:57.293
And so, yeah, So what exactly
is?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8162-0
00:41:56.133 --> 00:41:56.463
Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8174-0
00:41:56.513 --> 00:41:57.373
I just had a small.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8175-0
00:41:58.393 --> 00:41:58.773
Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8177-0
00:41:58.783 --> 00:41:59.663
What? What?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8190-0
00:41:59.713 --> 00:42:03.183
How would we differentiate that
that OPS and envelopes?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8194-0
00:42:03.193 --> 00:42:04.383
I mean, even in the diagram.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8225-0
00:42:05.603 --> 00:42:09.864
And then figuration seems to be
very tightly in it in that ML

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8225-1
00:42:09.864 --> 00:42:11.033
OPS thing, right?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8217-0
00:42:10.333 --> 00:42:10.813
OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8222-0
00:42:10.823 --> 00:42:11.143
OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8227-0
00:42:11.153 --> 00:42:12.303
Mr Kapil, gargle.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8245-0
00:42:12.313 --> 00:42:15.479
If I repeat your question, what
is the difference really between

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8245-1
00:42:15.479 --> 00:42:16.453
data OPS and ML OPS?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8251-0
00:42:16.503 --> 00:42:17.043
Is that correct?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8256-0
00:42:17.063 --> 00:42:18.163
Yes, yes, yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8300-0
00:42:18.673 --> 00:42:22.111
Yes, so data OPS is only dealing
with the data and ML OPS is also

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8294-0
00:42:20.213 --> 00:42:20.553
No.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8300-1
00:42:22.111 --> 00:42:25.184
dealing with the models for the
simple reason that machine

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8300-2
00:42:25.184 --> 00:42:28.153
learning is all about building
the models from the data.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8301-0
00:42:28.893 --> 00:42:30.063
Yeah, exactly my point.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8316-0
00:42:30.073 --> 00:42:35.173
So even data OPS will end up
providing information results,

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8316-1
00:42:35.173 --> 00:42:35.683
right?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8324-0
00:42:35.693 --> 00:42:37.383
So what machine learning is?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8326-0
00:42:38.203 --> 00:42:38.963
To see.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8360-0
00:42:39.013 --> 00:42:44.972
OK, OK, so now now the question
is that why why K in the data

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8360-1
00:42:44.972 --> 00:42:45.933
OPS it is?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8355-0
00:42:45.163 --> 00:42:46.993
So why these two different
things?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8357-0
00:42:47.003 --> 00:42:47.373
You. Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8364-0
00:42:47.383 --> 00:42:48.623
Why these two different things?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8383-0
00:42:48.633 --> 00:42:50.063
Why and why not this one? Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8407-0
00:42:49.553 --> 00:42:52.815
You know you can see that in
data OPS when they're talking

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8407-1
00:42:52.815 --> 00:42:56.242
about this, they're looking at
many data sources that have to

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8407-2
00:42:56.242 --> 00:42:58.343
pass through the pipeline and
result.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8427-0
00:42:58.453 --> 00:43:02.173
I hope, Mr Kapil, you are able
to see the diagram right.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8421-0
00:43:02.213 --> 00:43:02.513
Yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8424-0
00:43:02.523 --> 00:43:02.913
Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8436-0
00:43:02.923 --> 00:43:03.353
Yes, like.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8434-0
00:43:03.793 --> 00:43:04.543
So this is a.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8445-0
00:43:04.553 --> 00:43:07.744
This is a reasonable diagram to
represent the data pipeline

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8445-1
00:43:07.744 --> 00:43:08.063
right?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8480-0
00:43:08.273 --> 00:43:11.152
Many data sources and which are
trying to reach many

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8480-1
00:43:11.152 --> 00:43:14.629
destinations and then there is
some processing that is going on

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8466-0
00:43:12.003 --> 00:43:12.313
But I.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8480-2
00:43:14.629 --> 00:43:15.933
in between is that fine.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8488-0
00:43:16.873 --> 00:43:17.763
Yep, Yep. Sure.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8497-0
00:43:17.893 --> 00:43:22.743
OK, so now let us go to what
Google offers ads ML pipeline.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8516-0
00:43:23.133 --> 00:43:26.428
So in ML pipeline you can see
that the model training model,

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8516-1
00:43:26.428 --> 00:43:28.373
evaluation model validation,
right?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8522-0
00:43:29.843 --> 00:43:30.183
OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8536-0
00:43:31.413 --> 00:43:34.763
So that is what is making it a
little more than data OPS.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8545-0
00:43:34.773 --> 00:43:35.973
So that is why they're calling.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8554-0
00:43:35.983 --> 00:43:37.633
They may be calling it as mail
OPS.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8581-0
00:43:38.563 --> 00:43:41.780
So to say in some other words,
we say that the consolidated

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8581-1
00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:44.783
information from data OPS is
being consumed in analogs.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8586-0
00:43:45.843 --> 00:43:47.123
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8593-0
00:43:47.133 --> 00:43:48.963
So data OPS is also there.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8611-0
00:43:49.003 --> 00:43:52.869
So The thing is that in ML OPS
the they are thinking in terms

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8611-1
00:43:52.869 --> 00:43:53.493
of models.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8618-0
00:43:53.503 --> 00:43:55.033
They're focus more on models.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8664-0
00:43:55.503 --> 00:43:59.805
So is the model really the
continuous training so that is

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8664-1
00:43:59.805 --> 00:44:04.034
new data is coming and has it
been trained and and maybe

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8664-2
00:44:04.034 --> 00:44:08.559
whatever is the implications
with incorporating the new data

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8664-3
00:44:08.559 --> 00:44:09.523
for training?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8658-0
00:44:10.093 --> 00:44:10.703
OK, OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8662-0
00:44:10.713 --> 00:44:11.073
Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8666-0
00:44:11.083 --> 00:44:11.593
Yeah, got it.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8682-0
00:44:11.603 --> 00:44:15.532
So ML OPS is basically focusing
on the application modeling of

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8682-1
00:44:15.532 --> 00:44:16.093
the data.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8685-0
00:44:17.743 --> 00:44:18.393
That is right.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8711-0
00:44:18.403 --> 00:44:22.462
So finally, the model that is
going to help in the decision

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8702-0
00:44:22.273 --> 00:44:22.573
Thank you.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8711-1
00:44:22.462 --> 00:44:25.913
making or or recognizing the
patterns in the data.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8717-0
00:44:24.623 --> 00:44:24.803
That.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8725-0
00:44:25.923 --> 00:44:27.633
So that is what really they're
talking.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8721-0
00:44:27.913 --> 00:44:28.073
Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8726-0
00:44:28.933 --> 00:44:29.583
So thank you.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8729-0
00:44:29.593 --> 00:44:29.913
Thank you.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8738-0
00:44:31.193 --> 00:44:34.953
Alright, so OK, so we will
proceed.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8769-0
00:44:35.173 --> 00:44:40.593
This is this completes the
discussion on on the processes

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8769-1
00:44:40.593 --> 00:44:46.293
and what we will do is we will
start the discussion on data.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8771-0
00:44:47.243 --> 00:44:48.423
Sorry to interrupt, Sir.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8779-0
00:44:48.503 --> 00:44:49.563
I just shared a small question.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8784-0
00:44:50.413 --> 00:44:50.553
Yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8820-0
00:44:51.183 --> 00:44:54.831
So, uh, so from a software
engineering point of view, we

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8820-1
00:44:54.831 --> 00:44:58.799
are normally make a code change
when we have to basically add

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8820-2
00:44:58.799 --> 00:45:02.383
some new feature or we or we
want to resolve some bugs.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8835-0
00:45:02.803 --> 00:45:05.973
So from an ML OPS point of view,
is there any?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8849-0
00:45:05.983 --> 00:45:10.631
I mean, I mean, how is it
decided that the model needs to

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8849-1
00:45:10.631 --> 00:45:11.673
be retrained?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8860-0
00:45:13.853 --> 00:45:16.403
OK, now let us look at it this
way.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8882-0
00:45:16.693 --> 00:45:25.616
So typically in in model is a
outcome of, uh, of analysis of

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8882-1
00:45:25.616 --> 00:45:26.933
the data.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8900-0
00:45:27.453 --> 00:45:30.640
So you analyze the data
significantly and then you are

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8900-1
00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:32.263
going to out output a model.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8950-0
00:45:32.273 --> 00:45:35.270
So for example, data that we
talked about is a simplest

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8950-1
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:38.535
possible data that we talked
about right at the beginning of

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8950-2
00:45:38.535 --> 00:45:41.799
the classes that I have got, the
age of the customer and the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8950-3
00:45:41.799 --> 00:45:43.833
color of the car that they're
buying.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9026-0
00:45:44.583 --> 00:45:48.563
So now we created a model saying
that OK, so based on this age

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/8961-0
00:45:44.893 --> 00:45:45.193
Great.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9026-1
00:45:48.563 --> 00:45:52.038
cut off, I think that the more
likely I can create a a

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9026-2
00:45:52.038 --> 00:45:55.702
approximate rule with the
reasonable accuracy that if the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9026-3
00:45:55.702 --> 00:45:59.809
person is below 36 years of age,
that person will take a red car

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9026-4
00:45:59.809 --> 00:46:03.473
with him and the person has a
more than 36 of years away.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9036-0
00:46:03.663 --> 00:46:05.173
That person will take a blue car
with you.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9040-0
00:46:05.863 --> 00:46:06.433
So.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9057-0
00:46:06.493 --> 00:46:09.831
So The thing is that there is a
model and then that is based on

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9057-1
00:46:09.831 --> 00:46:10.353
some data.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9071-0
00:46:11.273 --> 00:46:15.163
So now suppose that there is a
data is continuously coming in.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9075-0
00:46:15.513 --> 00:46:16.263
So what will happen?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9083-0
00:46:18.803 --> 00:46:21.513
Umm, we will have more.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9098-0
00:46:21.523 --> 00:46:24.903
I mean, probably the inference
might change later on.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9095-0
00:46:25.553 --> 00:46:26.463
Absolutely.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9103-0
00:46:26.573 --> 00:46:27.863
Is it not right?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9124-0
00:46:27.973 --> 00:46:31.355
So at least if not changes, but
at least we have to be cautious

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9124-1
00:46:31.355 --> 00:46:32.993
that it does not change, right?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9125-0
00:46:34.073 --> 00:46:34.333
Right.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9152-0
00:46:36.973 --> 00:46:40.155
So so there is something that we
need to do with the model,

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9152-1
00:46:40.155 --> 00:46:43.443
because this model has not come
out of really a divine truth.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9173-0
00:46:43.673 --> 00:46:47.580
So we had got some data and then
we have drawn, we discovered a

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9173-1
00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:49.533
pattern from that, nothing more.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9177-0
00:46:53.693 --> 00:46:54.383
OK, OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9203-0
00:46:54.433 --> 00:47:00.392
So, uh, I mean for the new data
that that comes in, we are we do

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9203-1
00:47:00.392 --> 00:47:04.793
not know the the actual
prediction for iterate.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9234-0
00:47:04.833 --> 00:47:08.443
So how do we know that our model
is actually incorrect?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9216-0
00:47:06.793 --> 00:47:07.323
It's me.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9226-0
00:47:07.333 --> 00:47:08.533
See the see the question.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9232-0
00:47:08.543 --> 00:47:09.003
Yeah, yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9243-0
00:47:09.113 --> 00:47:11.783
The question is in and in fact
it's a.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9249-0
00:47:12.133 --> 00:47:13.343
It's an interesting question.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9251-0
00:47:13.353 --> 00:47:14.013
Maybe.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9257-0
00:47:14.273 --> 00:47:15.403
Maybe we can.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9266-0
00:47:15.973 --> 00:47:19.793
We can have a discussion for
again a few minutes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9272-0
00:47:20.723 --> 00:47:21.693
Uh, so.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9306-0
00:47:21.903 --> 00:47:26.492
So the point is, let's say I
think all of us know some real

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9306-1
00:47:26.492 --> 00:47:30.775
problem that banks face for a
long time, which is a non

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9306-2
00:47:30.775 --> 00:47:33.223
performing assets, right, right.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9308-0
00:47:31.713 --> 00:47:31.973
Right.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9313-0
00:47:33.273 --> 00:47:34.423
So what is that?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9325-0
00:47:34.653 --> 00:47:35.923
Is a non performing asset.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9342-0
00:47:36.533 --> 00:47:39.907
I I hope just maybe if you say
maybe I think people will be

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9342-1
00:47:39.907 --> 00:47:40.863
more comfortable.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9354-0
00:47:43.673 --> 00:47:46.293
It's somebody any any person
with some banking knowledge.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9385-0
00:47:48.563 --> 00:47:49.703
Some the money which?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9404-0
00:47:48.893 --> 00:47:51.900
I think it's gonna company takes
a loan but doesn't probably

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9403-0
00:47:49.163 --> 00:47:52.283
It's in that it's not not adding
up to the property.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9404-1
00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:52.393
return it.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9397-0
00:47:53.243 --> 00:47:53.523
OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9413-0
00:47:53.593 --> 00:47:55.333
Yeah, Mr Devendra is trying to
say something.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9416-0
00:47:54.423 --> 00:47:54.633
Maybe.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9418-0
00:47:55.343 --> 00:47:56.253
Just can you give him?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9421-0
00:47:56.293 --> 00:47:56.513
Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9426-0
00:47:56.523 --> 00:47:57.323
Mr Devendra, go ahead.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9469-0
00:47:58.963 --> 00:48:03.911
Or maybe it's something which is
not add up in the profit margin

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9469-1
00:48:03.911 --> 00:48:06.043
that business probably that.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9445-0
00:48:04.413 --> 00:48:04.803
OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9447-0
00:48:04.813 --> 00:48:05.143
OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9449-0
00:48:05.153 --> 00:48:05.443
OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9456-0
00:48:05.453 --> 00:48:05.803
No, no.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9461-0
00:48:05.863 --> 00:48:06.883
Let me put it this way.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9499-0
00:48:06.953 --> 00:48:10.216
So it is generally what they
refer to is that they give a

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9499-1
00:48:10.216 --> 00:48:13.761
loan and then the loan is not
paid in time or the installments

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9499-2
00:48:13.761 --> 00:48:14.943
are not paid in time.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9521-0
00:48:14.953 --> 00:48:17.574
So and there are circuit second
criteria based on which they say

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9521-1
00:48:17.574 --> 00:48:18.743
it is a non performing asset.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9537-0
00:48:19.673 --> 00:48:21.603
So now that means it is a loss
to the bank.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9536-0
00:48:19.853 --> 00:48:21.313
Bad loans, basically.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9569-0
00:48:24.783 --> 00:48:27.983
You know it is a bad loans
didn't, yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9555-0
00:48:25.033 --> 00:48:25.353
Uh.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9577-0
00:48:26.573 --> 00:48:29.595
In bad loans, right that that
is, that is what is mostly the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9577-1
00:48:29.595 --> 00:48:30.983
nonperforming assets, right?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9584-0
00:48:30.903 --> 00:48:31.123
OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9618-0
00:48:31.033 --> 00:48:34.246
OK, so now the question is that
what is the loan approval

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9618-1
00:48:34.246 --> 00:48:37.458
process in the Bank, so Luna
approval process is really a

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9618-2
00:48:37.458 --> 00:48:40.893
classification problem which
they may do it in their own way.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9629-0
00:48:40.903 --> 00:48:43.013
But some of the modern banks I
will not.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9633-0
00:48:43.063 --> 00:48:43.513
Not at all.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9650-0
00:48:43.523 --> 00:48:46.511
Be surprised if they're
significantly dependent on

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9650-1
00:48:46.511 --> 00:48:48.093
seeing it loan application.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9695-0
00:48:48.343 --> 00:48:51.195
They're going to take all the
100 attributes that are there in

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9695-1
00:48:51.195 --> 00:48:54.001
the loan application and then
they're going to feed it to the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9695-2
00:48:54.001 --> 00:48:56.989
machine and then machine is also
going to say, is it likely to be

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9695-3
00:48:56.989 --> 00:48:57.623
repaid or not.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9705-0
00:48:59.123 --> 00:49:03.873
So so now now the question is
the.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9731-0
00:49:04.563 --> 00:49:08.635
So the point is that there is a
model and even before this

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9731-1
00:49:08.635 --> 00:49:13.053
machine learning coming to the
play, what was happening before.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9748-0
00:49:13.533 --> 00:49:16.950
So suppose that machine learning
was not there, so loan approval

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9748-1
00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:17.423
is there.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9755-0
00:49:17.553 --> 00:49:19.003
Suppose it is a large loan.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9789-0
00:49:19.013 --> 00:49:22.715
They will say that we need to
get an approval from a senior

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9789-1
00:49:22.715 --> 00:49:26.664
manager if it is a 10,000 loan,
they may say that OK, the lower

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9789-2
00:49:26.664 --> 00:49:28.453
level executive can grant it.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9804-0
00:49:29.533 --> 00:49:32.123
So what is really the situation
that's happening?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9809-0
00:49:33.493 --> 00:49:33.973
The risk.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9817-0
00:49:35.313 --> 00:49:36.983
Yeah, the risk is a element.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9823-0
00:49:35.953 --> 00:49:36.093
And.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9841-0
00:49:37.033 --> 00:49:40.269
But then what they are saying is
that the IT is possible that the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9841-1
00:49:40.269 --> 00:49:42.133
senior manager has a better
judgment.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9844-0
00:49:43.353 --> 00:49:43.863
Do you agree?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9854-0
00:49:47.803 --> 00:49:48.023
Yep.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9855-0
00:49:47.923 --> 00:49:48.103
Yep.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9878-0
00:49:48.003 --> 00:49:51.548
The consequence is risk, but
then they are saying that it is

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9878-1
00:49:51.548 --> 00:49:54.976
senior manager because possibly
they think he knows the IT

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9878-2
00:49:54.976 --> 00:49:55.383
better.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9885-0
00:49:56.223 --> 00:49:57.123
Do you agree or you don't?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9890-0
00:49:58.803 --> 00:49:58.923
Yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9898-0
00:49:59.343 --> 00:50:00.023
Yes, yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9895-0
00:50:00.503 --> 00:50:01.213
Well, we agreed.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9900-0
00:50:01.223 --> 00:50:02.073
OK, very good.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9914-0
00:50:02.143 --> 00:50:06.133
OK, so now now what is the basis
for that person's judgment?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9923-0
00:50:08.013 --> 00:50:08.763
Experience.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9925-0
00:50:09.473 --> 00:50:10.503
Absolutely right.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9932-0
00:50:09.553 --> 00:50:10.103
He would speak.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9931-0
00:50:09.663 --> 00:50:10.213
What cases?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9927-0
00:50:10.733 --> 00:50:10.983
Right.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9935-0
00:50:10.993 --> 00:50:12.403
Mr Souder, it is experience.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9940-0
00:50:12.523 --> 00:50:13.633
But what is experience?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9942-0
00:50:15.663 --> 00:50:15.893
Uh.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9953-0
00:50:17.663 --> 00:50:18.483
Puristic data.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9951-0
00:50:18.113 --> 00:50:18.743
Processing.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9968-0
00:50:19.213 --> 00:50:22.523
Processing similar situation
many times in different context.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/9970-0
00:50:22.373 --> 00:50:24.263
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10019-0
00:50:24.373 --> 00:50:28.378
So the point is that the senior
manager has already given 10,000

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10019-1
00:50:28.378 --> 00:50:32.382
loans and knows that out of them
9500 are doing fine and 500 are

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10019-2
00:50:32.382 --> 00:50:36.079
not doing fine and possibly
thought about why those 500 are

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10019-3
00:50:36.079 --> 00:50:37.373
not doing fine right?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10038-0
00:50:38.143 --> 00:50:38.903
Do you agree or not?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10030-0
00:50:38.563 --> 00:50:38.783
Are you?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10044-0
00:50:39.623 --> 00:50:42.693
It's an experience based on the
huge amount of historical data.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10048-0
00:50:43.863 --> 00:50:44.603
Agreed, right.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10061-0
00:50:44.643 --> 00:50:46.843
So that is what I think I was
trying to put the numbers.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10065-0
00:50:46.853 --> 00:50:47.433
Yeah, absolutely.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10074-0
00:50:47.443 --> 00:50:48.433
You're right, Mr Praneel.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10077-0
00:50:48.963 --> 00:50:50.893
Right, right.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10099-0
00:50:50.943 --> 00:50:56.073
So everybody's In Sync that the
the and now, now let us say what

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10099-1
00:50:56.073 --> 00:50:57.573
is that experience?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10112-0
00:50:57.583 --> 00:51:00.635
So when there are thousand,
10,000 times, he has sanctioned

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10112-1
00:51:00.635 --> 00:51:01.093
the loan.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10126-0
00:51:01.423 --> 00:51:04.723
So that means that that person
has processed 10,000 records, is

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10126-1
00:51:04.723 --> 00:51:05.393
that correct?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10145-0
00:51:08.963 --> 00:51:09.803
Is that correct or not?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10153-0
00:51:09.083 --> 00:51:10.913
Right, yes, right.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10139-0
00:51:09.383 --> 00:51:09.523
Yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10152-0
00:51:10.233 --> 00:51:10.773
Yes, yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10147-0
00:51:10.483 --> 00:51:11.453
10,000 records.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10196-0
00:51:11.513 --> 00:51:14.973
So instead of that person
running through his brain in

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10196-1
00:51:14.973 --> 00:51:18.433
algorithm based on the 10,000
records, can we write an

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10196-2
00:51:18.433 --> 00:51:22.334
algorithm that will take these
10,000 records and is going to

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10196-3
00:51:22.334 --> 00:51:24.913
create a model that is going to
be used?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10202-0
00:51:25.203 --> 00:51:25.843
Is it possible?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10215-0
00:51:27.073 --> 00:51:27.933
Yes, yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10214-0
00:51:27.243 --> 00:51:27.933
Yes, yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10223-0
00:51:28.173 --> 00:51:30.203
At least data scientists should
think that it should be

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10223-1
00:51:30.203 --> 00:51:30.783
possible, right?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10228-0
00:51:30.793 --> 00:51:32.293
Is it not so?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10256-0
00:51:32.103 --> 00:51:36.814
With, with, with some caution
because we are saying intuition

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10246-0
00:51:32.353 --> 00:51:35.183
Otherwise we are in trouble yet.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10256-1
00:51:36.814 --> 00:51:39.093
is equal to 100% in algorithm.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10262-0
00:51:39.283 --> 00:51:40.413
No, no, just, no, no.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10270-0
00:51:39.623 --> 00:51:39.923
Is it?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10280-0
00:51:40.423 --> 00:51:43.170
Then in that case, Mr Santosh,
let me let me put one thing

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10280-1
00:51:43.170 --> 00:51:43.403
back.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10285-0
00:51:43.803 --> 00:51:44.363
So.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10381-0
00:51:44.423 --> 00:51:48.075
So in that case, why is it that
when the same manager who has

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10381-1
00:51:48.075 --> 00:51:51.786
given 100 loans and is getting
repaid, then another five loans

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10381-2
00:51:51.786 --> 00:51:55.496
that manager has given and they
failed because previously also

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10381-3
00:51:55.496 --> 00:51:59.030
they were when the NPS were
there, it is not that they were

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10381-4
00:51:59.030 --> 00:52:02.447
not doing due diligence they
were doing due diligence and

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10381-5
00:52:02.447 --> 00:52:06.334
still some of the loans were cut
becoming NPS and even today some

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10381-6
00:52:06.334 --> 00:52:10.222
loans are becoming NPS maybe the
percentage you know the reissues

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10379-0
00:52:09.103 --> 00:52:09.333
Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10381-7
00:52:10.222 --> 00:52:11.223
can be different.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10390-0
00:52:11.513 --> 00:52:12.513
So what can be the region?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10414-0
00:52:12.343 --> 00:52:15.903
Yeah, humans cannot be come and
now.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10407-0
00:52:15.713 --> 00:52:16.613
No, no, it is it.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10425-0
00:52:16.623 --> 00:52:18.645
The problem is it with the
humans and the problem is with

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10425-1
00:52:18.645 --> 00:52:19.063
the machine.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10440-0
00:52:19.073 --> 00:52:22.303
Also, the machine also cannot
predict you with 100% accuracy.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10435-0
00:52:19.933 --> 00:52:20.103
It's.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10452-0
00:52:23.073 --> 00:52:25.473
And humans also don't have that
perfect judgment.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10450-0
00:52:24.243 --> 00:52:24.683
Parameters.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10453-0
00:52:24.843 --> 00:52:25.583
Thank you very much.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10471-0
00:52:28.023 --> 00:52:30.023
Maybe some of the parameters
it's it's.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10468-0
00:52:28.223 --> 00:52:28.923
The outliers.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10478-0
00:52:32.203 --> 00:52:33.573
Mr Manoj, rest in.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10485-0
00:52:33.583 --> 00:52:34.733
You need to be clear.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10492-0
00:52:34.743 --> 00:52:36.053
I think you are trying to say
something.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10508-0
00:52:36.063 --> 00:52:37.403
I'm not able to understand can
you repeat?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10505-0
00:52:37.423 --> 00:52:38.013
Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10520-0
00:52:38.423 --> 00:52:41.213
So the parameters and the
weightage for that parameter.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10545-0
00:52:41.223 --> 00:52:44.909
For example, like if he's taking
home loan, whether he's buying

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10545-1
00:52:44.909 --> 00:52:47.443
an city area or village area
kind of right.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10572-0
00:52:48.723 --> 00:52:51.802
Mr Mr Sebastian, my question
will be that do you think that

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10572-1
00:52:51.802 --> 00:52:54.984
the bank appointed as a senior
loan general manager, somebody

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10572-2
00:52:54.984 --> 00:52:56.113
who doesn't know that?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10585-0
00:52:59.983 --> 00:53:03.520
We basically we cannot remember
everything from our past, right,

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10585-1
00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:03.683
so.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10606-0
00:53:05.753 --> 00:53:08.665
Going through each and every
parameters again, it is a time

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10606-1
00:53:08.665 --> 00:53:09.393
taking process.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10609-0
00:53:09.913 --> 00:53:11.783
So so now, now. OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10614-0
00:53:11.793 --> 00:53:12.173
OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10627-0
00:53:12.183 --> 00:53:15.785
Then in that case, do we have a
solution or we only have a

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10627-1
00:53:15.785 --> 00:53:16.273
problem?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10648-0
00:53:19.943 --> 00:53:24.326
We have a solution but with
certain degree of and tolerance

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10644-0
00:53:24.263 --> 00:53:24.643
OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10648-1
00:53:24.326 --> 00:53:25.203
for failure.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10646-0
00:53:25.883 --> 00:53:26.233
Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10649-0
00:53:26.243 --> 00:53:26.483
Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10653-0
00:53:26.493 --> 00:53:27.913
OK, OK alright.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10662-0
00:53:27.963 --> 00:53:28.923
So I think we are there.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10672-0
00:53:28.983 --> 00:53:31.573
I think I think what you said is
reasonable.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10732-0
00:53:31.683 --> 00:53:36.142
So whether you go for humans or
whether you go for machine, in

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10732-1
00:53:36.142 --> 00:53:40.531
fact, in both these cases there
is something machine has some

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10732-2
00:53:40.531 --> 00:53:45.203
superiority in the sense that it
will have a no no letter Z or no

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10732-3
00:53:45.203 --> 00:53:49.733
possibility of being biased or
in some sense bias can be there.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10763-0
00:53:49.743 --> 00:53:53.583
Actually, we will talk about
that sometime later, but then

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10763-1
00:53:53.583 --> 00:53:57.814
some level of you know what how
the machine behaves and you also

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10763-2
00:53:57.814 --> 00:54:00.353
know how the human intelligence
works.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10776-0
00:54:00.843 --> 00:54:03.213
So in both these cases, there is
no perfection.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10784-0
00:54:03.223 --> 00:54:05.733
But then but then yes, we try.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10789-0
00:54:05.803 --> 00:54:06.773
We try to use.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10792-0
00:54:06.783 --> 00:54:08.803
Both are.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10798-0
00:54:08.813 --> 00:54:10.733
We are we.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10823-0
00:54:10.743 --> 00:54:13.733
I think what we started with
about the models and

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10823-1
00:54:13.733 --> 00:54:16.603
approximations is that all clear
or now we are.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10835-0
00:54:16.673 --> 00:54:19.643
We are saying that we may not
have a perfect model.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10851-0
00:54:19.753 --> 00:54:22.346
Even yesterday, we did not
possibly have perfect model, and

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10851-1
00:54:22.346 --> 00:54:23.643
even tomorrow we may not have.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10861-0
00:54:24.273 --> 00:54:27.803
So are we fine with that or
still some doubts?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10890-0
00:54:32.613 --> 00:54:36.729
OK, so our intent is most
probably to improve, but then it

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10890-1
00:54:36.729 --> 00:54:41.195
doesn't mean that the what more
whatever model that existed was

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10890-2
00:54:41.195 --> 00:54:41.753
perfect.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10912-0
00:54:41.763 --> 00:54:45.995
And so in that sense, the
process is about continuously

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10912-1
00:54:45.995 --> 00:54:49.773
keep looking at evaluating it
and how continuous.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10936-0
00:54:49.783 --> 00:54:53.060
Again, I I leave that word aside
because continuous again, you

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10936-1
00:54:53.060 --> 00:54:56.181
start questioning many things
and really there isn't answer

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10936-2
00:54:56.181 --> 00:54:57.013
really anywhere.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10965-0
00:54:57.023 --> 00:54:59.877
Even in the DevOps, I don't
think it is what they say is a

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10965-1
00:54:59.877 --> 00:55:02.442
continuous in the sense that
nonstop it is something

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10965-2
00:55:02.442 --> 00:55:03.603
something close to that.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10972-0
00:55:08.083 --> 00:55:08.573
Alright.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10989-0
00:55:08.583 --> 00:55:12.753
So we'll proceed further and
maybe I think we are, we are

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/10989-1
00:55:12.753 --> 00:55:13.903
almost one hour.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11006-0
00:55:13.913 --> 00:55:18.292
So do we take 5 minute break now
and then we'll start discussion

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11006-1
00:55:18.292 --> 00:55:19.303
about the data.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11007-0
00:55:20.723 --> 00:55:20.983
Yes, Sir.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11131-0
00:59:54.943 --> 00:59:56.343
OK, let's get restarted.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11151-0
00:59:57.943 --> 01:00:04.081
And what we do is that we
discuss about aspects of data,

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11151-1
01:00:04.081 --> 01:00:04.943
alright.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11189-0
01:00:05.593 --> 01:00:09.847
So one of the things is that
when we you may be working many

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11189-1
01:00:09.847 --> 01:00:13.752
of you may be working with
databases umm which is which

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11189-2
01:00:13.752 --> 01:00:16.333
most of the business data is
stored.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11199-0
01:00:16.743 --> 01:00:19.313
So you would have heard about
the data types.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11215-0
01:00:19.883 --> 01:00:23.493
So what is the data type that
you look at such as integer?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11229-0
01:00:26.083 --> 01:00:29.613
Float and then with a specific
accuracy.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11243-0
01:00:30.423 --> 01:00:35.591
So with the number of decimal
places and then you may be

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11243-1
01:00:35.591 --> 01:00:37.223
having the Webcat.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11267-0
01:00:39.603 --> 01:00:44.139
And possibly BLOB or you may be
having various data types that

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11267-1
01:00:44.139 --> 01:00:47.811
if the database supports
different databases, have

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11267-2
01:00:47.811 --> 01:00:49.323
different data types.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11277-0
01:00:49.653 --> 01:00:51.813
So what is the intent of all
this?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11287-0
01:00:52.033 --> 01:00:57.453
So these are really talking
about size and interpretation.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11299-0
01:01:00.543 --> 01:01:02.763
This is really a metadata about
the data.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11315-0
01:01:02.913 --> 01:01:06.656
So what we are saying is that
when we are getting so much of

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11315-1
01:01:06.656 --> 01:01:06.963
data.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11325-0
01:01:11.543 --> 01:01:14.373
Which is all continuous sequence
of bits.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11350-0
01:01:14.883 --> 01:01:19.950
We need an ability to identify
saying that, OK, this part is

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11350-1
01:01:19.950 --> 01:01:25.184
representing the uh, something
it is representing possibly the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11350-2
01:01:25.184 --> 01:01:26.513
the designation.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11369-0
01:01:27.133 --> 01:01:32.698
So which may be a flag with the
certain values that need to be

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11369-1
01:01:32.698 --> 01:01:32.963
so.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11383-0
01:01:33.013 --> 01:01:37.943
So the point is we need a way to
interpret the data.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11413-0
01:01:37.953 --> 01:01:42.617
So for that reason, databases
typically have the database data

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11413-1
01:01:42.617 --> 01:01:47.280
types, and then based on that
the size is decided and then the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11413-2
01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:48.983
contents are extracted.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11446-0
01:01:49.723 --> 01:01:54.571
So now when it comes to the data
science dance, it was little

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11446-1
01:01:54.571 --> 01:01:59.420
differently because we are not
so much concerned about really

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11446-2
01:01:59.420 --> 01:01:59.733
the.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11460-0
01:02:00.213 --> 01:02:03.243
Of course, we need to read the
data, so we need to know that.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11482-0
01:02:03.763 --> 01:02:07.503
But then in a data science task,
it is not really the integer and

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11482-1
01:02:07.503 --> 01:02:09.883
float that is going to make a
difference.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11499-0
01:02:11.743 --> 01:02:15.314
Because when we are trying to
find a patterns that are within

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11499-1
01:02:15.314 --> 01:02:15.833
the data.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11512-0
01:02:16.103 --> 01:02:19.503
So what is really making a
difference to us?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11516-0
01:02:20.473 --> 01:02:22.963
Eat certain characteristics.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11544-0
01:02:23.273 --> 01:02:29.417
So for example, when we say it
is a, the one of the data types

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11544-1
01:02:29.417 --> 01:02:33.123
that we are going to come into
is so.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11574-0
01:02:33.223 --> 01:02:36.615
So the way in which we can make
a comparison so one of the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11574-1
01:02:36.615 --> 01:02:40.123
things that we need to be able
to do is that how we compare.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11594-0
01:02:40.193 --> 01:02:43.167
So it is possible that the float
and integer will have the same

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11594-1
01:02:43.167 --> 01:02:44.143
method of comparison.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11611-0
01:02:44.593 --> 01:02:47.086
So we are not really so much
concerned whether it's a float

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11611-1
01:02:47.086 --> 01:02:47.543
or integer.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11630-0
01:02:47.553 --> 01:02:50.551
So that is important when
somebody is managing the storage

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11630-1
01:02:50.551 --> 01:02:53.143
of the data, but not for the
data science process.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11658-0
01:02:54.083 --> 01:03:00.059
So we are talking about looking
at the data and from a certain

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11658-1
01:03:00.059 --> 01:03:06.034
perspective which enables us to
discover the patterns or build

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11658-2
01:03:06.034 --> 01:03:06.983
the model.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11671-0
01:03:07.323 --> 01:03:10.043
So now let us see how do we look
at the data.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11689-0
01:03:10.053 --> 01:03:14.010
So here I think it requests no
explanation, so these are the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11689-1
01:03:14.010 --> 01:03:14.853
data objects.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11763-0
01:03:14.863 --> 01:03:18.966
You can take them as records if
you want or you call them as

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11763-1
01:03:18.966 --> 01:03:23.137
data objects or data tuples or
instances or whatever you want

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11763-2
01:03:23.137 --> 01:03:26.836
to call this, and then each one
is having the multiple

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11763-3
01:03:26.836 --> 01:03:30.873
attributes and each of the
attributes has set him value and

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11763-4
01:03:30.873 --> 01:03:34.370
then we can have certain
attribute which is like an

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11763-5
01:03:34.370 --> 01:03:38.003
example is an eye color of a
person or a temperature.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11785-0
01:03:38.073 --> 01:03:46.133
So we know that that value value
can have in meaning and then

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11785-1
01:03:46.133 --> 01:03:48.733
that meaning can be.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11803-0
01:03:48.743 --> 01:03:52.876
For example, when you are trying
to aggregate so many times, many

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11803-1
01:03:52.876 --> 01:03:54.003
to do aggregation.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11822-0
01:03:54.233 --> 01:03:57.685
So different attributes have
different types of aggregations

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11822-1
01:03:57.685 --> 01:03:59.723
that we can think of doing on
that.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11855-0
01:03:59.733 --> 01:04:03.621
So that is one way in which we
can differentiate the world,

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11855-1
01:04:03.621 --> 01:04:07.703
differentiate that attributes
and the other way is the type of

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11855-2
01:04:07.703 --> 01:04:10.943
operations that are possible on
these attributes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11861-0
01:04:10.953 --> 01:04:12.473
So that can be another way.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11878-0
01:04:12.853 --> 01:04:17.896
So we will, we will rather look
at attributes as four types

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11878-1
01:04:17.896 --> 01:04:19.913
based on these criteria.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11888-0
01:04:23.893 --> 01:04:26.313
And they are like this.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11898-0
01:04:26.413 --> 01:04:30.323
So data first, we divide it into
numerical and categorical.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11912-0
01:04:30.393 --> 01:04:34.563
So now you can see that what is
happening to my where cache.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11926-0
01:04:38.013 --> 01:04:41.753
So the VAD care if it is for
storing an address.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11936-0
01:04:47.943 --> 01:04:50.213
Of of let's say 100 characters.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11971-0
01:04:54.443 --> 01:04:58.161
It is very unlikely that 100
characters you provide and you

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11971-1
01:04:58.161 --> 01:05:02.003
give a free flowing freedom to
people to write the address in

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11971-2
01:05:02.003 --> 01:05:02.933
different ways.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11980-0
01:05:03.223 --> 01:05:04.723
Somebody starts with house
number.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/11988-0
01:05:04.733 --> 01:05:06.573
Sometimes somebody starts with
street names.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12012-0
01:05:06.583 --> 01:05:10.080
Somebody starts with the city
name so, but then whatever name

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12012-1
01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:13.633
that you give it is possible to
interpret by some human actor.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12027-0
01:05:14.153 --> 01:05:19.725
So it is unlikely that such data
will be useful for any data

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12027-1
01:05:19.725 --> 01:05:20.913
science task.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12046-0
01:05:23.153 --> 01:05:27.418
And coming back just to see any
questions, OK, there are some

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12046-1
01:05:27.418 --> 01:05:28.313
raised hands.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12070-0
01:05:29.463 --> 01:05:33.017
I do not know whether that is
for anything to do with the what

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12070-1
01:05:33.017 --> 01:05:35.613
we are talking now, uh, or this
is something.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12101-0
01:05:37.313 --> 01:05:41.585
So if we are having a varchar
just for storing some

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12101-1
01:05:41.585 --> 01:05:46.844
descriptive elements, we may not
be able to use any of that for

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12101-2
01:05:46.844 --> 01:05:49.473
our data science model building.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12108-0
01:05:51.083 --> 01:05:52.473
I hope we are In Sync.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12133-0
01:05:54.363 --> 01:05:58.553
Alright, let me enable the
enable the MIC for you people so

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12133-1
01:05:58.553 --> 01:06:02.603
that I'll become even more
confident that we are In Sync.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12164-0
01:06:18.023 --> 01:06:22.901
Alright, so now what we are
saying is that so for data

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12164-1
01:06:22.901 --> 01:06:27.513
science purposes, the our own
processes processing.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12200-0
01:06:27.983 --> 01:06:32.160
So we would define the data,
divide the data into 2 broad

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12200-1
01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:36.768
categories, one is a numerical
data that can be floating point,

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12200-2
01:06:36.768 --> 01:06:40.153
or it is a integer short integer
long integer.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12226-0
01:06:40.163 --> 01:06:45.791
It is a sometimes can be other
types that many of the systems

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12226-1
01:06:45.791 --> 01:06:49.603
support and the other one is
categorical.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12247-0
01:06:50.053 --> 01:06:53.968
So categorical can be expressed
in many ways, so it can be

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12247-1
01:06:53.968 --> 01:06:56.423
expressed in the form of some
codes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12279-0
01:06:56.493 --> 01:07:01.329
Whatever be the code so it can
be like many times, you can see

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12279-1
01:07:01.329 --> 01:07:06.011
that two letter state code is
used for car registration or a

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12279-2
01:07:06.011 --> 01:07:07.393
bike registration.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12317-0
01:07:08.263 --> 01:07:12.504
So it is possibly that can be
one because that uh, that gives

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12317-1
01:07:12.504 --> 01:07:16.745
a standardization and then when
vehicle moves from Interstate

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12317-2
01:07:16.745 --> 01:07:20.986
traffic, so it is comfortable
for the staff to work with such

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12317-3
01:07:20.986 --> 01:07:21.533
numbers.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12330-0
01:07:22.083 --> 01:07:24.473
So it can be any type of
categorical.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12341-0
01:07:24.483 --> 01:07:29.073
So the point is that so
categorical is indicating this.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12387-0
01:07:29.083 --> 01:07:32.839
So even G ZIP codes is
categorical, so it is possible

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12387-1
01:07:32.839 --> 01:07:36.943
that I think in India we may be
having up to 1,000,000 PIN

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12387-2
01:07:36.943 --> 01:07:41.116
codes, but we will still call
them as category because they

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12387-3
01:07:41.116 --> 01:07:43.203
are 1,000,000 distinct values.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12390-0
01:07:43.213 --> 01:07:44.313
Nothing more, nothing less.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12403-0
01:07:45.453 --> 01:07:49.203
So the number doesn't matter but
distinct values.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12415-0
01:07:49.633 --> 01:07:53.383
That makes it nominal so, but
that is not numerical.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12425-0
01:07:53.393 --> 01:07:55.653
I hope that is comfortable with
everybody.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12447-0
01:07:55.663 --> 01:08:01.078
So PIN code is not numerical
even though it is a number, but

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12432-0
01:07:56.573 --> 01:07:56.843
Aye.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12447-1
01:08:01.078 --> 01:08:02.853
it is a categorical.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12463-0
01:08:04.713 --> 01:08:06.163
I was about to ask that, Sir.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12461-0
01:08:05.173 --> 01:08:06.543
Numerical values.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12491-0
01:08:06.553 --> 01:08:12.759
We look at it for any bling, the
computations, the computations

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12491-1
01:08:12.759 --> 01:08:18.966
can be of the two forms mood of
all operations or or plus minus

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12491-2
01:08:18.966 --> 01:08:20.033
operations.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12501-0
01:08:20.043 --> 01:08:25.293
So if it permits only only
differencing.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12515-0
01:08:26.553 --> 01:08:29.423
Then only we can look at the
difference.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12531-0
01:08:30.933 --> 01:08:35.756
Then it is interval so we can
look at both the difference and

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12531-1
01:08:35.756 --> 01:08:36.223
ratio.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12541-0
01:08:37.403 --> 01:08:40.143
It is ratio type, so we'll look
at examples.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12561-0
01:08:40.153 --> 01:08:45.435
So I hope that will be clarified
so so you can look at the types

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12561-1
01:08:45.435 --> 01:08:46.573
of attributes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12569-0
01:08:46.843 --> 01:08:48.293
So possibly this helps.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12567-0
01:08:48.813 --> 01:08:49.563
Yeah, sorry.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12589-0
01:08:49.573 --> 01:08:53.595
Yeah, sorry said to interrupt
like in the address of any human

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12589-1
01:08:53.595 --> 01:08:55.063
having a mobile number.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12619-0
01:08:55.333 --> 01:08:58.270
It is also falls under the
category will not in the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12619-1
01:08:58.270 --> 01:09:01.659
numerical because we are not
going to perform any numerical

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12619-2
01:09:01.659 --> 01:09:02.393
accent there.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12617-0
01:09:02.163 --> 01:09:02.813
Absolutely.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12621-0
01:09:02.823 --> 01:09:03.853
Absolutely right.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12624-0
01:09:04.083 --> 01:09:04.613
Absolutely.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12629-0
01:09:04.663 --> 01:09:05.193
Numerical.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12694-0
01:09:05.263 --> 01:09:09.753
The mobile number itself can be
categorical because mobile

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12694-1
01:09:09.753 --> 01:09:14.701
number can serve as a key value
in certain certain databases and

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12659-0
01:09:13.883 --> 01:09:14.103
And.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12694-2
01:09:14.701 --> 01:09:19.420
so and we cannot think in terms
of, we cannot say that mobile

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12694-3
01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:23.834
number, let's say it is a 2
digit code 94 is closer to 93

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12694-4
01:09:23.834 --> 01:09:24.443
then 36.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12712-0
01:09:24.513 --> 01:09:28.444
It doesn't work like so mobile
number is independent and it is

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12703-0
01:09:24.783 --> 01:09:26.353
Exactly right.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12712-1
01:09:28.444 --> 01:09:29.193
a key value.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12720-0
01:09:29.203 --> 01:09:30.003
Absolutely you're right.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12760-0
01:09:30.783 --> 01:09:33.916
The numerical data in the
address I don't think is there,

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12760-1
01:09:33.916 --> 01:09:37.482
but if the human if I talk about
a person like height like weight

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12760-2
01:09:37.482 --> 01:09:39.643
and these things will come as a
number.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12758-0
01:09:40.473 --> 01:09:40.943
Absolutely.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12774-0
01:09:40.953 --> 01:09:43.343
They are numbers and they we can
compare the differences.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12792-0
01:09:43.353 --> 01:09:46.443
Also, we can say that one person
is 2 inches taller than that.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12824-0
01:09:46.453 --> 01:09:50.542
That makes some that gives us
something, so possibly we can we

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12803-0
01:09:46.523 --> 01:09:47.573
So all of that, yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12824-1
01:09:50.542 --> 01:09:53.593
may be able to use it for some
purpose, right?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12820-0
01:09:54.453 --> 01:09:54.733
OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12825-0
01:09:54.743 --> 01:09:55.233
Thank you, Sir.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12866-0
01:09:58.973 --> 01:10:04.065
So I'm not questioning this, so
we have an ordinal and nominal

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12851-0
01:10:03.973 --> 01:10:04.253
Right.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12866-1
01:10:04.065 --> 01:10:09.156
route, so grades and shirt size
and color, so somewhat similar

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12866-2
01:10:09.156 --> 01:10:09.803
to each.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12878-0
01:10:09.813 --> 01:10:13.610
Say for example in short, size
and color are always similar

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12878-1
01:10:13.610 --> 01:10:14.623
characteristics.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12886-0
01:10:14.633 --> 01:10:16.363
How come it comes under
ordinary?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12902-0
01:10:16.933 --> 01:10:18.453
I mean, how do we categorize
this?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12897-0
01:10:18.873 --> 01:10:19.403
No, no.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12923-0
01:10:19.413 --> 01:10:23.862
If you say it is a color of a
cloth color of a cloth cannot be

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12923-1
01:10:23.862 --> 01:10:26.263
ordinary, it has to be a
nominal.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12948-0
01:10:26.813 --> 01:10:29.576
It is just a you have a
categorical values, people call

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12948-1
01:10:29.576 --> 01:10:32.783
them as categorical variables or
sometimes as nominal variables.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12984-0
01:10:33.233 --> 01:10:36.888
But then when you say the size,
it is ordinal because what you

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12984-1
01:10:36.888 --> 01:10:40.659
know is that if a small size is
not fitting, the people will say

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12984-2
01:10:40.659 --> 01:10:42.283
go for next which is medium.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/12994-0
01:10:42.713 --> 01:10:46.553
Or if the next is large, then
extra large.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13008-0
01:10:46.593 --> 01:10:50.201
So the point is that there is a
there is a ranking associated

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13008-1
01:10:50.201 --> 01:10:50.783
with that.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13014-0
01:10:53.223 --> 01:10:53.503
OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13016-0
01:10:53.303 --> 01:10:53.693
Are you fine?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13017-0
01:10:54.233 --> 01:10:55.363
Yes. OK. Thank

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13063-0
01:11:01.103 --> 01:11:05.268
So I hope these examples are
clear enough to indicate when we

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13063-1
01:11:05.268 --> 01:11:09.567
call them as nominal, ordinal,
interval or issues and these are

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13063-2
01:11:09.567 --> 01:11:13.127
more for the purpose of
understanding because we are

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13063-3
01:11:13.127 --> 01:11:16.553
trying to analyze the data and
discover a pattern.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13120-0
01:11:16.923 --> 01:11:20.509
So we need to know what are the
types of operations that we can

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13120-1
01:11:20.509 --> 01:11:23.758
perform and what are the
sensible operations and what are

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13120-2
01:11:23.758 --> 01:11:27.008
the nonsense I mean, because
even just because two people

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13120-3
01:11:27.008 --> 01:11:30.426
have your mobile number that
differs by only one, it doesn't

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13120-4
01:11:30.426 --> 01:11:32.163
mean anything because it's not.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13128-0
01:11:32.173 --> 01:11:34.283
So it has to be treated in a
different way.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13180-0
01:11:34.573 --> 01:11:38.017
But then if two people have a
have a income which is differing

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13180-1
01:11:38.017 --> 01:11:41.406
by only small amount, then maybe
you will club them into same

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13180-2
01:11:41.406 --> 01:11:44.796
group saying that both of them
are likely to buy a product or

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13180-3
01:11:44.796 --> 01:11:46.873
likely to buy likely to do
something.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13202-0
01:11:47.713 --> 01:11:51.044
Some mother in some other terms
where the income matters, so

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13202-1
01:11:51.044 --> 01:11:53.283
they can be plugged into the
same group.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13222-0
01:11:53.333 --> 01:11:58.078
So in that sense, the values
matter in some cases and and the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13222-1
01:11:58.078 --> 01:12:01.293
matter in a different way in
other cases.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13240-0
01:12:05.053 --> 01:12:08.722
Here are some more examples, so
I hope it clarifies him even

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13240-1
01:12:08.722 --> 01:12:09.143
better.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13260-0
01:12:09.573 --> 01:12:13.503
And at this point, let us keep
the operations aside, though you

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13260-1
01:12:13.503 --> 01:12:16.143
may be able to understand some
operations.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13285-0
01:12:16.153 --> 01:12:20.167
So I don't want to go into the
computation of entropy, and so

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13285-1
01:12:20.167 --> 01:12:22.563
we will come to that as we go
along.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13289-0
01:12:22.573 --> 01:12:23.163
So.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13300-0
01:12:23.873 --> 01:12:31.203
So I hope the the examples and
the descriptions are clear.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13315-0
01:12:33.873 --> 01:12:37.023
Some of them you will anyway
know what is a geometric mean.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13322-0
01:12:37.033 --> 01:12:38.283
What is a harmonic mean?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13328-0
01:12:38.293 --> 01:12:39.023
What is a?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13342-0
01:12:39.513 --> 01:12:43.373
You mean some of you may know
mean and mode, median and mode.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13346-0
01:12:44.203 --> 01:12:45.533
Uh, so.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13361-0
01:12:45.583 --> 01:12:50.856
So if you want uh, the standard
deviation and mean, I'm sure

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13361-1
01:12:50.856 --> 01:12:51.893
people will.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13367-0
01:12:52.163 --> 01:12:54.403
People maybe knowing so.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13402-0
01:12:54.473 --> 01:12:59.441
So what we are saying is the the
type of attributes decide what

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13402-1
01:12:59.441 --> 01:13:03.943
is it that we can do so that
decides what is the type of?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13413-0
01:13:05.233 --> 01:13:08.063
What is the contribution that
this attribute can do to them?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13431-0
01:13:13.713 --> 01:13:20.222
Another way to look at the
attributes is discrete or

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13431-1
01:13:20.222 --> 01:13:21.573
continuous.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13485-0
01:13:21.863 --> 01:13:26.531
So essentially the continuous is
the ones which are having

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13485-1
01:13:26.531 --> 01:13:30.804
represented by floating point
and get discrete can be

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13485-2
01:13:30.804 --> 01:13:35.789
represented either by a integer
number saying that for example

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13485-3
01:13:35.789 --> 01:13:40.853
you are going to say tall is 1
and short is a medium is too and

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13485-4
01:13:40.853 --> 01:13:41.723
short is 3.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13514-0
01:13:41.733 --> 01:13:45.825
That can be a numerical
representation, but discrete is

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13514-1
01:13:45.825 --> 01:13:50.210
a limited possible values, and
the binary is a very special

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13514-2
01:13:50.210 --> 01:13:51.453
case of discrete.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13519-0
01:13:52.693 --> 01:13:55.163
We only two possible values can
exist.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13542-0
01:13:57.253 --> 01:14:00.551
And there is another type of
attribute which we want to

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13542-1
01:14:00.551 --> 01:14:02.553
consider as asymmetric
attribute.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13567-0
01:14:03.463 --> 01:14:08.797
So Assymmetric attributes or,
uh, interesting in the sense

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13567-1
01:14:08.797 --> 01:14:13.589
that only non 0 value the two
values are not equally

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13567-2
01:14:13.589 --> 01:14:14.493
important.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13583-0
01:14:16.973 --> 01:14:21.733
So asymmetric variables it can
take two possible values.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13593-0
01:14:22.903 --> 01:14:25.443
Only one of the value is
important.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13598-0
01:14:25.583 --> 01:14:27.093
Other value is unimportant.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13618-0
01:14:27.183 --> 01:14:32.281
So for example, let us say a
doctor is examining the patients

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13618-1
01:14:32.281 --> 01:14:35.323
and what the doctor did is to
order.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13621-0
01:14:39.493 --> 01:14:40.423
Ordered.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13646-0
01:14:42.353 --> 01:14:47.456
The 12T100 hundred diagnostic
tests, because something, let's

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13646-1
01:14:47.456 --> 01:14:50.913
assume they they are the same
for people.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13665-0
01:14:51.653 --> 01:14:55.813
So what is the expectation when
you are performing these hundred

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13665-1
01:14:55.813 --> 01:14:58.053
diagnostic tests, so most of
them?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13674-0
01:15:01.163 --> 01:15:04.683
Will be yen loaded with EN.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13681-0
01:15:06.003 --> 01:15:07.833
So suppose there is some.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13684-0
01:15:07.843 --> 01:15:08.903
Why some way?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13697-0
01:15:11.533 --> 01:15:15.433
That is going to become very
significant.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13716-0
01:15:15.823 --> 01:15:19.887
So in fact, the doctor is only
interested because expects that

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13716-1
01:15:19.887 --> 01:15:21.823
people in general are healthy.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13736-0
01:15:22.683 --> 01:15:26.805
So if there is a, there is a
symptom that is expressed

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13736-1
01:15:26.805 --> 01:15:28.903
through the diagnostic test.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13755-0
01:15:29.993 --> 01:15:32.414
Then they need to do the
diagnosis for that and the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13755-1
01:15:32.414 --> 01:15:34.043
possibly find the suitable
remedy.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13761-0
01:15:35.223 --> 01:15:36.623
So in such cases.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13796-0
01:15:38.903 --> 01:15:43.347
You can see some more examples,
but then this is I thought this

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13796-1
01:15:43.347 --> 01:15:47.653
is a stronger example so that
will tell that the attribute is

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13796-2
01:15:47.653 --> 01:15:50.153
asymmetric because no has no
value.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13821-0
01:15:52.343 --> 01:15:56.328
And it is the yes, which
differentiates, for example

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13821-1
01:15:56.328 --> 01:16:00.613
patient one and patient two when
they're comparing them.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13867-0
01:16:00.663 --> 01:16:04.575
It's essentially most of them
are known, so you can say that

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13867-1
01:16:04.575 --> 01:16:08.551
they have 90% similarity, so we
ignore all the nodes that are

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13867-2
01:16:08.551 --> 01:16:12.142
common to both and we only
consider wherever the why is

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13867-3
01:16:12.142 --> 01:16:14.323
existing for one of the
patients.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13888-0
01:16:14.333 --> 01:16:17.748
Then we say that these two
patients are different to the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13888-1
01:16:17.748 --> 01:16:20.924
sextant, so that is the
characteristic of asymmetric

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13888-2
01:16:20.924 --> 01:16:21.583
attributes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13899-0
01:16:24.233 --> 01:16:26.283
So here is an example I think.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13931-0
01:16:26.553 --> 01:16:30.779
I think it it should be a very
simple example, so I'm also

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13931-1
01:16:30.779 --> 01:16:34.933
giving away the answer so you
can see that the attributes

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13931-2
01:16:34.933 --> 01:16:37.583
which are nominal ratio and
ordinal.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13951-0
01:16:45.273 --> 01:16:48.939
So one thing which is missing
here is the time stamp where

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13951-1
01:16:48.939 --> 01:16:49.933
we'll keep that.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13983-0
01:16:52.063 --> 01:16:54.983
The time stamp is generally
considered as an interval

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13983-1
01:16:54.983 --> 01:16:58.228
because only thing that matters
with respect to time is the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13983-2
01:16:58.228 --> 01:16:59.743
difference between the time.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/13993-0
01:17:00.363 --> 01:17:02.933
You cannot think of dividing the
time and do anything.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14004-0
01:17:06.693 --> 01:17:08.243
Sir, how ID is nominal.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14010-0
01:17:08.253 --> 01:17:08.983
When can you explain?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14039-0
01:17:09.783 --> 01:17:12.857
Because there are only few
distinct values and you cannot

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14039-1
01:17:12.857 --> 01:17:15.932
think of business because it is
numeric, you don't do the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14039-2
01:17:15.932 --> 01:17:18.423
subtraction or addition or
anything like that.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14060-0
01:17:18.513 --> 01:17:21.427
You don't say that the
difference between first record

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14060-1
01:17:21.427 --> 01:17:24.023
and 2nd record is only one it it
makes no sense.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14073-0
01:17:24.463 --> 01:17:27.780
So you have to treat that as
each is an individual value,

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14073-1
01:17:27.780 --> 01:17:28.123
right?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14092-0
01:17:30.893 --> 01:17:33.405
It is pretty much like one of
your colleagues talked about the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14092-1
01:17:33.405 --> 01:17:33.963
mobile number.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14121-0
01:17:33.973 --> 01:17:37.112
So mobile number because we are
not supposed to do additions and

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14121-1
01:17:37.112 --> 01:17:40.202
subtractions on those numbers,
we just need to treat them as an

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14121-2
01:17:40.202 --> 01:17:41.313
individual identifiers.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14161-0
01:17:42.903 --> 01:17:47.268
So can we categorize like if it
is in something which identifies

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14161-1
01:17:47.268 --> 01:17:50.223
individuality, that's a nominal,
that's OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14144-0
01:17:48.973 --> 01:17:49.263
Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14148-0
01:17:49.273 --> 01:17:50.063
Yes, something.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14155-0
01:17:50.073 --> 01:17:50.263
Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14201-0
01:17:50.273 --> 01:17:53.488
Nominally, something which is,
it is sometimes even the color

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14201-1
01:17:53.488 --> 01:17:56.859
of a person is also a color of a
cloth is also a nominal because

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14201-2
01:17:56.859 --> 01:17:59.971
it can have a few distinct
values, and similarly profession

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14201-3
01:17:59.971 --> 01:18:01.423
of a person is also nominal.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14209-0
01:18:01.433 --> 01:18:02.213
Yeah, there are.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14242-0
01:18:02.533 --> 01:18:06.563
There are several things which
are nominal where you do not

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14242-1
01:18:06.563 --> 01:18:10.727
have a opportunity to make a
comparison and you have to treat

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14242-2
01:18:10.727 --> 01:18:12.473
them as a distinct values.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14268-0
01:18:12.483 --> 01:18:15.679
So it need not be completely
identifying value but example

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14268-1
01:18:15.679 --> 01:18:18.063
you may have two mobile phones
and may not.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14282-0
01:18:18.073 --> 01:18:21.083
That may not be the key field,
but still it is a.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14291-0
01:18:21.093 --> 01:18:22.563
It is going to be a nominal.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14307-0
01:18:22.613 --> 01:18:25.508
Similarly, Egypt Code will be
nominal, even though it may not

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14306-0
01:18:25.233 --> 01:18:25.443
Umm.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14307-1
01:18:25.508 --> 01:18:27.003
be identifying anybody anything.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14310-0
01:18:28.893 --> 01:18:29.133
OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14328-0
01:18:29.963 --> 01:18:32.487
An ordinary, something that
represents this property of

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14328-1
01:18:32.487 --> 01:18:32.713
that.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14335-0
01:18:33.583 --> 01:18:35.153
The way there is a grading.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14375-0
01:18:35.163 --> 01:18:37.621
So for example, in one
organization there is a

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14342-0
01:18:35.663 --> 01:18:36.063
Grading.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14375-1
01:18:37.621 --> 01:18:40.498
designation which is a ranking
saying that you join as

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14375-2
01:18:40.498 --> 01:18:43.636
assistant engineer, then you
become engineer, then a senior

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14375-3
01:18:43.636 --> 01:18:46.513
engineer, junior manager, senior
manager and all that.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14387-0
01:18:46.563 --> 01:18:49.493
So you know that there is a
sequence, so it is.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14445-0
01:18:49.583 --> 01:18:53.636
So you know that manager and
senior manager are far closer in

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14445-1
01:18:53.636 --> 01:18:57.493
their experience or whatever
compared to senior manager in

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14445-2
01:18:57.493 --> 01:19:01.481
distant so that you call that as
an ordinal variable because

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14445-3
01:19:01.481 --> 01:19:05.404
there is a differentiation order
order both all of them are

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14445-4
01:19:05.404 --> 01:19:06.973
nominal in their values.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14456-0
01:19:07.413 --> 01:19:10.843
But then there is a ranking with
respect to those values.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14465-0
01:19:12.463 --> 01:19:15.143
So how can gender be nominal,
Sir?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14468-0
01:19:15.703 --> 01:19:16.143
We can't.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14477-0
01:19:16.153 --> 01:19:18.453
We can use it to do some
analysis, right?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14488-0
01:19:18.463 --> 01:19:19.533
So how can it be nominal?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14493-0
01:19:20.473 --> 01:19:21.893
No, what else it can it can be.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14504-0
01:19:24.033 --> 01:19:25.343
What else do you think it will?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14507-0
01:19:25.353 --> 01:19:25.863
It will be.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14520-0
01:19:26.153 --> 01:19:29.483
I'm sorry if the point is that
it is a.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14541-0
01:19:29.533 --> 01:19:32.633
See, we are not saying that it
is just differentiating one of

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14541-1
01:19:32.633 --> 01:19:34.083
the attributes of the people.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14543-0
01:19:34.093 --> 01:19:34.463
Is it known?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14568-0
01:19:36.443 --> 01:19:39.625
It is just one attribute of the
person, or what else it can be,

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14568-1
01:19:39.625 --> 01:19:39.973
I mean.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14576-0
01:19:40.143 --> 01:19:42.013
Then age can also be nominal,
right?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14573-0
01:19:42.843 --> 01:19:43.373
No, no.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14627-0
01:19:43.383 --> 01:19:46.352
Yeah, age is the The thing is
that you can say that the person

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14627-1
01:19:46.352 --> 01:19:49.227
with ten years experience is
having double the experience of

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14627-2
01:19:49.227 --> 01:19:52.054
the person with five years
experience or the person with 50

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14627-3
01:19:52.054 --> 01:19:54.787
years Live it for double the
time that 25 year old person

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14627-4
01:19:54.787 --> 01:19:55.683
lived on the earth.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14639-0
01:19:57.523 --> 01:19:59.843
So there is also a ratio that
you can do, right?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14648-0
01:20:07.453 --> 01:20:08.803
No, I don't think I'm following
this.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14665-0
01:20:12.073 --> 01:20:13.513
So why should I?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14662-0
01:20:12.683 --> 01:20:14.293
So maybe they're the ratio.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14682-0
01:20:14.403 --> 01:20:18.166
Gender can also be defined,
maybe, or she might be referring

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14682-1
01:20:18.166 --> 01:20:19.153
to that by like.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14720-0
01:20:19.163 --> 01:20:22.451
We can say this number these
many number of mails with

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14690-0
01:20:19.493 --> 01:20:19.703
Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14720-1
01:20:22.451 --> 01:20:24.783
respect to these number first
females.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14705-0
01:20:22.893 --> 01:20:23.513
No, no, no, no.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14715-0
01:20:23.523 --> 01:20:24.903
We are not talking about that.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14724-0
01:20:24.913 --> 01:20:27.213
I aggregates we are talking
about individual records.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14732-0
01:20:27.983 --> 01:20:28.283
OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14747-0
01:20:28.083 --> 01:20:31.023
We are talking about individual
records and record values and

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14747-1
01:20:31.023 --> 01:20:32.683
what you can do with those
values.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14768-0
01:20:33.763 --> 01:20:38.167
So in case of things like age or
height, we are saying that they

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14768-1
01:20:38.167 --> 01:20:39.793
also have an element of.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14777-0
01:20:39.903 --> 01:20:42.173
We can make a comparison though
height.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14805-0
01:20:42.183 --> 01:20:45.553
You can say how you can divide
and all that place, but you can

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14805-1
01:20:45.553 --> 01:20:48.815
there is something like we can
say this is twice the long as

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14805-2
01:20:48.815 --> 01:20:49.083
that.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14812-0
01:20:49.513 --> 01:20:50.813
So humans, we don't do.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14821-0
01:20:50.983 --> 01:20:52.913
But then suppose we are
measuring some bar.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14836-0
01:20:52.923 --> 01:20:56.115
We can say that someone bar is
twice the length of the other.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14836-1
01:20:56.115 --> 01:20:56.733
Another bar.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14845-0
01:20:57.453 --> 01:20:57.943
Oh yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14849-0
01:20:58.273 --> 01:21:00.363
Is that still uncomfortable?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14853-0
01:21:00.373 --> 01:21:00.973
Some for someone.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14876-0
01:21:06.793 --> 01:21:10.061
I don't know who was there
talking about the age and

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14876-1
01:21:10.061 --> 01:21:10.493
gender.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14889-0
01:21:11.523 --> 01:21:12.903
Well, like.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14885-0
01:21:12.253 --> 01:21:13.783
Yeah, I was talking when I just
need to.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14899-0
01:21:14.113 --> 01:21:16.513
I'll redo through the video once
again.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14900-0
01:21:17.643 --> 01:21:18.173
OK, OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14905-0
01:21:18.283 --> 01:21:19.113
No problem.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14920-0
01:21:19.123 --> 01:21:23.653
So so yeah, this because Yage
allows us to do computations.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14926-0
01:21:23.993 --> 01:21:25.753
So so the computations.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14954-0
01:21:25.763 --> 01:21:29.382
So you agree that it is at least
interval right, Mr Shamshad you

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14956-0
01:21:29.273 --> 01:21:30.313
Yeah, yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14954-1
01:21:29.382 --> 01:21:31.443
agree that at least it has
interval?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14984-0
01:21:31.633 --> 01:21:35.784
It is numeric and it allows you
to do some calculations and but

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14977-0
01:21:35.733 --> 01:21:35.873
Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14984-1
01:21:35.784 --> 01:21:38.703
in gender you can only do an
identification.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/14992-0
01:21:38.763 --> 01:21:42.243
Either it is male or female,
nothing more, right?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15006-0
01:21:42.693 --> 01:21:44.823
So it is like pretty much like a
color.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15017-0
01:21:44.833 --> 01:21:47.203
You can identify the color of
the car is black or red.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15071-0
01:21:47.213 --> 01:21:51.054
You cannot do anything else with
that, but do you agree with that

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15041-0
01:21:50.833 --> 01:21:50.963
Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15071-1
01:21:51.054 --> 01:21:54.489
or do you still it is still
discomforting, so so the point

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15071-2
01:21:54.489 --> 01:21:58.330
is and then with the age you can
do the computations and then the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15071-3
01:21:58.330 --> 01:21:58.563
age.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15100-0
01:21:59.333 --> 01:22:02.866
We are saying that it is ratio
because we can also think in

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15100-1
01:22:02.866 --> 01:22:06.399
terms of double and triple and
possibly but then in general

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15100-2
01:22:06.399 --> 01:22:07.753
maybe we don't do that.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15140-0
01:22:08.333 --> 01:22:12.987
But this also permits because it
starts with a G08A newborn has

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15140-1
01:22:12.987 --> 01:22:17.277
age of 0 and then it goes all
the way and then we can do a

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15140-2
01:22:17.277 --> 01:22:18.513
ratio if we wish.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15151-0
01:22:20.143 --> 01:22:22.353
But with respect to time, you
cannot do a ratio.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15160-0
01:22:22.363 --> 01:22:25.103
So you can you have to stick to
interval.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15168-0
01:22:27.003 --> 01:22:28.753
Is this still some discomfort?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15175-0
01:22:28.763 --> 01:22:30.533
Some one person raised hand.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15185-0
01:22:30.543 --> 01:22:32.463
I don't know whether for this
one or something else.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15199-0
01:22:35.663 --> 01:22:36.823
One person has reason.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15209-0
01:22:36.093 --> 01:22:39.975
With everything thing that
labels are record right would be

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15209-1
01:22:39.975 --> 01:22:40.493
nominal.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15215-0
01:22:41.513 --> 01:22:43.133
Labels are nominal always right?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15219-0
01:22:43.143 --> 01:22:44.743
That is correct, yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15246-0
01:22:46.973 --> 01:22:49.724
To male or female labels are
record, so it would be nominal

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15241-0
01:22:49.613 --> 01:22:50.003
No, no.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15246-1
01:22:49.724 --> 01:22:50.183
basically.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15256-0
01:22:50.013 --> 01:22:54.963
Male and female are not labels
because these are see yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15269-0
01:22:54.973 --> 01:22:58.823
So in that sense, yeah, it is
giving a characteristic.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15282-0
01:22:58.833 --> 01:23:01.423
So it is a kind of yeah, you can
possibly say.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15297-0
01:23:01.533 --> 01:23:04.468
So you are saying that yes, so
that word is they are becoming

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15297-1
01:23:04.468 --> 01:23:05.083
nominal, yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15330-0
01:23:10.053 --> 01:23:12.848
I don't know whether people will
agree if they say that you're

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15330-1
01:23:12.848 --> 01:23:15.421
labeling someone as a male or
female, so that's why I I I

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15330-2
01:23:15.421 --> 01:23:16.663
don't want to get into that.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15368-0
01:23:16.673 --> 01:23:19.898
But you you be what we are
saying is that it is a

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15365-0
01:23:17.863 --> 01:23:20.993
Yeah, you can send the data in
the.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15368-1
01:23:19.898 --> 01:23:23.123
characteristic that we can
simply say yes, it is.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15413-0
01:23:23.133 --> 01:23:26.367
It takes 2 possible values, but
we do cannot perform any

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15413-1
01:23:26.367 --> 01:23:29.829
operations like ordinal saying
that one is let one level and

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15413-2
01:23:29.829 --> 01:23:33.007
other is that we cannot do and
we cannot do any numeric

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15413-3
01:23:33.007 --> 01:23:34.823
operations so it is coming into.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15428-0
01:23:37.583 --> 01:23:39.243
And hope everybody's
comfortable.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15450-0
01:23:38.273 --> 01:23:42.080
So liquidly the relation to one
record and for that one record

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15450-1
01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:45.403
what it is it in that's going to
determine what it is?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15452-0
01:23:45.473 --> 01:23:45.683
What?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15454-0
01:23:45.693 --> 01:23:45.903
What?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15461-0
01:23:46.013 --> 01:23:47.123
What kind of attribute it?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15484-0
01:23:48.543 --> 01:23:52.053
Hi, Mr Rajesh, are you answering
is there a question I'm little.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15499-0
01:23:52.283 --> 01:23:54.653
No, no, there's no question is
this trying to somehow?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15493-0
01:23:54.563 --> 01:23:54.933
You OK?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15497-0
01:23:54.943 --> 01:23:56.033
You're trying to explain.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15501-0
01:23:56.083 --> 01:23:56.593
OK. OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15504-0
01:23:56.603 --> 01:23:56.993
Thank you.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15507-0
01:23:57.003 --> 01:23:57.433
Thank you.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15510-0
01:23:57.443 --> 01:23:57.773
OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15520-0
01:23:57.783 --> 01:23:58.683
So we'll proceed further.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15517-0
01:23:59.373 --> 01:24:00.003
Uh, I said.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15542-0
01:24:00.013 --> 01:24:03.440
Just want to little
clarification like we can divide

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15542-1
01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:04.863
the two groups of the.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15594-0
01:24:04.873 --> 01:24:08.996
If I divide in the two groups of
male or female, then we can

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15594-1
01:24:08.996 --> 01:24:13.255
decide that which either female
get the perform better because

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15594-2
01:24:13.255 --> 01:24:17.648
the great maybe that all of the
girls are passed female past but

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15594-3
01:24:17.648 --> 01:24:19.203
not all the male paths.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15593-0
01:24:17.853 --> 01:24:17.993
Yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15618-0
01:24:19.213 --> 01:24:23.554
So we can here we do the
operations like group of females

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15618-1
01:24:23.554 --> 01:24:26.323
having performed better than a
male.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15631-0
01:24:26.513 --> 01:24:30.013
So this type of performance can
be NBA young.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15635-0
01:24:30.023 --> 01:24:31.733
You're set operation.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15647-0
01:24:31.743 --> 01:24:34.763
We can perform had something.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15648-0
01:24:34.573 --> 01:24:35.883
See Mr Vishal.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15670-0
01:24:35.933 --> 01:24:39.500
Mr Vishal, you can perform many
operations so, but then yes, so

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15670-1
01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:42.343
suddenly that can be one
possibility, for example.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15698-0
01:24:42.453 --> 01:24:45.684
So in the job selection or in
the university ranking something

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15698-1
01:24:45.684 --> 01:24:48.813
here you can always analyze and
you can say that there is a.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15726-0
01:24:49.073 --> 01:24:52.648
Based on this, you can also say
something more like for example

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15726-1
01:24:52.648 --> 01:24:55.888
people who are coming with
certain background in or doing

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15726-2
01:24:55.888 --> 01:24:57.173
better than the others.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15741-0
01:24:57.183 --> 01:24:59.643
So it is becoming another
attribute just like gender.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15775-0
01:25:00.133 --> 01:25:03.795
So you're saying that, OK,
people who are coming with a

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15749-0
01:25:00.423 --> 01:25:00.703
Hope.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15775-1
01:25:03.795 --> 01:25:07.916
this type of job description not
doing better or people coming

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15775-2
01:25:07.916 --> 01:25:10.663
with this type of degree or
doing better.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15788-0
01:25:10.723 --> 01:25:13.743
So there can be many parameters
based on which you can analyze.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15785-0
01:25:11.103 --> 01:25:11.323
But.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15819-0
01:25:13.753 --> 01:25:16.794
So all of them are racially the
same way we are putting them in

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15819-1
01:25:16.794 --> 01:25:19.598
the same way I think you are
just giving one more example,

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15819-2
01:25:19.598 --> 01:25:19.883
right?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15822-0
01:25:20.343 --> 01:25:20.503
Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15825-0
01:25:21.773 --> 01:25:22.563
OK, alright.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15827-0
01:25:23.583 --> 01:25:23.993
Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15830-0
01:25:24.003 --> 01:25:24.393
OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15834-0
01:25:24.403 --> 01:25:25.303
So we'll proceed further.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15863-0
01:25:28.513 --> 01:25:32.072
So I think this example is done
and then we can also look at

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15863-1
01:25:32.072 --> 01:25:34.523
discrete and continuous in a
similar way.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15892-0
01:25:34.673 --> 01:25:38.146
You can see that the age is
continuous and then grade is a

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15892-1
01:25:38.146 --> 01:25:41.678
discrete, but then ordinal and
then similarly percentage of

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15892-2
01:25:41.678 --> 01:25:44.563
marks is continuous and all
others are discrete.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15904-0
01:25:45.813 --> 01:25:49.503
So now, now we will look at
types of data sets.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15916-0
01:25:49.513 --> 01:25:51.383
Not much to talk about with
this.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15924-0
01:25:51.393 --> 01:25:53.763
We did discuss about this in the
last class.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15958-0
01:25:54.093 --> 01:25:58.054
So so we are just elaborating a
little further saying that the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15958-1
01:25:58.054 --> 01:26:01.952
data type can be structured or
unstructured, but sometimes we

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15958-2
01:26:01.952 --> 01:26:05.473
can have something in between
which is semi structured.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15970-0
01:26:05.903 --> 01:26:09.985
We can also have something
called a quasi structured, so

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15970-1
01:26:09.985 --> 01:26:10.773
structured.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15987-0
01:26:10.823 --> 01:26:15.331
I think it requires no big
explanation and this is referred

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15987-1
01:26:15.331 --> 01:26:16.383
to very often.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/15990-0
01:26:16.393 --> 01:26:18.653
The relational RDBMS data.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16015-0
01:26:18.963 --> 01:26:23.920
So you typically have sometimes
what is known as a master data

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16015-1
01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:28.719
or which changes very little, or
you can have it transaction

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16015-2
01:26:28.719 --> 01:26:29.113
data.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16136-0
01:26:30.763 --> 01:26:33.971
So which is which refers to
master data and also

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16136-1
01:26:33.971 --> 01:26:37.703
incorporates the recent events
and keeps getting flushed

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16136-2
01:26:37.703 --> 01:26:41.631
knowing then so so that is
referring to the structured data

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16136-3
01:26:41.631 --> 01:26:45.559
semi structured data is typical
JSON Data where or XML data

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16136-4
01:26:45.559 --> 01:26:49.618
where you have a label and data
and then we are talking about

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16136-5
01:26:49.618 --> 01:26:53.677
the quasi structured data is
some people put this some people

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16136-6
01:26:53.677 --> 01:26:57.801
bring in some authors bring in
So what we are talking about is

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16136-7
01:26:57.801 --> 01:27:01.664
a textual data which can have
erratic formats which we get

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16136-8
01:27:01.664 --> 01:27:05.854
from different and then we need
to put in some effort to put it

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16136-9
01:27:05.854 --> 01:27:09.193
into some structure so and then
unstructured data.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16145-0
01:27:09.583 --> 01:27:13.623
These are data with bit no
inherent structure.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16168-0
01:27:16.173 --> 01:27:19.902
So so this this nomenclature is
again, possibly different

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16168-1
01:27:19.902 --> 01:27:23.503
authors tend to use a slightly
different nomenclatures.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16194-0
01:27:23.813 --> 01:27:28.028
So what is well known is
structured, unstructured and

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16194-1
01:27:28.028 --> 01:27:32.790
then semi structured for a long
time the convention has been

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16194-2
01:27:32.790 --> 01:27:34.273
SSML XML and Jason.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16218-0
01:27:40.583 --> 01:27:45.047
Alright, so we will look at
there are many sources of data

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16218-1
01:27:45.047 --> 01:27:48.073
sets and these are just a few
examples.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16228-0
01:27:48.083 --> 01:27:49.913
But then you find many, many
sources.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16289-0
01:27:49.923 --> 01:27:53.267
In fact, there are many
governments which are posting

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16289-1
01:27:53.267 --> 01:27:57.045
their data and and encouraging
their citizens to analyze the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16289-2
01:27:57.045 --> 01:28:00.699
data, and this is a classic
source which is the University

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16289-3
01:28:00.699 --> 01:28:04.106
of California at Irvine for a
long time they have been

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16289-4
01:28:04.106 --> 01:28:08.070
collecting and posting the data
and for a long time people have

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16289-5
01:28:08.070 --> 01:28:10.733
been using this for learning
data science.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16297-0
01:28:17.883 --> 01:28:19.743
And they have.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16329-0
01:28:19.853 --> 01:28:23.590
They have a huge datasets that
and they also classify saying

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16329-1
01:28:23.590 --> 01:28:27.326
that this data set is good for
learning unsupervised machine

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16329-2
01:28:27.326 --> 01:28:29.103
learning or clustering or so.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16344-0
01:28:29.113 --> 01:28:33.215
Various types of purposes for
which you can use that data set

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16344-1
01:28:33.215 --> 01:28:33.943
and Kaggle.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16354-0
01:28:34.093 --> 01:28:37.263
You may all have heard, and that
is they.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16430-0
01:28:37.273 --> 01:28:41.522
There is a mini data scientists
come together to share knowledge

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16430-1
01:28:41.522 --> 01:28:45.641
and organize competitions kind
of things, and then Canada is 1

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16430-2
01:28:45.641 --> 01:28:49.890
it one which seems to have a lot
of data that they share and but

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16430-3
01:28:49.890 --> 01:28:53.682
then there are many other
countries also with share a lot

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16430-4
01:28:53.682 --> 01:28:57.473
of data that they have which
people can use for for their

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16430-5
01:28:57.473 --> 01:29:00.873
analysis and but then there are
many other sources.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16463-0
01:29:00.883 --> 01:29:05.155
These are just a, just some
limited examples and then there

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16463-1
01:29:05.155 --> 01:29:09.428
can be private data where there
are several constraints are

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16463-2
01:29:09.428 --> 01:29:13.273
there with respect to using them
for public analysis.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16475-0
01:29:17.103 --> 01:29:20.613
Then record data we have already
seen.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16481-0
01:29:20.883 --> 01:29:23.533
What is the record data then?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16490-0
01:29:23.543 --> 01:29:25.613
We are talking about data
metrics.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16528-0
01:29:25.983 --> 01:29:31.318
Data matrix is we are typically
talking about number of rows and

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16528-1
01:29:31.318 --> 01:29:36.242
the number of columns and in
fact it's the same data can be

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16528-2
01:29:36.242 --> 01:29:39.443
expressed in a in a a
homogeneous way.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16540-0
01:29:39.773 --> 01:29:42.163
So so that is why we call it.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16566-0
01:29:42.173 --> 01:29:46.036
So in fact, typically people
call the data matrix when

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16566-1
01:29:46.036 --> 01:29:50.391
they're all numbers, so that is
the tendency to for people to

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16566-2
01:29:50.391 --> 01:29:50.813
refer.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16591-0
01:29:50.823 --> 01:29:55.001
But then this is again another
term because you can as well

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16591-1
01:29:55.001 --> 01:29:58.343
call this as Yum Records, then a
document data.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16599-0
01:29:58.353 --> 01:29:59.603
So this is a tricky thing.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16607-0
01:29:59.913 --> 01:30:02.103
So how to represent a document?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16619-0
01:30:02.773 --> 01:30:05.259
So first question, we need to
answer is how to represent it

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16619-1
01:30:05.259 --> 01:30:05.383
on.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16625-0
01:30:11.333 --> 01:30:12.033
In the files.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16636-0
01:30:14.093 --> 01:30:16.263
In a file, no, no, no.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16639-0
01:30:16.273 --> 01:30:18.433
File is a file.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16652-0
01:30:18.443 --> 01:30:21.043
Maybe you are saying how you
store the data, right?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16654-0
01:30:21.923 --> 01:30:23.023
Most likely a Jason.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16667-0
01:30:25.313 --> 01:30:27.183
In the form of a Jason, you are
saying.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16671-0
01:30:27.233 --> 01:30:28.343
OK, OK, see.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16680-0
01:30:28.353 --> 01:30:30.553
But the Jason's purpose is
Jason.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16710-0
01:30:30.563 --> 01:30:34.716
When you say, suppose that this
is representing some speech

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16710-1
01:30:34.716 --> 01:30:38.176
Moody has given in a Prime,
Minister has given on

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16710-2
01:30:38.176 --> 01:30:41.983
Independence Day so that you can
get it as a document.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16728-0
01:30:42.243 --> 01:30:45.006
So now you are saying that you
will represent that in a JSON

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16728-1
01:30:45.006 --> 01:30:45.323
better.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16733-0
01:30:45.453 --> 01:30:46.323
I don't think so.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16735-0
01:30:46.393 --> 01:30:46.963
Does it?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16743-0
01:30:47.153 --> 01:30:48.763
Is there any point that you want
to make?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16759-0
01:30:51.493 --> 01:30:53.233
And Mr Manoj, would you say
something?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16751-0
01:30:51.863 --> 01:30:52.173
Of.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16760-0
01:30:54.393 --> 01:30:54.723
Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16770-0
01:30:54.543 --> 01:30:55.673
As a key value pair.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16771-0
01:30:54.733 --> 01:30:55.463
Is it like a?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16787-0
01:30:57.033 --> 01:30:59.483
Key value payments, but then key
value sees.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16800-0
01:30:59.543 --> 01:31:01.253
Always that what is the
keywords?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16809-0
01:31:01.263 --> 01:31:03.013
First you need to identify the
words right?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16844-0
01:31:03.603 --> 01:31:06.664
The important words, that is
what you are saying is that what

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16844-1
01:31:06.664 --> 01:31:09.824
Mr Manoj, you want to say, you
need to identify important words

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16844-2
01:31:09.824 --> 01:31:12.293
and look at the whether they're
occurring or not.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16857-0
01:31:12.333 --> 01:31:12.823
Is it correct?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16850-0
01:31:12.903 --> 01:31:13.673
Yeah. Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16866-0
01:31:13.683 --> 01:31:15.163
How many times is 3 occurring?
Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16863-0
01:31:15.413 --> 01:31:15.963
Yes, yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16868-0
01:31:15.973 --> 01:31:16.323
OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16887-0
01:31:16.393 --> 01:31:19.302
So that is essentially we are
saying that is a model that is

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16887-1
01:31:19.302 --> 01:31:20.923
referred as a bag of words
model.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16891-0
01:31:21.253 --> 01:31:21.833
So.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16915-0
01:31:21.893 --> 01:31:24.818
So The thing is that we know a
sentence makes sense only if we

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16915-1
01:31:24.818 --> 01:31:26.583
look at the sequence of the
sentence.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16971-0
01:31:27.073 --> 01:31:30.452
Once you change the sequence of
the sentence, the meaning

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16971-1
01:31:30.452 --> 01:31:33.656
changes or the meaning is
completely lost or or or the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16971-2
01:31:33.656 --> 01:31:36.860
meaning can become exact
opposite, because for example

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16971-3
01:31:36.860 --> 01:31:40.646
you change the position of, not
the meaning of the word sentence

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16971-4
01:31:40.646 --> 01:31:44.200
will change, but then the bag of
words does not consider the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/16971-5
01:31:44.200 --> 01:31:45.423
meaning bag of words.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17007-0
01:31:45.433 --> 01:31:49.239
Simply looks at the words and
the frequency in which, so this

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17007-1
01:31:49.239 --> 01:31:53.106
is 1 model which is the simplest
possible model to represent a

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17007-2
01:31:53.106 --> 01:31:55.623
document and then perform some
analysis.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17037-0
01:31:55.633 --> 01:31:59.056
Because this is we got a, we got
a matrix and obviously we can

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17037-1
01:31:59.056 --> 01:32:01.936
start performing many
mathematical operations and we

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17037-2
01:32:01.936 --> 01:32:03.403
can try to make some sense.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17064-0
01:32:03.643 --> 01:32:06.825
For example, you can say that
two documents are similar if

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17064-1
01:32:06.825 --> 01:32:10.061
they have the same words which
are repeating very often, so

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17064-2
01:32:10.061 --> 01:32:11.463
that can be one operation.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17068-0
01:32:12.413 --> 01:32:12.953
So.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17090-0
01:32:13.013 --> 01:32:17.300
So the point is that depending
on the data, so we need to think

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17090-1
01:32:17.300 --> 01:32:19.443
in terms of how to represent so.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17118-0
01:32:19.513 --> 01:32:23.979
So the document we may spend A
at some point little later about

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17118-1
01:32:23.979 --> 01:32:28.375
understanding how to create a
meaningful structures out of the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17118-2
01:32:28.375 --> 01:32:29.003
document.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17146-0
01:32:29.053 --> 01:32:32.870
But then I hope this explains
well enough saying that one

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17146-1
01:32:32.870 --> 01:32:36.950
simplest representation is to
identify the keywords as one of

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17146-2
01:32:36.950 --> 01:32:37.213
you.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17158-0
01:32:38.203 --> 01:32:41.033
One of you also pointed out the
same thing before.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17180-0
01:32:41.203 --> 01:32:45.103
Before even I mentioned it so,
so that can be one approach, but

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17180-1
01:32:45.103 --> 01:32:48.333
there can be more approaches
that we will see later.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17206-0
01:32:48.823 --> 01:32:51.962
So then we can have a
transaction data so that we can

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17206-1
01:32:51.962 --> 01:32:54.113
simply represent as a list of
items.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17234-0
01:32:54.483 --> 01:32:58.074
But we need to be clear that
this list of items we are taking

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17234-1
01:32:58.074 --> 01:33:01.666
the Market Basket example for
easy understanding, but you can

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17234-2
01:33:01.666 --> 01:33:03.693
also have examples like like
this.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17236-0
01:33:06.013 --> 01:33:06.443
Young.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17239-0
01:33:08.793 --> 01:33:09.143
Rich.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17243-0
01:33:11.343 --> 01:33:14.113
And then possibly.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17246-0
01:33:16.803 --> 01:33:17.383
Educated.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17268-0
01:33:20.983 --> 01:33:25.979
And and then possibly something
more or we can say we can go

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17268-1
01:33:25.979 --> 01:33:27.453
into the American.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17275-0
01:33:27.503 --> 01:33:29.733
So without controversy, we can
use that a Democrat.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17299-0
01:33:32.043 --> 01:33:37.589
And then similarly we can say
another person is senior citizen

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17299-1
01:33:37.589 --> 01:33:41.903
and then the person is, let's
say middle income.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17327-0
01:33:44.293 --> 01:33:48.797
Middle income I'm I'm trying to
put something I'm like pen

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17327-1
01:33:48.797 --> 01:33:53.453
middle income and then let's say
let's say educated and then

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17327-2
01:33:53.453 --> 01:33:54.293
Republican.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17349-0
01:33:56.083 --> 01:33:59.884
So now even when you create a
list of this, you can still do

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17349-1
01:33:59.884 --> 01:34:01.193
association analysis.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17373-0
01:34:02.793 --> 01:34:06.345
So Market Basket example is easy
to understand, but you can

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17373-1
01:34:06.345 --> 01:34:09.543
always say that young people
tend to be rich or rich.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17382-0
01:34:09.553 --> 01:34:12.223
People tend to be Democrats, so
on and so forth.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17398-0
01:34:12.233 --> 01:34:15.066
So there is there are so many
other problems that patterns

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17398-1
01:34:15.066 --> 01:34:16.123
that you can discover.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17400-0
01:34:16.823 --> 01:34:17.293
OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17468-0
01:34:17.363 --> 01:34:21.278
And then graph data I do not
think I need to explain so the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17468-1
01:34:21.278 --> 01:34:25.128
web is a graph where each
document is linked to many other

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17468-2
01:34:25.128 --> 01:34:29.239
documents and similarly you can
have a graphs to represent the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17468-3
01:34:29.239 --> 01:34:33.415
roadways railway networks, the
communication networks and a lot

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17468-4
01:34:33.415 --> 01:34:37.526
of things and social media which
is offering a lot of networks

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17468-5
01:34:37.526 --> 01:34:39.223
like LinkedIn or Facebook.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17501-0
01:34:39.653 --> 01:34:44.311
So we may want to analyze such
data and and that is just to say

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17501-1
01:34:44.311 --> 01:34:48.679
that that is another variety of
data we have and then order

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17501-2
01:34:48.679 --> 01:34:49.043
data.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17528-0
01:34:49.173 --> 01:34:52.444
We have already seen that we can
find sequential patterns from

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17528-1
01:34:52.444 --> 01:34:55.610
the order later and we may have
an order date of the form of

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17528-2
01:34:55.610 --> 01:34:56.493
genomic sequence.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17618-0
01:34:58.683 --> 01:35:02.652
So again, from there we can find
the sequential patterns, but

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17618-1
01:35:02.652 --> 01:35:06.750
then how we use the pattern and
how to really how to make sense

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17618-2
01:35:06.750 --> 01:35:10.527
out of the pattern that that's
way beyond, but then we can

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17618-3
01:35:10.527 --> 01:35:14.561
still find a pattern saying that
somebody is saying that there

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17618-4
01:35:14.561 --> 01:35:18.722
are two gene sequences I got and
then how frequently I find that

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17618-5
01:35:18.722 --> 01:35:22.692
this pattern so so they can look
at this sequence saying that

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17618-6
01:35:22.692 --> 01:35:24.933
because the sequence is
important.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17640-0
01:35:25.353 --> 01:35:29.043
So The thing is that you will
find only four types of

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17640-1
01:35:29.043 --> 01:35:32.801
alphabets repeating, but then
the sequence is making a

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17640-2
01:35:32.801 --> 01:35:33.553
difference.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17644-0
01:35:33.563 --> 01:35:33.973
So.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17655-0
01:35:34.063 --> 01:35:36.683
So we can say that this is also
one of the sequential problems.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17672-0
01:35:39.343 --> 01:35:43.727
Audio it can be considered
sequential, but more often it is

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17672-1
01:35:43.727 --> 01:35:43.873
a.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17697-0
01:35:43.933 --> 01:35:48.356
It is a more of a time series
and what you can see is that you

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17697-1
01:35:48.356 --> 01:35:50.743
are possibly taking the
sampling.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17747-0
01:35:50.783 --> 01:35:55.509
You're doing the sampling at
regular intervals because audio

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17747-1
01:35:55.509 --> 01:35:59.848
we need to consider as a
continuous data, but then, but

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17747-2
01:35:59.848 --> 01:36:04.574
then we we stick with setting
frequent no set in a frequency

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17747-3
01:36:04.574 --> 01:36:08.681
of sampling and then take the
data and then we start

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17747-4
01:36:08.681 --> 01:36:09.533
processing.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17768-0
01:36:11.403 --> 01:36:15.223
And then video or sorry image
image, we can take it as A2

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17768-1
01:36:15.223 --> 01:36:16.343
dimensional data.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17787-0
01:36:19.263 --> 01:36:24.421
Sport, black and white or Gray
images, and then we can treat

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17787-1
01:36:24.421 --> 01:36:26.873
that as a 3 dimensional data.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17806-0
01:36:27.163 --> 01:36:31.309
So or three sets of two
dimensional data for the purpose

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17806-1
01:36:31.309 --> 01:36:32.473
of color images.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17827-0
01:36:33.543 --> 01:36:38.260
Because we store red, green,
blue independently for color

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17827-1
01:36:38.260 --> 01:36:43.303
images for black and white, we
simply store pixel Gray level.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17851-0
01:36:53.943 --> 01:36:57.598
And now the question will be
that how are we going to work

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17851-1
01:36:57.598 --> 01:36:59.023
with this type of data?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17898-0
01:37:01.013 --> 01:37:05.210
So so we we may, it is just to
as a some of you may already

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17898-1
01:37:05.210 --> 01:37:09.476
know, nowadays we are working
with the neural networks which

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17898-2
01:37:09.476 --> 01:37:13.533
have got a which have the
ability to take large number of

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17898-3
01:37:13.533 --> 01:37:14.023
inputs.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17920-0
01:37:14.433 --> 01:37:19.225
Suppose that you somehow have
got a image which is of this

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17920-1
01:37:19.225 --> 01:37:21.093
size 100 by 100 pixels.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17951-0
01:37:21.613 --> 01:37:25.890
So there are, it is not at all
difficult to design or a neural

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17951-1
01:37:25.890 --> 01:37:29.828
network which takes 10,000
inputs and we start processing

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17951-2
01:37:29.828 --> 01:37:31.593
them with multiple layers.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17999-0
01:37:32.253 --> 01:37:36.931
So the here what is happening is
that that 10,800 by 100 emails

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17999-1
01:37:36.931 --> 01:37:41.316
became a U uni dimensional
vector of 10,000 size and we are

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17999-2
01:37:41.316 --> 01:37:45.629
working but then we can also
find the patterns using other

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/17999-3
01:37:45.629 --> 01:37:46.433
mechanisms.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18014-0
01:37:47.403 --> 01:37:51.213
Uh and then start working with
the patterns that we discovered.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18034-0
01:37:51.223 --> 01:37:54.713
In fact, many times those
patterns are what we do is we do

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18034-1
01:37:54.713 --> 01:37:56.133
some type of operations.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18073-0
01:37:56.143 --> 01:38:00.556
They are referred if some of you
are familiar called convolution,

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18073-1
01:38:00.556 --> 01:38:04.501
whereby identify the local
patterns of the adjacent pixels

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18073-2
01:38:04.501 --> 01:38:07.443
and thereby did they look for
the features.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18086-0
01:38:07.743 --> 01:38:12.623
So so there are ways in which
people have found ways.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18110-0
01:38:12.773 --> 01:38:16.187
But then but then after
converting them, not keeping it

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18110-1
01:38:16.187 --> 01:38:19.357
as image as it is, but then
converting it into some

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18110-2
01:38:19.357 --> 01:38:20.333
structured data.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18140-0
01:38:21.303 --> 01:38:24.917
Though it is referred as an
unstructured data in almost all

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18140-1
01:38:24.917 --> 01:38:28.773
textbooks, but then people found
ways to convert it into create

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18140-2
01:38:28.773 --> 01:38:31.363
some structure and then discover
the pack.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18157-0
01:38:38.643 --> 01:38:42.053
Now let us look at the topic of
for data quality.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18165-0
01:38:43.703 --> 01:38:44.193
It's a.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18172-0
01:38:44.203 --> 01:38:45.533
It's actually a very big topic.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18214-0
01:38:45.543 --> 01:38:49.724
A lot of people have published a
lot of articles on quality

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18214-1
01:38:49.724 --> 01:38:53.835
because quality is not such an
easy thing to define though

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18214-2
01:38:53.835 --> 01:38:58.225
though it is something which we
we all want, it is not easy to

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18214-3
01:38:58.225 --> 01:38:58.713
define.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18230-0
01:38:59.003 --> 01:39:03.160
So we let us look at some way in
which we can define data

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18230-1
01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:03.733
quality.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18247-0
01:39:04.023 --> 01:39:08.185
So our authors are putting it in
terms of accuracy, completeness,

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18247-1
01:39:08.185 --> 01:39:11.843
consistency, timeliness,
believability, interpretability.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18252-0
01:39:16.513 --> 01:39:17.303
So.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18264-0
01:39:17.363 --> 01:39:21.789
So the point is that data
quality can be these are the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18264-1
01:39:21.789 --> 01:39:22.353
causes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18269-0
01:39:24.293 --> 01:39:25.143
Some of the causes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18276-0
01:39:32.143 --> 01:39:35.843
Off back quality or look
quality.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18311-0
01:39:42.713 --> 01:39:47.949
But there can be many moods, so
The thing is that we have a one

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18311-1
01:39:47.949 --> 01:39:52.694
of the big problems in modeling
for any of the task is to

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18311-2
01:39:52.694 --> 01:39:55.803
identify which attribute is
relevant.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18346-0
01:39:57.803 --> 01:40:03.130
So that is not not not listed in
any of the issues, but if you

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18346-1
01:40:03.130 --> 01:40:07.949
are unable to identify the
relevant data, your model can

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18346-2
01:40:07.949 --> 01:40:09.133
never be good.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18380-0
01:40:16.073 --> 01:40:20.920
The data quality like orphan
data in case of relational data

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18380-1
01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:23.463
only right Harpending otherwise.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18371-0
01:40:22.793 --> 01:40:23.663
It can be.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18392-0
01:40:23.673 --> 01:40:27.856
See the orphan data is something
which we cannot have a reference

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18392-1
01:40:27.856 --> 01:40:28.363
bare by.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18417-0
01:40:28.373 --> 01:40:32.803
We can comment on that data so
so something.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18408-0
01:40:30.703 --> 01:40:31.513
Yeah, that.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18439-0
01:40:31.883 --> 01:40:35.616
But it is only in the case of
relational database, not not in

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18439-1
01:40:35.616 --> 01:40:37.363
the case of irrigation means.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18433-0
01:40:38.043 --> 01:40:38.393
Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18441-0
01:40:38.403 --> 01:40:39.053
Well, you can.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18476-0
01:40:39.133 --> 01:40:42.710
You can say that if it is, if it
is not a structured data, how

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18476-1
01:40:42.710 --> 01:40:46.173
can you think in terms of a
parent or a hierarchy 3 to fine?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18473-0
01:40:44.013 --> 01:40:44.413
Jackie.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18489-0
01:40:46.383 --> 01:40:49.393
So there is no connecting master
data, so fine, fine.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18492-0
01:40:49.403 --> 01:40:49.753
I'll.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18495-0
01:40:49.803 --> 01:40:50.453
I'll take it.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18521-0
01:40:50.463 --> 01:40:54.091
It is a structured data right
here, but we also need to

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18521-1
01:40:54.091 --> 01:40:58.173
understand today there are no
there are many no SQL databases.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18562-0
01:40:58.183 --> 01:41:01.329
They say that they are not
relational, but a lot of data

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18562-1
01:41:01.329 --> 01:41:04.531
that they store has some
structure but different types of

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18562-2
01:41:04.531 --> 01:41:07.954
structures from the different
based on the different types of

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18562-3
01:41:07.954 --> 01:41:09.113
the no SQL databases.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18598-0
01:41:09.563 --> 01:41:13.870
So they may also have orphan
data in the sense that the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18598-1
01:41:13.870 --> 01:41:18.331
missing graphical link or
missing uh is some associations

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18598-2
01:41:18.331 --> 01:41:22.253
that are missing between the
records or or tuples.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18613-0
01:41:22.263 --> 01:41:26.143
So several things can happen so,
but then I'll take it.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18622-0
01:41:26.193 --> 01:41:28.213
I'll take it that yes, if it
isn't.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18626-0
01:41:28.223 --> 01:41:29.843
If the structure is missing
then.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18641-0
01:41:34.883 --> 01:41:39.523
Any any comments on data quality
or fine?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18644-0
01:41:39.533 --> 01:41:40.573
So we'll proceed further.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18659-0
01:41:47.713 --> 01:41:52.473
So some of the some more thing
is noise and outliers.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18673-0
01:41:52.943 --> 01:41:57.693
So the noise is a something
which comes from video sources.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18721-0
01:41:58.073 --> 01:42:02.903
So for example, you go to a
shopping a some shop and then

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18721-1
01:42:02.903 --> 01:42:07.983
when you buy a product, uh, they
ask for maybe maybe in some

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18721-2
01:42:07.983 --> 01:42:13.313
places they want to keep a track
of their customer information.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18738-0
01:42:13.903 --> 01:42:17.693
So they want you to put the data
on the me ask you for some data.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18764-0
01:42:18.183 --> 01:42:23.854
So let's say you give a #34 the
person types in as 43, so it is

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18764-1
01:42:23.854 --> 01:42:24.563
a noise.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18769-0
01:42:24.673 --> 01:42:25.683
It is an error.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18790-0
01:42:26.173 --> 01:42:29.277
It is pretty random because the
person may be typing for 99

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18790-1
01:42:29.277 --> 01:42:30.933
people correctly for one person.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18825-0
01:42:30.943 --> 01:42:34.946
They make the person may be
typing wrongly, so there can be

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18825-1
01:42:34.946 --> 01:42:39.015
many varied sources, so it is a
highly unpredictable type of

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18825-2
01:42:39.015 --> 01:42:40.883
error that we call as noise.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18845-0
01:42:40.933 --> 01:42:45.250
We do not know how to get rid of
noise, so the noise is something

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18845-1
01:42:45.250 --> 01:42:46.493
that we don't know.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18848-0
01:42:46.583 --> 01:42:47.843
It is always negative.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18856-0
01:42:52.023 --> 01:42:54.703
Noise has always a negative
influence.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18861-0
01:42:59.183 --> 01:43:00.233
On our process.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18892-0
01:43:00.623 --> 01:43:05.833
So but then it is possible that
sometimes there is a data which

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18892-1
01:43:05.833 --> 01:43:10.962
is significantly deviating from
the other data, so that may be

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18892-2
01:43:10.962 --> 01:43:12.753
very useful sometimes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18917-0
01:43:13.103 --> 01:43:17.163
But that may be there are there
are sometimes, as we discussed

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18917-1
01:43:17.163 --> 01:43:21.353
so out, clear analysis is a task
by itself because outliers are.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18937-0
01:43:21.363 --> 01:43:24.920
So interesting in set I'm cases
there are certain business

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18937-1
01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:27.633
problems for which outliers are
very import.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18946-0
01:43:30.333 --> 01:43:32.003
Then inaccurate data.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18975-0
01:43:32.013 --> 01:43:35.512
Again, the inaccurate data can
be caused by various reasons, so

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18960-0
01:43:34.403 --> 01:43:34.713
Sorry.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18975-1
01:43:35.512 --> 01:43:38.901
it's again inaccuracy can be
instrumentation, but it can also

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18975-2
01:43:38.901 --> 01:43:39.503
be a noise.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18996-0
01:43:41.943 --> 01:43:46.064
Sorry to interrupt, but in the
previous slide one I have a one

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/18996-1
01:43:46.064 --> 01:43:46.653
question.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19017-0
01:43:46.743 --> 01:43:48.753
In the previous slide input.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19001-0
01:43:47.323 --> 01:43:48.153
Yes, OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19014-0
01:43:48.163 --> 01:43:49.853
OK, I I go to the previous
slide.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19025-0
01:43:49.863 --> 01:43:50.633
Just give me one minute.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19019-0
01:43:50.273 --> 01:43:50.883
Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19038-0
01:43:50.933 --> 01:43:55.463
So in coding of the data is also
the quality of the issue.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19046-0
01:43:55.633 --> 01:43:58.873
But in coding isn't something
system related.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19060-0
01:43:58.883 --> 01:44:01.343
Things not the collection of the
data.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19088-0
01:44:02.273 --> 01:44:05.990
That is true, but then when we
have data from multiple sources

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19088-1
01:44:05.990 --> 01:44:09.530
and they somehow chosen to
encode it in different way, that

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19088-2
01:44:09.530 --> 01:44:11.123
can become a quality issue.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19103-0
01:44:11.133 --> 01:44:14.313
But, but that is true as long as
you know the encoding.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19108-0
01:44:14.323 --> 01:44:15.593
You should be able to decode.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19114-0
01:44:16.773 --> 01:44:18.603
Uh umm?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19121-0
01:44:18.643 --> 01:44:19.703
Any example Sir?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19125-0
01:44:20.973 --> 01:44:21.823
No encoding.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19174-0
01:44:21.833 --> 01:44:26.181
For example, simple thing is
that you have two offices where

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19174-1
01:44:26.181 --> 01:44:30.387
they are following a different
conventions for putting the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19174-2
01:44:30.387 --> 01:44:35.020
address or putting something so
or it may be sometimes interbank

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19174-3
01:44:35.020 --> 01:44:39.297
transaction so they put the
things in a different format or

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19174-4
01:44:39.297 --> 01:44:40.723
different structure.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19189-0
01:44:41.213 --> 01:44:44.454
So somebody is putting the date
of birth and somebody is putting

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19189-1
01:44:44.454 --> 01:44:44.803
it day.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19222-0
01:44:44.813 --> 01:44:48.947
Is that itself can be a
difference or somebody is using

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19222-1
01:44:48.947 --> 01:44:53.303
for example the two three types
of products that they have

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19222-2
01:44:53.303 --> 01:44:54.853
small, medium, large.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19226-0
01:44:54.923 --> 01:44:56.343
Let's say they're coding.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19241-0
01:44:56.353 --> 01:44:59.503
That has 123 other people are
putting it as 321.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19245-0
01:45:00.563 --> 01:45:00.883
Umm.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19248-0
01:45:02.043 --> 01:45:02.593
Anything.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19274-0
01:45:02.603 --> 01:45:05.603
I mean any any way where you
have a different encoding it

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19274-1
01:45:05.603 --> 01:45:08.293
becomes a problem, but then
that's not a big issue.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19271-0
01:45:06.463 --> 01:45:06.763
OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19299-0
01:45:08.303 --> 01:45:12.746
So as you said, if you are able
to get the codes correct, but

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19299-1
01:45:12.746 --> 01:45:16.903
then sometimes you you also have
the associated problems.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19342-0
01:45:17.913 --> 01:45:21.526
So suppose that there are dates
which are coming from the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19342-1
01:45:21.526 --> 01:45:25.325
multiple sources you're now you
cannot be sure that are they

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19342-2
01:45:25.325 --> 01:45:29.311
following the same conventional
put the writing the date in DMY

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19342-3
01:45:29.311 --> 01:45:29.623
also.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19394-0
01:45:30.833 --> 01:45:34.534
OK, we'll get like a we can give
the example of shared having a

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19394-1
01:45:34.534 --> 01:45:37.946
large, medium and short, but
also that 4236 and 44 because

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19394-2
01:45:37.946 --> 01:45:40.433
two way of representation of the
same set.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19411-0
01:45:40.013 --> 01:45:43.447
Yeah, yeah, that is also
possible because one company may

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19411-1
01:45:43.447 --> 01:45:46.763
call short is 32, but another
may call up to 34, right?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19420-0
01:45:46.773 --> 01:45:48.083
So that is always possible here.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19430-0
01:45:48.393 --> 01:45:51.243
So there is nothing like nothing
like ours.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19436-0
01:45:51.253 --> 01:45:52.373
Expertise is involved.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19452-0
01:45:52.383 --> 01:45:55.398
All we know is that when we get
data from multiple sources,

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19452-1
01:45:55.398 --> 01:45:56.403
there can be errors.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19455-0
01:45:58.153 --> 01:45:58.483
OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19457-0
01:45:58.533 --> 01:45:58.933
Thanks Sir.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19477-0
01:46:06.713 --> 01:46:11.526
Alright, so we are talking about
noise outliers, inaccurate data

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19477-1
01:46:11.526 --> 01:46:13.673
and inconsistent data. Right.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19493-0
01:46:14.753 --> 01:46:19.063
And let us take an example to
see the data quality issues.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19504-0
01:46:19.833 --> 01:46:22.193
I'm sure you will be able to
find many of them here, right?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19524-0
01:46:24.523 --> 01:46:26.943
So if somebody wants to read out
any issue that they found.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19549-0
01:46:28.123 --> 01:46:30.893
Percentage issue well.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19540-0
01:46:28.373 --> 01:46:28.933
Here for me.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19545-0
01:46:28.723 --> 01:46:30.093
That way both of both.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19544-0
01:46:29.203 --> 01:46:29.923
Date formats.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19548-0
01:46:30.043 --> 01:46:30.623
Wait for me.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19564-0
01:46:31.953 --> 01:46:33.523
This missing data person?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19562-0
01:46:32.313 --> 01:46:33.113
Missing data.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19570-0
01:46:32.683 --> 01:46:34.043
Miss missing data.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19568-0
01:46:34.753 --> 01:46:35.463
Yeah, absolutely.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19597-0
01:46:35.473 --> 01:46:38.073
Absolutely yes, it is 175.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19592-0
01:46:36.043 --> 01:46:37.393
Percentage percentage.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19595-0
01:46:36.703 --> 01:46:38.023
But Centage is incorrect.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19599-0
01:46:37.503 --> 01:46:38.703
Percentage is 175.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19609-0
01:46:38.963 --> 01:46:39.283
That's it.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19628-0
01:46:39.673 --> 01:46:42.413
Yes, yes, straight absolutely
yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19620-0
01:46:40.063 --> 01:46:41.113
Present day 125.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19629-0
01:46:41.283 --> 01:46:43.843
Yeah, 175 could be outlier data
maybe.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19644-0
01:46:45.703 --> 01:46:47.323
And duplicate data as well.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19642-0
01:46:47.283 --> 01:46:48.153
ID's.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19648-0
01:46:47.593 --> 01:46:48.843
Duplicate data is there.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19646-0
01:46:48.163 --> 01:46:48.703
Uh.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19661-0
01:46:48.863 --> 01:46:51.363
Missing ID duplicated.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19662-0
01:46:50.543 --> 01:46:50.863
Because.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19655-0
01:46:51.433 --> 01:46:51.903
Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19659-0
01:46:51.913 --> 01:46:52.923
So so there is.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19675-0
01:46:52.973 --> 01:46:55.883
Yeah, I think you, I think we
found almost everything.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19673-0
01:46:53.583 --> 01:46:53.853
Different.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19693-0
01:46:55.973 --> 01:46:58.951
So so let me go and give the
answer also, because you found

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19693-1
01:46:58.951 --> 01:47:00.093
already all the values.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19720-0
01:47:04.073 --> 01:47:07.825
So you can see that because of
the date of birth and days, it

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19720-1
01:47:07.825 --> 01:47:11.033
is easy to recognize that
something is inconsistent.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19745-0
01:47:11.913 --> 01:47:15.586
So, but the format of age, date
of birth is also inconsistent

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19745-1
01:47:15.586 --> 01:47:19.023
and sometimes the age and date
of birth are not matching.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19755-0
01:47:19.033 --> 01:47:21.553
So essentially so that gives
rise to another problem.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19758-0
01:47:23.093 --> 01:47:23.723
Uh, Sir?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19763-0
01:47:23.763 --> 01:47:24.703
I just one thing.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19778-0
01:47:24.713 --> 01:47:28.643
So, uh, like when we observe
such kind of inconsistent data.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19805-0
01:47:28.653 --> 01:47:33.961
So do we follow any compensating
functionality or structure to

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19805-1
01:47:33.961 --> 01:47:38.343
handle or to operate on such an
inconsistent datas?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19858-0
01:47:38.513 --> 01:47:43.356
Or do we have certain kind of
algorithm of modeling of such

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19881-0
01:47:43.223 --> 01:47:47.085
See, there are many tools which
which help you identify the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19858-1
01:47:43.356 --> 01:47:44.083
data? Uh.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19881-1
01:47:47.085 --> 01:47:50.946
problems in the data and all you
all you have to do is that

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19881-2
01:47:50.946 --> 01:47:55.001
because there are so many ETL
tools that that are there in the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19881-3
01:47:55.001 --> 01:47:58.863
market, so sometimes they call
them and sells as ELT tools.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19890-0
01:47:59.103 --> 01:48:00.693
Sometimes they call them as ETL
tools.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19912-0
01:48:00.703 --> 01:48:04.884
So essentially they do the they
take the data and then do the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19912-1
01:48:04.884 --> 01:48:06.503
checks that you propose.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19930-0
01:48:08.083 --> 01:48:11.037
Saying that this has to follow
this rule then so you can give

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19920-0
01:48:08.193 --> 01:48:08.533
OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19930-1
01:48:11.037 --> 01:48:11.943
some set and rules.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19947-0
01:48:11.953 --> 01:48:15.654
So, so whereby they can validate
and give you all their

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19947-1
01:48:15.654 --> 01:48:16.513
observations.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19948-0
01:48:17.403 --> 01:48:18.313
OK. OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19994-0
01:48:18.323 --> 01:48:21.733
So from the observation
perspective, we have tools but

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19994-1
01:48:21.733 --> 01:48:25.267
like if you want to have propose
some solution over that

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19994-2
01:48:25.267 --> 01:48:27.623
inconsistent data so that it
becomes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/19980-0
01:48:25.653 --> 01:48:25.963
Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20009-0
01:48:25.973 --> 01:48:28.516
If you say that you want to
replace something, for example

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20009-1
01:48:28.516 --> 01:48:31.319
default value for certain field
that you want to put wherever it

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20019-0
01:48:31.043 --> 01:48:31.263
Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20009-2
01:48:31.319 --> 01:48:31.793
is missing.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20016-0
01:48:31.803 --> 01:48:32.723
Yeah, it will do that.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20021-0
01:48:32.713 --> 01:48:33.003
No.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20023-0
01:48:32.773 --> 01:48:33.133
It will do.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20024-0
01:48:34.073 --> 01:48:34.543
OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20029-0
01:48:34.553 --> 01:48:36.363
OK, OK. Got it.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20037-0
01:48:37.373 --> 01:48:37.823
Thank you.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20049-0
01:48:38.893 --> 01:48:42.763
Alright, so now let us go into
data model.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20073-0
01:48:43.233 --> 01:48:46.633
So what I will do is we have 10
minutes, so I'll just see

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20073-1
01:48:46.633 --> 01:48:48.803
whether a data model we can
discuss.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20093-0
01:48:48.813 --> 01:48:52.937
I'm just waiting for a few
seconds to see if if everything

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20093-1
01:48:52.937 --> 01:48:55.453
is clear, so feel free to bring
up.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20116-0
01:48:56.183 --> 01:48:59.949
Uh, is this the last class for
you today or I think this is the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20116-1
01:48:59.949 --> 01:49:01.303
4th last class for you.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20120-0
01:49:01.313 --> 01:49:01.513
Right.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20126-0
01:49:01.923 --> 01:49:02.983
OK. So.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20125-0
01:49:02.593 --> 01:49:02.733
Yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20124-0
01:49:02.843 --> 01:49:03.823
Yes, yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20130-0
01:49:03.563 --> 01:49:03.673
Yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20131-0
01:49:04.803 --> 01:49:05.403
OK, OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20155-0
01:49:05.413 --> 01:49:09.309
So I don't have a constraint
that I have to close it at 5:50,

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20155-1
01:49:09.309 --> 01:49:11.823
is that is that a fair
expectation? No.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20160-0
01:49:13.693 --> 01:49:13.933
OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20161-0
01:49:14.583 --> 01:49:14.853
And.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20172-0
01:49:15.423 --> 01:49:15.813
Yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20177-0
01:49:15.713 --> 01:49:18.453
Yeah, like there's too much of
download download today, Sir.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20179-0
01:49:15.903 --> 01:49:16.123
Alright.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20202-0
01:49:18.463 --> 01:49:19.153
Can we do it next?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20189-0
01:49:18.493 --> 01:49:18.833
Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20191-0
01:49:18.843 --> 01:49:19.423
Yeah, that.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20195-0
01:49:19.493 --> 01:49:20.183
Yeah, I agree.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20200-0
01:49:20.193 --> 01:49:20.723
I agree.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20242-0
01:49:20.733 --> 01:49:24.324
That's why I'm I'm giving a I'm
giving you a break for a few

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20213-0
01:49:21.473 --> 01:49:21.673
No.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20242-1
01:49:24.324 --> 01:49:27.739
seconds just to think about
anything that we discussed so

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20242-2
01:49:27.739 --> 01:49:31.272
far is that leaving you confused
or or I can proceed little

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20242-3
01:49:31.272 --> 01:49:31.743
further.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20252-0
01:49:31.753 --> 01:49:33.303
I have 10 minutes about so we
can.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20259-0
01:49:33.313 --> 01:49:36.153
Anyway, we'll proceed if there
are no questions.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20262-0
01:49:36.673 --> 01:49:37.523
OK, we'll proceed.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20277-0
01:49:41.273 --> 01:49:45.183
So now let us look at what to do
with a model.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20291-0
01:49:45.553 --> 01:49:50.413
So this is taken from the
reference book, the Art of Data

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20291-1
01:49:50.413 --> 01:49:51.083
Science.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20306-0
01:49:51.633 --> 01:49:55.903
So this is a the entire book is
available at the URL.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20324-0
01:49:56.673 --> 01:50:03.723
So now you can see that the data
science is not a linear process.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20332-0
01:50:04.293 --> 01:50:06.723
It is not even simply iterative
process.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20352-0
01:50:06.733 --> 01:50:10.342
So what they say is that at
every stage there is an

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20352-1
01:50:10.342 --> 01:50:11.383
iteration, not.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20376-0
01:50:11.433 --> 01:50:15.615
It's not an iteration at the
entire cycle, so so the point

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20376-1
01:50:15.615 --> 01:50:19.443
that the that the author is
trying to convey is that.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20394-0
01:50:20.393 --> 01:50:23.775
So you start with a data, but
you cannot be sure that that is

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20394-1
01:50:23.775 --> 01:50:24.703
the correct data.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20401-0
01:50:24.713 --> 01:50:25.873
That data quality is good.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20443-0
01:50:25.883 --> 01:50:30.859
The data is relevant and and so
on, and then you come and you

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20443-1
01:50:30.859 --> 01:50:35.514
say that you want to find
certain pattern, so you need to

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20443-2
01:50:35.514 --> 01:50:39.929
see whether is that the
important pattern or is that a

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20443-3
01:50:39.929 --> 01:50:41.133
useful pattern?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20460-0
01:50:41.143 --> 01:50:45.035
Or is that the pattern that is
the business is really looking

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20460-1
01:50:45.035 --> 01:50:45.663
for order?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20486-0
01:50:45.673 --> 01:50:48.673
Or is it that something that the
business never asked, but you

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20486-1
01:50:48.673 --> 01:50:51.483
think that it is useful and you
want to go back and check?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20507-0
01:50:51.493 --> 01:50:55.303
Do you want to do you like this
type of packet and at every

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20507-1
01:50:55.303 --> 01:50:57.843
point there is this level of
iteration?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20511-0
01:50:57.853 --> 01:50:58.023
What?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20515-0
01:50:58.033 --> 01:50:58.983
That what he's saying.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20539-0
01:50:59.293 --> 01:51:04.189
What they are saying is that
every place there is something

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20539-1
01:51:04.189 --> 01:51:07.943
that you want to go back and
keep performing.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20556-0
01:51:07.953 --> 01:51:12.443
So so this is what the art of
data science they are saying.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20585-0
01:51:12.823 --> 01:51:19.715
So they are looking at things as
as a highly nonlinear and every

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20585-1
01:51:19.715 --> 01:51:25.653
place there is some learning and
there is a refinement.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20603-0
01:51:27.733 --> 01:51:30.705
Not much, and now we are going
into what is a statistical

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20603-1
01:51:30.705 --> 01:51:31.013
model.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20616-0
01:51:31.813 --> 01:51:36.725
So that is to help understand a
generalization of the nature of

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20616-1
01:51:36.725 --> 01:51:37.723
data science.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20633-0
01:51:37.923 --> 01:51:41.823
But first thing you want to do
is that we get a data, we get

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20633-1
01:51:41.823 --> 01:51:42.143
data.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20662-0
01:51:42.553 --> 01:51:48.485
Suppose that I got a data saying
that I am teaching uh it class

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20662-1
01:51:48.485 --> 01:51:51.173
for BITS third year students.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20670-0
01:51:51.783 --> 01:51:54.973
I got data of those those
people.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20678-0
01:51:54.983 --> 01:51:56.553
First thing I got is age.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20692-0
01:51:57.343 --> 01:52:04.203
They age is 191820211918.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20700-0
01:52:04.943 --> 01:52:05.963
So what can I do with this?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20720-0
01:52:07.223 --> 01:52:11.683
So I know that the age is very
strongly range bound, right?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20747-0
01:52:12.543 --> 01:52:16.202
So I can think saying that I can
comfortably say that most of my

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20747-1
01:52:16.202 --> 01:52:19.073
all my students are around 19
years of age, right?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20762-0
01:52:20.403 --> 01:52:24.230
So that is something I'm able to
do so I can generate a

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20762-1
01:52:24.230 --> 01:52:24.913
statistic.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20787-0
01:52:28.293 --> 01:52:33.463
So first thing that I can do is
that whenever I have a a data, I

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20787-1
01:52:33.463 --> 01:52:35.213
can think in terms of.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20795-0
01:52:35.253 --> 01:52:36.733
Can I summarize the data?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20804-0
01:52:37.683 --> 01:52:42.223
I can summarize the data using
some of the metrics so.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20811-0
01:52:43.933 --> 01:52:45.123
And the Demi help.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20827-0
01:52:46.113 --> 01:52:51.090
So now, now what we are saying
is that that is possibly going

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20827-1
01:52:51.090 --> 01:52:51.973
to help us.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20845-0
01:52:54.573 --> 01:53:00.496
And but then when we when we
impose saying that this is the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20845-1
01:53:00.496 --> 01:53:01.483
structure.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20871-0
01:53:01.493 --> 01:53:07.993
So I'm saying that my students
are of the age 19, my BITS third

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20871-1
01:53:07.993 --> 01:53:11.243
year students are of the age 19.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20881-0
01:53:11.773 --> 01:53:15.883
So now now the question that
comes up is that.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20889-0
01:53:17.873 --> 01:53:20.413
Is this an accurate expectation?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20911-0
01:53:25.173 --> 01:53:29.817
So this is a very simple data
element, but then you can have a

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20911-1
01:53:29.817 --> 01:53:32.103
multidimensional data elements.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20922-0
01:53:32.473 --> 01:53:38.023
So even there you may want to
recognize the patterns.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20926-0
01:53:38.473 --> 01:53:40.623
So now what?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20931-0
01:53:40.683 --> 01:53:41.743
Why is it important?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20942-0
01:53:41.753 --> 01:53:44.263
Because sometimes we may want to
work with the samples.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20944-0
01:53:45.433 --> 01:53:45.843
OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20953-0
01:53:46.383 --> 01:53:51.053
And and we may also want to know
some.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20998-0
01:53:52.453 --> 01:53:58.623
Ranges so that may help us in
another way, and it may help us

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20998-1
01:53:58.623 --> 01:54:05.191
generate saying that we say, OK,
19 years means is a teenager and

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20998-2
01:54:05.191 --> 01:54:10.565
we can expect certain
characteristics associated with

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/20998-3
01:54:10.565 --> 01:54:11.063
that.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21016-0
01:54:14.183 --> 01:54:18.953
Now let us see uh, we are almost
running out, but we will.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21062-0
01:54:18.963 --> 01:54:23.326
We will simply look at this
example and and maybe this

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21062-1
01:54:23.326 --> 01:54:28.165
example suppose that I we have
small survey on 20 people and

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21062-2
01:54:28.165 --> 01:54:33.083
the question that we are asking
is how much they are going to

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21062-3
01:54:33.083 --> 01:54:36.653
spend on a product and the
response is this.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21078-0
01:54:39.643 --> 01:54:44.153
Now the question is, so I hope
we talked.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21113-0
01:54:44.163 --> 01:54:47.210
I think we talked about in the
last class about election

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21113-1
01:54:47.210 --> 01:54:50.471
results because there are so
many agencies who are trying to

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21113-2
01:54:50.471 --> 01:54:52.663
work and they keep on trying to
predict.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21118-0
01:54:52.673 --> 01:54:54.233
I keep getting calls saying.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21129-0
01:54:54.713 --> 01:54:56.823
Can you share with us who did
you vote for?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21145-0
01:54:56.833 --> 01:55:01.069
Kind, but then they're not
obviously calling to the entire

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21145-1
01:55:01.069 --> 01:55:01.643
country.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21182-0
01:55:01.773 --> 01:55:04.941
They are only calling to a
randomly to some numbers some

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21182-1
01:55:04.941 --> 01:55:08.442
numbers, and then they're trying
to get their answers and then

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21182-2
01:55:08.442 --> 01:55:11.943
they're trying to see whether
they they'll be able to predict.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21200-0
01:55:12.413 --> 01:55:15.863
So in that case, the survey of
20 people is good or not.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21208-0
01:55:15.873 --> 01:55:18.143
Again, you need to judge it is
not.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21211-0
01:55:18.243 --> 01:55:18.653
It is.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21269-0
01:55:18.663 --> 01:55:23.798
There is no rule saying that 20
is good enough sample, but but

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21269-1
01:55:23.798 --> 01:55:28.851
then OK let us say we got the 20
elements and then we got the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21269-2
01:55:28.851 --> 01:55:33.823
data and then we have computed
some some statistics mean and

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21269-3
01:55:33.823 --> 01:55:38.958
standard deviation and then I
hope for everybody knows what is

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21269-4
01:55:38.958 --> 01:55:40.833
in normal distribution.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21285-0
01:55:41.343 --> 01:55:44.540
So we can say that the mean is
is available in standard

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21285-1
01:55:44.540 --> 01:55:45.853
deviation is available.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21312-0
01:55:45.863 --> 01:55:49.896
I can make a plot of normal
distribution and can I say that

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21312-1
01:55:49.896 --> 01:55:53.727
this normal distribution is
representing what people are

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21312-2
01:55:53.727 --> 01:55:55.743
willing to pay for my product?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21316-0
01:55:56.873 --> 01:55:57.393
What do you say?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21324-0
01:55:58.683 --> 01:55:59.613
What do you notice?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21327-0
01:55:59.623 --> 01:56:01.203
And you have any comment?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21341-0
01:56:05.403 --> 01:56:07.583
Every Sprint is around $17.00.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21348-0
01:56:09.973 --> 01:56:10.583
Uh.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21360-0
01:56:10.633 --> 01:56:14.023
Is is that a fair distribution?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21370-0
01:56:13.523 --> 01:56:13.793
But.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21376-0
01:56:14.033 --> 01:56:17.225
The standard, the normal
distribution that we have put,

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21376-1
01:56:17.225 --> 01:56:18.593
does it seem to be fair?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21377-0
01:56:17.883 --> 01:56:18.283
Both.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21410-0
01:56:19.913 --> 01:56:24.228
Most of the people are ready to
pay level level dollar ten point

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21410-1
01:56:24.228 --> 01:56:27.613
something the average price is
17 point something.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21420-0
01:56:28.183 --> 01:56:30.573
See average is we are matching
the average.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21435-0
01:56:30.583 --> 01:56:34.663
We are trying to match the
standard deviation, but when we

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21435-1
01:56:34.663 --> 01:56:37.153
make this plot, is it looking
fair?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21446-0
01:56:37.163 --> 01:56:39.543
Fair, fair representation of our
data.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21448-0
01:56:40.143 --> 01:56:40.703
Another.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21458-0
01:56:41.093 --> 01:56:41.263
No.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21487-0
01:56:41.193 --> 01:56:43.113
So I think there's too much
deviation.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21478-0
01:56:41.283 --> 01:56:42.713
No, you're not.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21485-0
01:56:41.533 --> 01:56:44.203
No, the accesses need to be
inverted.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21480-0
01:56:42.143 --> 01:56:42.763
It is not.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21506-0
01:56:44.473 --> 01:56:47.553
The density on the pop prices
need to be inverted so that.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21496-0
01:56:44.793 --> 01:56:45.293
Lots of.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21526-0
01:56:47.563 --> 01:56:50.083
There are a lot of extreme
cases.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21514-0
01:56:49.813 --> 01:56:50.143
Yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21535-0
01:56:50.033 --> 01:56:51.963
Really, the clients are low.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21518-0
01:56:50.333 --> 01:56:50.783
Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21582-0
01:56:50.833 --> 01:56:54.877
So so that is what so so do you
see any problems when we are

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21582-1
01:56:54.877 --> 01:56:59.119
looking at this so because what
we have got is you already even

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21582-2
01:56:59.119 --> 01:57:02.898
if you there is no need to
remember this, so this is the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21582-3
01:57:02.898 --> 01:57:06.743
data that we have and then this
is approximate histogram.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21576-0
01:57:03.323 --> 01:57:03.673
Something.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21624-0
01:57:07.313 --> 01:57:10.698
And then when we converted, when
we set that, OK, many times

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21624-1
01:57:10.698 --> 01:57:13.973
people represent that data is
normal distribution and then

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21624-2
01:57:13.973 --> 01:57:17.247
that that they solve some
modeling problems using that and

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21624-3
01:57:17.247 --> 01:57:18.413
we wanted to do that.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21640-0
01:57:18.423 --> 01:57:20.043
So what is the problem that we
are seeing?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21652-0
01:57:21.323 --> 01:57:23.153
That is not fitting into normal
distribution.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21650-0
01:57:23.413 --> 01:57:24.433
Absolutely right.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21658-0
01:57:24.443 --> 01:57:26.203
Data is not fitting into normal
distribution.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21679-0
01:57:26.273 --> 01:57:28.869
What are the reasons that you
see here what is the deviations

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21679-1
01:57:28.869 --> 01:57:29.623
that you see here?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21685-0
01:57:30.683 --> 01:57:32.483
25 is an outlier.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21728-0
01:57:33.423 --> 01:57:37.349
Yes, 25 is way off, so that is A
and and the other thing is that

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21728-1
01:57:37.349 --> 01:57:40.731
it is also allowing a negative
price because the normal

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21728-2
01:57:40.731 --> 01:57:44.415
distribution takes the mean and
tries to fit it along with a

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21728-3
01:57:44.415 --> 01:57:45.563
standard deviation.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21749-0
01:57:45.823 --> 01:57:48.233
So it is going saying that minus
10 is fine.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21758-0
01:57:48.403 --> 01:57:50.963
But then in this case, who is
going to give a product for a

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21758-1
01:57:50.963 --> 01:57:51.603
negative price?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21773-0
01:57:52.983 --> 01:57:56.181
So it is always positive, but
then this is unable to capture

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21773-1
01:57:56.181 --> 01:57:56.443
that.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21776-0
01:58:00.433 --> 01:58:01.183
So.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21823-0
01:58:01.233 --> 01:58:06.537
So what we are seeing is that we
have so many times data and then

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21823-1
01:58:06.537 --> 01:58:11.197
sometimes we have to model the
data because our algorithm

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21823-2
01:58:11.197 --> 01:58:16.260
demands certain model and then
thereby it is going to create a

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21823-3
01:58:16.260 --> 01:58:16.903
pattern.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21846-0
01:58:17.333 --> 01:58:20.697
But the model that we find is
not always we we have to be

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21846-1
01:58:20.697 --> 01:58:24.003
careful because we may not
always get the correct model.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21872-0
01:58:24.113 --> 01:58:28.350
So if we have, so if we take
this model and then we try to

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21872-1
01:58:28.350 --> 01:58:31.653
generate histogram, this will
look like this.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21890-0
01:58:32.053 --> 01:58:37.075
But this histogram is no where
close to the sampling that we

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21890-1
01:58:37.075 --> 01:58:38.393
had done survey.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21905-0
01:58:38.403 --> 01:58:42.144
We had done this survey is way
different from the histogram

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21905-1
01:58:42.144 --> 01:58:44.763
which matches this normal
representation.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21924-0
01:58:48.313 --> 01:58:52.377
So what that means is that we
need to look for possibly some

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21924-1
01:58:52.377 --> 01:58:54.043
alternate representation.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21942-0
01:58:54.513 --> 01:58:58.209
So one alternate representation
we can think of is a gamma

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21942-1
01:58:58.209 --> 01:58:59.023
distribution.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21955-0
01:59:00.483 --> 01:59:04.793
So a gamma distribution may
better fit in with this data.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21970-0
01:59:05.753 --> 01:59:10.457
So for the simple reason that
gamma distribution can take

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21970-1
01:59:10.457 --> 01:59:13.053
parameters that shape the curve.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21985-0
01:59:14.793 --> 01:59:20.503
And and then let us see how the
gamma distribution.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21987-0
01:59:20.513 --> 01:59:21.193
Do I have it?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21992-0
01:59:23.863 --> 01:59:24.713
Don't have it.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21994-0
01:59:24.863 --> 01:59:25.443
Just give me.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/21996-0
01:59:28.123 --> 01:59:28.383
K.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22002-0
01:59:31.143 --> 01:59:33.773
Maybe I'll I'll.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22007-0
01:59:33.883 --> 01:59:35.573
Yeah, like this is.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22010-0
01:59:37.173 --> 01:59:37.463
It's not.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22028-0
01:59:37.593 --> 01:59:41.346
Are we going to get that for the
direct standard deviations from

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22028-1
01:59:41.346 --> 01:59:42.963
the government institutions?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22058-0
01:59:42.973 --> 01:59:46.373
Explanations because we have the
new league.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22042-0
01:59:44.883 --> 01:59:45.513
Ohh.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22051-0
01:59:45.583 --> 01:59:46.773
Gonna standard deviation.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22053-0
01:59:46.883 --> 01:59:47.153
OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22064-0
01:59:47.163 --> 01:59:49.253
OK, you are saying standard
deviation definition.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22079-0
01:59:49.263 --> 01:59:52.834
Nobody has discussed till now,
right, Mr Mahindra is, is that

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22089-0
01:59:51.493 --> 01:59:54.233
Yeah, yeah, yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22079-1
01:59:52.834 --> 01:59:53.583
the question?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22085-0
01:59:53.973 --> 01:59:55.273
Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22127-0
01:59:55.333 --> 01:59:59.498
We will, we will be discussing
that I I had I I had assumed

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22127-1
01:59:59.498 --> 02:00:03.802
that OK, some people will know
and even when for others don't

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22127-2
02:00:03.802 --> 02:00:07.967
know I had already given a
disclaimer saying that you don't

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22127-3
02:00:07.967 --> 02:00:08.523
need to.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22144-0
02:00:09.133 --> 02:00:12.134
We will come to those
definitions as we come along, so

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22150-0
02:00:12.043 --> 02:00:12.283
OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22144-1
02:00:12.134 --> 02:00:12.843
that is fine.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22165-0
02:00:12.913 --> 02:00:16.541
So all we are saying is that
standard deviation is indication

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22165-1
02:00:16.541 --> 02:00:18.823
of how much variance that is
existing.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22177-0
02:00:19.253 --> 02:00:24.353
So for example, let me put to
explain the standard deviation.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22196-0
02:00:24.363 --> 02:00:28.227
Let me put two samples, so let
me let me put this I'm

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22196-1
02:00:28.227 --> 02:00:29.873
overrunning the time I.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22208-0
02:00:29.883 --> 02:00:31.903
Maybe I'm going to close it
pretty soon.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22222-0
02:00:32.713 --> 02:00:36.852
So suppose that there is an
organization, one where the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22222-1
02:00:36.852 --> 02:00:38.183
employee ages are.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22234-0
02:00:40.603 --> 02:00:47.293
252629 and 33.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22240-0
02:00:47.863 --> 02:00:48.413
OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22262-0
02:00:48.463 --> 02:00:57.423
Then the organization two, which
has got employees which is let

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22262-1
02:00:57.423 --> 02:01:00.783
me put 29 and 20 and 38.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22292-0
02:01:01.363 --> 02:01:05.407
So in both these organizations,
the mean age of the employees is

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22292-1
02:01:05.407 --> 02:01:08.953
same, but the differentiation is
the spread of the ages.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22305-0
02:01:09.283 --> 02:01:12.779
Mr Mahindra Reddy does it
explain so that is a standard

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22305-1
02:01:12.779 --> 02:01:13.903
deviation measure.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22328-0
02:01:14.123 --> 02:01:17.790
So we will give the formula but,
but this model example should

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22328-1
02:01:17.790 --> 02:01:21.283
tell you that this has a higher
deviation compared to this.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22334-0
02:01:21.553 --> 02:01:23.163
It's right.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22397-0
02:01:23.133 --> 02:01:28.837
But yeah, so that that means the
difference between the I mean

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22350-0
02:01:24.623 --> 02:01:25.973
Yeah, so this is what we will.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22367-0
02:01:25.983 --> 02:01:28.333
We will exact formula, but it's
not a big.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22397-1
02:01:28.837 --> 02:01:33.093
distance between the min and Max
of the range.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22382-0
02:01:32.813 --> 02:01:33.783
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22392-0
02:01:33.793 --> 02:01:34.543
Right, absolutely.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22408-0
02:01:34.473 --> 02:01:36.793
So so go right.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22424-0
02:01:34.553 --> 02:01:37.428
The Min Max difference will be
widely varying for datasets

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22424-1
02:01:37.428 --> 02:01:40.547
which have got a high standard
deviation compared to which have

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22424-2
02:01:40.547 --> 02:01:41.863
the low standard deviation.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22427-0
02:01:43.003 --> 02:01:44.093
So code question right?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22434-0
02:01:44.223 --> 02:01:45.733
Why not average right?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22439-0
02:01:45.743 --> 02:01:46.713
Instead of a median here.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22450-0
02:01:48.043 --> 02:01:51.883
Ah, OK, average and median is a
very interesting thing.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22464-0
02:01:51.953 --> 02:01:55.987
The median indicates how many
people are below and how many

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22464-1
02:01:55.987 --> 02:01:57.063
people are able.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22471-0
02:01:57.113 --> 02:01:58.593
So let me let me put.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22488-0
02:01:58.893 --> 02:02:02.989
Let me put another example where
how the suppose that I got

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22488-1
02:02:02.989 --> 02:02:04.423
another organization.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22499-0
02:02:05.153 --> 02:02:09.063
Let me put the age each again.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22513-0
02:02:09.073 --> 02:02:12.671
I'm putting some more people so
so that it is easy for me to

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22513-1
02:02:12.671 --> 02:02:13.143
explain.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22547-0
02:02:21.183 --> 02:02:27.966
And they also have a a centrally
a part time or or a consultant

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22547-1
02:02:27.966 --> 02:02:34.113
who is working and they treat
that person as an employee.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22565-0
02:02:34.123 --> 02:02:38.462
They hide that person for a
special region and that person's

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22565-1
02:02:38.462 --> 02:02:39.173
age is 67.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22574-0
02:02:39.863 --> 02:02:43.153
So now you compute the mean of
this.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22583-0
02:02:43.243 --> 02:02:45.423
So what will be the mean about
40, right?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22592-0
02:02:47.333 --> 02:02:48.603
And what will be the median?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22605-0
02:02:49.703 --> 02:02:51.683
Median is 20 and which is more
reasonable.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22630-0
02:02:53.093 --> 02:02:57.379
So this is this is you make all
this agent out clear the median

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22630-1
02:02:57.379 --> 02:03:00.393
can withstand outliers better
than the mean.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22635-0
02:03:00.563 --> 02:03:02.313
Or does that answer your
question?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22638-0
02:03:03.573 --> 02:03:03.813
OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22673-0
02:03:05.263 --> 02:03:09.228
So that is a that again I think
we will hopefully we will get,

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22673-1
02:03:09.228 --> 02:03:12.879
we'll get, we'll have an
opportunity to discuss that when

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22673-2
02:03:12.879 --> 02:03:16.593
we discuss these statistics
little later in preprocessing.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22679-0
02:03:17.473 --> 02:03:19.033
Are we fine now till now?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22686-0
02:03:19.043 --> 02:03:20.253
What we discussed is clear.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22714-0
02:03:20.443 --> 02:03:24.073
So so I will close the session
and next class we will do a

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22714-1
02:03:24.073 --> 02:03:27.703
quick review of data model and
then we'll proceed further.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22708-0
02:03:24.683 --> 02:03:25.023
Yes, Sir.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22720-0
02:03:29.933 --> 02:03:30.493
Any questions?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22750-0
02:03:34.563 --> 02:03:38.211
So all we are saying is that
data model, this model is better

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22736-0
02:03:35.543 --> 02:03:36.333
Hello, very good.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22748-0
02:03:36.443 --> 02:03:37.643
I'm gonna go out.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22750-1
02:03:38.211 --> 02:03:39.153
than this model.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22776-0
02:03:39.363 --> 02:03:43.565
So we have also to make choice
of model so that we are going to

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22776-1
02:03:43.565 --> 02:03:47.373
get better results with respect
to our data science task.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22781-0
02:03:47.903 --> 02:03:48.433
OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22790-0
02:03:48.443 --> 02:03:50.103
Mr Mahindra, were you trying to
say something?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22798-0
02:03:50.953 --> 02:03:52.313
Funnel and look.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22796-0
02:03:53.073 --> 02:03:53.503
OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22824-0
02:03:53.633 --> 02:03:57.272
Any anyone has any question or
observation OK if there are no

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22824-1
02:03:57.272 --> 02:03:59.913
questions so I'm going to close
the session.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22828-0
02:04:01.973 --> 02:04:02.453
Thank you.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22852-0
02:04:04.313 --> 02:04:04.713
Thank you, Sir.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22861-0
02:04:04.863 --> 02:04:05.883
Hey, thank you so much.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22848-0
02:04:04.943 --> 02:04:05.513
Thank you, Sir.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22857-0
02:04:05.283 --> 02:04:05.773
I I guess so.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22855-0
02:04:05.523 --> 02:04:06.093
Thank you, Sir.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22864-0
02:04:06.263 --> 02:04:06.823
Thank you, Sir.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22879-0
02:04:06.433 --> 02:04:07.033
Thank you so.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22871-0
02:04:06.463 --> 02:04:07.793
Thank you, Sir. Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22875-0
02:04:06.483 --> 02:04:06.773
And then.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22873-0
02:04:06.983 --> 02:04:07.473
Thank you.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22882-0
02:04:07.823 --> 02:04:08.183
Thank you.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22881-0
02:04:07.963 --> 02:04:08.243
Alright.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22885-0
02:04:08.103 --> 02:04:08.583
Thank you, Sir.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22893-0
02:04:10.123 --> 02:04:10.523
Thank you.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22903-0
02:04:10.453 --> 02:04:11.863
So that's the reason.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22919-0
02:04:11.443 --> 02:04:14.589
Yeah, Mr SUMIT Kumar, there is
nothing like we will, we will

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22911-0
02:04:12.613 --> 02:04:13.193
Thank you, Sir.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22919-1
02:04:14.589 --> 02:04:16.653
come to these definitions little
later.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22930-0
02:04:16.663 --> 02:04:19.853
Again, standard deviation
compute and all that.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22928-0
02:04:17.433 --> 02:04:17.853
Thank you, Sir.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22932-0
02:04:19.903 --> 02:04:20.553
So.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22947-0
02:04:21.143 --> 02:04:24.313
So whatever is required for our
course, we will cover.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22950-0
02:04:24.323 --> 02:04:25.423
So don't worry about that.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22989-0
02:04:27.743 --> 02:04:31.628
Is there any way you can get
this type of expression through

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/22989-1
02:04:31.628 --> 02:04:35.003
the example in the real time for
the big three days?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23012-0
02:04:36.863 --> 02:04:40.169
Hi, Mr Mahindra not can you
repeat the question it was

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23012-1
02:04:40.169 --> 02:04:42.213
coming with a lot of noise to
me.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23023-0
02:04:42.223 --> 02:04:43.293
So can you repeat it?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23029-0
02:04:43.833 --> 02:04:45.543
OK, I don't see you get any.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23053-0
02:04:45.603 --> 02:04:48.412
I mean, you get, you get these
type of explanation within the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23053-1
02:04:48.412 --> 02:04:49.273
real time examples.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23084-0
02:04:49.283 --> 02:04:53.241
So on which scenarios is that of
things quickly going to be

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23084-1
02:04:53.241 --> 02:04:55.023
helpful so that it will be?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23098-0
02:04:54.553 --> 02:04:58.410
OK, you are saying when when do
you use the mean and when do you

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23098-1
02:04:58.410 --> 02:04:59.063
use median?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23110-0
02:04:59.073 --> 02:05:00.783
So can I explain that is it?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23120-0
02:05:00.653 --> 02:05:02.563
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23117-0
02:05:00.833 --> 02:05:01.633
Is that what you're saying?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23122-0
02:05:02.483 --> 02:05:02.763
Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23169-0
02:05:02.603 --> 02:05:06.306
Not only for those two, maybe
for any other any other like

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23128-0
02:05:02.773 --> 02:05:03.233
Yeah, we will.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23143-0
02:05:03.283 --> 02:05:04.513
We will explain that really.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23169-1
02:05:06.306 --> 02:05:09.759
standard deviation or the
government discussion, so in

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23161-0
02:05:08.443 --> 02:05:09.793
Yes, yes, yes.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23169-2
02:05:09.759 --> 02:05:10.073
real.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23183-0
02:05:09.863 --> 02:05:13.219
See, The thing is that the
standard deviation is used in

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23183-1
02:05:13.219 --> 02:05:14.573
almost every statistic.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23203-0
02:05:14.663 --> 02:05:17.701
People put some standard
deviation because that is going

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23203-1
02:05:17.701 --> 02:05:20.633
to give an indication of the
distribution of the data.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23225-0
02:05:20.643 --> 02:05:24.171
So standard deviation is
straight away going to tell you

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23225-1
02:05:24.171 --> 02:05:26.833
that when standard deviation is
different.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23244-0
02:05:26.843 --> 02:05:32.028
So suppose that there are two
organizations with millions of

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23244-1
02:05:32.028 --> 02:05:32.793
products.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23277-0
02:05:33.543 --> 02:05:38.056
So now suppose somebody is
selling products bit the this

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23277-1
02:05:38.056 --> 02:05:43.044
type of distribution and another
is selling products with this

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23277-2
02:05:43.044 --> 02:05:44.073
distribution.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23284-0
02:05:44.283 --> 02:05:46.943
This has a low deviation.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23295-0
02:05:47.773 --> 02:05:49.083
This is the high deviation.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23304-0
02:05:49.133 --> 02:05:50.463
So this is what it is telling.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23306-0
02:05:49.713 --> 02:05:49.903
Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23361-0
02:05:50.803 --> 02:05:54.320
So, Mr Mahindra, this is that
clear, so both of them may be

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23361-1
02:05:54.320 --> 02:05:57.721
making the same amount of
turnover, but then you can know

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23361-2
02:05:57.721 --> 02:06:01.062
you can make out and how that
helps is a really a domain

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23354-0
02:05:58.963 --> 02:05:59.673
Which one is better?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23361-3
02:06:01.062 --> 02:06:01.883
related issue.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23384-0
02:06:01.953 --> 02:06:05.366
Somebody is working with a low
deviation type of product and

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23384-1
02:06:05.366 --> 02:06:08.163
somebody is having a product
with high deviation.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23408-0
02:06:08.553 --> 02:06:12.265
So somebody is selling a car
with a price range from 5,00,000

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23408-1
02:06:12.265 --> 02:06:13.043
to 30,00,000.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23427-0
02:06:13.413 --> 02:06:16.080
Another person is selling most
of the products which are

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23427-1
02:06:16.080 --> 02:06:17.203
between 15 to 18,00,000.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23436-0
02:06:17.213 --> 02:06:18.953
So how does it make a
difference?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23472-0
02:06:18.963 --> 02:06:22.511
So they can depend where widely
depending on the domain

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23472-1
02:06:22.511 --> 02:06:26.249
situations, but then we can make
that observation based on

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23465-0
02:06:24.133 --> 02:06:24.333
Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23472-2
02:06:26.249 --> 02:06:27.453
standard deviation.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23522-0
02:06:29.003 --> 02:06:33.849
Got it under Amit, since for
this course statistics is the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23522-1
02:06:33.849 --> 02:06:38.777
base, so are we going to get in
December for the statistics

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23522-2
02:06:38.777 --> 02:06:39.763
sports also?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23512-0
02:06:39.603 --> 02:06:39.933
Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23534-0
02:06:39.943 --> 02:06:42.712
Yeah, a little bit of a disc,
whatever statistics related

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23534-1
02:06:42.712 --> 02:06:44.813
requirements are there, we will
cover that.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23542-0
02:06:44.823 --> 02:06:47.583
So they we don't require really
very major.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23558-0
02:06:49.023 --> 02:06:53.646
Understanding, but wherever the
little bit is required, how to

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23558-1
02:06:53.646 --> 02:06:54.673
define a mean?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23564-0
02:06:54.683 --> 02:06:55.813
How to define a median?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23570-0
02:06:55.823 --> 02:06:56.933
How to define a mode?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23596-0
02:06:56.943 --> 02:07:00.871
How to define define all that we
are going to discuss that we are

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23596-1
02:07:00.871 --> 02:07:01.883
going to discuss.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23622-0
02:07:02.923 --> 02:07:06.823
OK, so is this the subject is
entirely theoretical level even

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23622-1
02:07:06.823 --> 02:07:09.213
in laptop, but anything can be
there.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23628-0
02:07:09.623 --> 02:07:12.133
Now you have to help me
understand what is theory.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23632-0
02:07:12.143 --> 02:07:12.913
What is practice?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23640-0
02:07:12.923 --> 02:07:14.013
So what are we doing till now?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23660-0
02:07:15.493 --> 02:07:18.773
No, haven't got understanding
the basic concepts of the

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23660-1
02:07:18.773 --> 02:07:19.183
things.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23668-0
02:07:20.043 --> 02:07:20.643
Dokey.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23696-0
02:07:20.863 --> 02:07:25.193
So supposed to suppose that I
asked you what is the mean age

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23686-0
02:07:21.103 --> 02:07:22.893
That doesn't severely gives me
but.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23696-1
02:07:25.193 --> 02:07:26.613
of some set of data.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23714-0
02:07:26.763 --> 02:07:30.271
So do you call that as a theory
or practice or I don't know what

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23714-1
02:07:30.271 --> 02:07:30.433
is?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23727-0
02:07:32.523 --> 02:07:34.893
So you want to learn Python or
or or or?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23750-0
02:07:34.903 --> 02:07:37.854
Is that what you are saying or
you are so you have something

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23744-0
02:07:36.433 --> 02:07:36.653
Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23750-1
02:07:37.854 --> 02:07:38.483
else in mind?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23762-0
02:07:38.983 --> 02:07:40.073
No, that one only.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23780-0
02:07:40.623 --> 02:07:43.313
OK the how to implement that
using given a data.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23794-0
02:07:40.843 --> 02:07:43.493
So in this seven one, are we
going to get that into the?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23783-0
02:07:43.323 --> 02:07:43.963
How to do that?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23785-0
02:07:43.973 --> 02:07:44.173
Yeah.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23789-0
02:07:44.183 --> 02:07:44.613
Yeah, we will.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23799-0
02:07:44.623 --> 02:07:45.493
We will come to that.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23808-0
02:07:45.713 --> 02:07:48.333
So hopefully in we will have
some webinars.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23826-0
02:07:48.743 --> 02:07:53.027
So where we will give you some
introduction to using Python for

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23826-1
02:07:53.027 --> 02:07:55.103
solving some of these problems?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23832-0
02:07:55.113 --> 02:07:56.323
Yes, we will come there.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23833-0
02:07:57.363 --> 02:07:57.643
OK.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23848-0
02:08:01.223 --> 02:08:01.603
Next.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23853-0
02:08:02.623 --> 02:08:05.703
Alright, so I think I stopped
recording right?

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23869-0
02:08:06.873 --> 02:08:07.713
I don't think so.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23860-0
02:08:06.993 --> 02:08:08.223
Yeah, I stopped recording.

7b41cc5c-7e3b-4b75-ac4a-c32c2f77e0d9/23878-0
02:08:08.233 --> 02:08:11.213
OK, so the last few minutes what
