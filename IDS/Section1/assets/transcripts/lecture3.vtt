571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/131-0
00:00:11.739 --> 00:00:17.809
So we were looking at the how do
we model the data.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/135-0
00:00:17.879 --> 00:00:19.669
So that is our question.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/175-0
00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:25.260
So in fact, what we have seen is
that there is a data and we need

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/175-1
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.711
to find the patterns and there
can be various types of

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/175-2
00:00:29.711 --> 00:00:30.439
patterns.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/201-0
00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:37.134
We have seen the pattern for the
classification and clustering

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/201-1
00:00:37.134 --> 00:00:40.319
association and normally et
cetera.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/255-0
00:00:41.349 --> 00:00:45.931
And we have seen that those
patterns are possible when we

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/255-1
00:00:45.931 --> 00:00:50.907
understand the data and we model
the relations within the data

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/255-2
00:00:50.907 --> 00:00:55.646
and then we will be able to, uh,
find the patterns and then

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/255-3
00:00:55.646 --> 00:00:59.359
measure the quality of the
patterns and so on.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/284-0
00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.823
Now the question is that first
thing that we need to do is that

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/284-1
00:01:04.823 --> 00:01:07.759
we need to have an understanding
of the data.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/294-0
00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:11.929
So so is it always an easy job?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/333-0
00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:18.314
So we were looking at the
factors like the data science

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/333-1
00:01:18.314 --> 00:01:25.487
has an element of art and and it
also has the has the constant

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/333-2
00:01:25.487 --> 00:01:29.699
iterative ways of looking at
things.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/341-0
00:01:30.059 --> 00:01:32.379
So we will look at it from 2
perspective.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/377-0
00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:36.628
One is that the data perspective
and the other one after the data

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/377-1
00:01:36.628 --> 00:01:40.545
perspective, we will also look
at the hypothesis perspective

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/377-2
00:01:40.545 --> 00:01:43.949
saying that how can we be sure
of our understanding.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/396-0
00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:50.108
So so one way in which we would
like to understand the data is

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/396-1
00:01:50.108 --> 00:01:51.999
through the statistics.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/407-0
00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:56.019
So what do these statistics tell
you?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/422-0
00:01:56.029 --> 00:02:00.981
Statistics gives you many
images, so statistics tells you

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/422-1
00:02:00.981 --> 00:02:02.859
that what is the mean?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/426-0
00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.119
What is the median?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/432-0
00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:05.679
What is the standard deviation?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/437-0
00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:07.719
What is the minimum?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/460-0
00:02:07.769 --> 00:02:12.545
What is the maximum and then it
can tell you a various

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/460-1
00:02:12.545 --> 00:02:16.019
quartiles, various various
percentiles.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/490-0
00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:22.143
Uh, so there is a there are many
things that you can get from

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/490-1
00:02:22.143 --> 00:02:25.559
about the data by using these
statistics.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/498-0
00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.849
So statistics is a form of
summarizing the data, right?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/520-0
00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:33.731
So so you you want to look at 5
people and say that this person

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/520-1
00:02:33.731 --> 00:02:35.629
is the tallest among them.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/533-0
00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:38.889
So in a way you are trying to
describe them.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/559-0
00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:42.108
I mean that though that
description value is always

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/559-1
00:02:42.108 --> 00:02:45.946
questionable, but then you can
always say that, OK, this among

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/559-2
00:02:45.946 --> 00:02:48.079
these people, this is the
tallest.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/570-0
00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:50.669
This is the shortest and this is
the average and so on.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/609-0
00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.625
So, so so the looking at the
data and describing with the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/609-1
00:02:58.625 --> 00:03:03.384
help of statistics is always
something that we would like to

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/609-2
00:03:03.384 --> 00:03:05.179
do when given the data.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/614-0
00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:08.423
And that summarization is
represents some form of

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/614-1
00:03:08.423 --> 00:03:09.329
understanding.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/635-0
00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:17.268
So now let us go further and let
us see what happens when we get

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/635-1
00:03:17.268 --> 00:03:18.079
a data.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/667-0
00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:23.578
And ohh and this is the data
that we were looking at, this

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/667-1
00:03:23.578 --> 00:03:28.545
data is representing the amount
of price that the customers are

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/667-2
00:03:28.545 --> 00:03:31.029
willing to pay for your product.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/701-0
00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:35.116
This is something I think many
companies will be willing to

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/701-1
00:03:35.116 --> 00:03:39.192
study the market and do the
market analysis and that is the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/701-2
00:03:39.192 --> 00:03:42.589
way they can be sure that their
product will set.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/724-0
00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:50.036
Now the question is question is
that you need to understand the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/724-1
00:03:50.036 --> 00:03:51.769
patterns within the data.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/747-0
00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:57.956
So one of the common ways in
which people tend to look at the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/747-1
00:03:57.956 --> 00:03:59.489
data is in infective.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/764-0
00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:02.578
It's one of the very popular
distributions that is called

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/764-1
00:04:02.578 --> 00:04:03.639
normal distribution.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/805-0
00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:07.858
It's also called Gaussian
distribution, so this normal or

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/805-1
00:04:07.858 --> 00:04:12.136
Gaussian distribution assumes
that there is a mean and there

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/805-2
00:04:12.136 --> 00:04:16.415
is a balanced spread across the
mean, so that is what is the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/805-3
00:04:16.415 --> 00:04:18.169
description for the data.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/834-0
00:04:18.869 --> 00:04:26.009
So now we have got this data
that is there in this at slide

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/834-1
00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:31.839
and we I can also put it in the
the spreadsheet.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/846-0
00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:35.169
I hope you are able to speed the
see the spreadsheet though.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/851-0
00:04:35.769 --> 00:04:36.729
We had to make it a little.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/865-0
00:04:38.989 --> 00:04:40.829
To fit it into one piece, I need
to to.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/895-0
00:04:41.309 --> 00:04:47.380
OK, so so now you can see that
when you we try to break up and

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/895-1
00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:53.259
plot a histogram with this data,
this is what it looks like.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/959-0
00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:57.458
This is what it looks like the
mean is coming to 17 point

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/959-1
00:04:57.458 --> 00:05:01.126
something and the standard
deviation for the assuming the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/959-2
00:05:01.126 --> 00:05:04.921
entire population is coming as
9.88 and if you take it as a

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/959-3
00:05:04.921 --> 00:05:09.032
sample it is coming as 10.1 for
these are all the functions that

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/959-4
00:05:09.032 --> 00:05:11.499
are available within the within
Excel.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/971-0
00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:15.369
So so we can describe the data
this way.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1018-0
00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:20.474
But now now the question will be
that if we assume which many

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1018-1
00:05:20.474 --> 00:05:25.244
times we assume that even random
data with random distribution

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/993-0
00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:24.869
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1018-2
00:05:25.244 --> 00:05:29.787
uh, we have a tendency to assume
that it follows a Gaussian

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1018-3
00:05:29.787 --> 00:05:31.529
pattern normal pattern.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1034-0
00:05:32.109 --> 00:05:35.668
But when we follow the normal
pattern, assume the normal

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1034-1
00:05:35.668 --> 00:05:37.479
pattern and this is the data.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1050-0
00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:43.034
This doesn't seem to be so good
because the normal pattern would

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1050-1
00:05:43.034 --> 00:05:44.079
have liked a.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1059-0
00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:46.389
Histogram of this type.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1073-0
00:05:47.109 --> 00:05:50.066
But the histogram that we got
with the data that we observed

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1073-1
00:05:50.066 --> 00:05:50.939
is very different.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1123-0
00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:57.038
And and we can also see that
once we assume a normal pattern

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1123-1
00:05:57.038 --> 00:06:00.814
normal distribution, we are also
seeing that there are some

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1123-2
00:06:00.814 --> 00:06:04.653
negative values because the mean
is 17 and then the standard

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1123-3
00:06:04.653 --> 00:06:05.849
deviation is 10.93.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1134-0
00:06:05.859 --> 00:06:08.453
So 2 standard deviations is
straight away, putting it into

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1134-1
00:06:08.453 --> 00:06:08.849
negative.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1154-0
00:06:09.179 --> 00:06:12.229
So there will be significant
values that are supposed to be

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1154-1
00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:14.109
negative, yes, but the
distribution.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1163-0
00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:16.419
But as per our sample it is not.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1202-0
00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:21.075
So we need to start thinking
about what is a good

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1202-1
00:06:21.075 --> 00:06:24.948
distribution that can possibly
give us some better

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1202-2
00:06:24.948 --> 00:06:29.959
representation for the data that
we have and that is not really a

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1202-3
00:06:29.959 --> 00:06:32.009
trivial job or an easy job.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1253-0
00:06:32.369 --> 00:06:35.805
So but but there are many, but
you are also going to have a

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1253-1
00:06:35.805 --> 00:06:39.413
course on, I think statistical
methods or you are you going to

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1253-2
00:06:39.413 --> 00:06:43.021
have a mathematics you're going
to have as it is a mathematics

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1253-3
00:06:43.021 --> 00:06:45.369
course and possibly a statistics
course.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1290-0
00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:49.976
So the now the point is if we
are thinking about a given a

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1290-1
00:06:49.976 --> 00:06:54.513
data and we want to fit in a
distribution, I'm going into the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1290-2
00:06:54.513 --> 00:06:57.659
website of a professor of Iowa
University.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1310-0
00:06:58.129 --> 00:07:03.192
So he's he has made a convenient
applet whereby we can simulate a

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1310-1
00:07:03.192 --> 00:07:04.879
distribution to scene.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1345-0
00:07:05.149 --> 00:07:08.788
So now we are going into a gamma
distribution to see whether we

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1345-1
00:07:08.788 --> 00:07:12.200
will be able to fit in the data
with the help of this gamma

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1345-2
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:12.939
distribution.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1397-0
00:07:13.109 --> 00:07:19.242
So now we are talking about a
data which has got a standard

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1397-1
00:07:19.242 --> 00:07:25.681
deviation that is running into
ohh 10 and the mean of 17.2 and

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1397-2
00:07:25.681 --> 00:07:31.098
so if we are trying out
something which is let's say

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1397-3
00:07:31.098 --> 00:07:33.449
4.54, I'm going to get.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1428-0
00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:40.559
Something which is close because
which is peaking around 10 near

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1428-1
00:07:40.559 --> 00:07:44.914
near about 10 and and I'm trying
to see what is the possible

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1428-2
00:07:44.914 --> 00:07:45.699
percentage.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1474-0
00:07:45.759 --> 00:07:51.565
So about 10% of the items which
are above 30 and below 30 below

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1474-1
00:07:51.565 --> 00:07:56.737
0, there is no item below 0 is a
0%, so it's essentially

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1459-0
00:07:54.029 --> 00:07:54.219
Yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1474-2
00:07:56.737 --> 00:07:59.549
everything is about about 0 uh.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1492-0
00:07:59.609 --> 00:08:04.079
Everything is about 0 and then
above 30 it is best 10%.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1503-0
00:08:04.169 --> 00:08:07.559
So it is possible that this can
be a better distribution.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1531-0
00:08:07.849 --> 00:08:11.146
So now the question is that what
is the formula by which I can

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1531-1
00:08:11.146 --> 00:08:13.659
say that reject some
distribution and the other

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1531-2
00:08:13.659 --> 00:08:14.339
distribution?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1552-0
00:08:14.569 --> 00:08:17.790
There is no easy answer because
we may have to do a lot of

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1552-1
00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:19.319
understanding of their data.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1575-0
00:08:20.269 --> 00:08:23.325
The reason is that these two
distributions are going to give

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1575-1
00:08:23.325 --> 00:08:25.679
you a different probability
density functions.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1589-0
00:08:25.279 --> 00:08:25.679
What?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1584-0
00:08:26.529 --> 00:08:28.939
Uh, OK, somebody is making a
saying something.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1591-0
00:08:34.749 --> 00:08:36.419
Uh, it also can.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1595-0
00:08:37.319 --> 00:08:38.659
I'm Ketan here.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1611-0
00:08:38.769 --> 00:08:43.694
I was not able to attend the
last Lecture till the last uh,

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1611-1
00:08:43.694 --> 00:08:44.269
minute.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1640-0
00:08:44.859 --> 00:08:48.770
Can I just get a brief about
what kind of distributions are

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1640-1
00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:52.420
we talking about and what
exactly standard deviation is

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1640-2
00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:53.919
being used to work out?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1646-0
00:08:54.439 --> 00:08:57.039
Uh, Mr Ketan, I'm.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1664-0
00:08:57.299 --> 00:09:02.168
If you don't say I'm rude, you
have not attended the previous

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1664-1
00:09:02.168 --> 00:09:03.189
class I have.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1689-0
00:09:03.279 --> 00:09:06.508
I can see there can be so many
things, so many things, but have

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1681-0
00:09:03.639 --> 00:09:04.529
That till the last.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1689-1
00:09:06.508 --> 00:09:07.719
you reviewed the slides?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1700-0
00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:11.509
Yeah, I know on a high level
too.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1716-0
00:09:11.609 --> 00:09:13.589
No, not interested.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1729-0
00:09:12.629 --> 00:09:15.598
I do not know if you have
reviewed it, reviewed it to you,

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1729-1
00:09:15.598 --> 00:09:17.459
may have got an idea already,
right?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1752-0
00:09:17.509 --> 00:09:19.519
Or or you didn't go through the
review?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1747-0
00:09:18.119 --> 00:09:19.469
Umm, yeah yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1756-0
00:09:19.539 --> 00:09:20.849
A basic idea. Yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1769-0
00:09:20.859 --> 00:09:21.839
Basic idea, yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1754-0
00:09:21.099 --> 00:09:21.299
No.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1758-0
00:09:21.309 --> 00:09:21.579
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1763-0
00:09:21.619 --> 00:09:22.409
OK, OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1765-0
00:09:22.419 --> 00:09:22.889
So.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1783-0
00:09:22.899 --> 00:09:26.043
So the point is, we did not look
at any distributions in the last

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1783-1
00:09:26.043 --> 00:09:26.329
class.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1803-0
00:09:26.659 --> 00:09:29.215
So we have, we have again we
were talking about the same

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1803-1
00:09:29.215 --> 00:09:30.829
topic, then we ran out of the
time.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1813-0
00:09:30.839 --> 00:09:32.249
So that is why we are reviewing
it.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1852-0
00:09:32.699 --> 00:09:36.519
So we have seen the same sample
in the last class and what we

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1852-1
00:09:36.519 --> 00:09:39.847
had said is that, yes, if we try
to fit into Gaussian

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1852-2
00:09:39.847 --> 00:09:42.989
distribution, so we are going to
run into trouble.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1867-0
00:09:43.159 --> 00:09:45.829
So Gaussian distribution in
detail the mathematics of that.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1901-0
00:09:45.839 --> 00:09:49.424
We are not going to go into it,
so Gaussian distribution is a

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1901-1
00:09:49.424 --> 00:09:53.008
probability density function, so
that is going to give you an

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1901-2
00:09:53.008 --> 00:09:55.899
indication of the probability
for various values.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1927-0
00:09:56.209 --> 00:10:00.910
So it looks like maybe I can
show another slide which is

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1927-1
00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:03.219
which is giving a friend to.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1931-0
00:10:03.229 --> 00:10:03.929
What is the?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1940-0
00:10:04.009 --> 00:10:06.439
What is the Gaussian
distribution is like?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1965-0
00:10:06.749 --> 00:10:10.558
So there is a mean around which
there is a distribution and

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1965-1
00:10:10.558 --> 00:10:14.304
there is a standard deviation
and typically the the normal

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/1965-2
00:10:14.304 --> 00:10:15.129
distribution.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2001-0
00:10:15.139 --> 00:10:19.103
These are all the standard
figures, so when you assume a

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2001-1
00:10:19.103 --> 00:10:22.511
mean and standard deviation
normal, the Gaussian

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2001-2
00:10:22.511 --> 00:10:26.962
distribution says that 94% data
will be within Sigma +2 Sigma 2

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2001-3
00:10:26.962 --> 00:10:27.379
Sigma.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2045-0
00:10:27.589 --> 00:10:32.516
Sorry, MU minus 2 Sigma to MU +2
Sigma so 94% data will be within

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2045-1
00:10:32.516 --> 00:10:37.070
that range and when you say
minus Sigma to MU the Sigma that

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2045-2
00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:39.459
is a 68% data within that range.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2056-0
00:10:39.829 --> 00:10:43.019
So this is a distribution which
is used very commonly.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2099-0
00:10:43.349 --> 00:10:47.378
It's one of the most popular
distributions when we have a

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2099-1
00:10:47.378 --> 00:10:51.823
random data that is for which we
got some sample or we got some

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2099-2
00:10:51.823 --> 00:10:55.990
numbers but no no amount of data
is going to give you exact

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2099-3
00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:57.449
distribution network.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2127-0
00:10:58.119 --> 00:11:01.133
So you need to make an
assumption and many times people

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2127-1
00:11:01.133 --> 00:11:04.470
make the assumption that there
is a uniform variation on both

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2127-2
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:05.439
sides of the mean.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2138-0
00:11:06.279 --> 00:11:08.029
So so this is a.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2157-0
00:11:08.069 --> 00:11:11.293
So if we go with that
assumption, what we have seen is

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2157-1
00:11:11.293 --> 00:11:13.989
that with this sample it is not
working well.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2178-0
00:11:14.379 --> 00:11:17.280
So if it is not working well,
first thing is that the sample

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2178-1
00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.469
size itself is too small.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2218-0
00:11:18.759 --> 00:11:22.284
So we we make question ourselves
whether this sample size is

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2218-1
00:11:22.284 --> 00:11:25.693
reasonable or we may just have
to start look for alternate

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2218-2
00:11:25.693 --> 00:11:28.640
distributions, alternate
distributions that try to

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2218-3
00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:31.009
capture the mean and standard
deviation.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2234-0
00:11:31.019 --> 00:11:33.770
But at the same time, they're
going to give you a different

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2234-1
00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:34.779
type of distributions.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2247-0
00:11:35.169 --> 00:11:39.319
So this is these are all called
skewed distributions.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2284-0
00:11:39.369 --> 00:11:43.428
Normal distribution is called a
balanced distribution, which is

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2284-1
00:11:43.428 --> 00:11:47.488
a balanced on both sides of the
mean, but most of the data that

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2284-2
00:11:47.488 --> 00:11:50.659
the data that we see will be
skewed distribution.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2295-0
00:11:50.869 --> 00:11:53.289
Can somebody give me an example
of a skewed distribution?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2311-0
00:11:57.029 --> 00:11:59.989
Can somebody give me an example
of a skewed distribution?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2349-0
00:12:07.299 --> 00:12:11.380
If most of the data like falling
under the same range, then it is

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2343-0
00:12:10.319 --> 00:12:12.249
Yes, yes, I'm asking for one
example.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2342-0
00:12:10.359 --> 00:12:10.679
Yep.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2349-1
00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:11.689
good.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2373-0
00:12:12.359 --> 00:12:15.326
One example from your website
instead of my side, why not you

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2373-1
00:12:15.326 --> 00:12:17.049
someone one of you give an
example.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2379-0
00:12:18.209 --> 00:12:19.069
Reason distribution.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2388-0
00:12:20.199 --> 00:12:22.849
Why do you bring bring another
name to confuse others?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2402-0
00:12:22.859 --> 00:12:24.799
Maybe you know the Poisson
distribution, yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2406-0
00:12:24.279 --> 00:12:26.519
But Bob listens of country.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2412-0
00:12:27.659 --> 00:12:28.969
Uh, I'm sorry.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2422-0
00:12:28.979 --> 00:12:29.969
Can one of you speak now?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2430-0
00:12:30.569 --> 00:12:33.379
Medical data during the COVID
time.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2429-0
00:12:31.089 --> 00:12:32.209
Income distribution.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2435-0
00:12:35.409 --> 00:12:35.849
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2442-0
00:12:35.909 --> 00:12:37.979
What is that during the COVID
time?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2451-0
00:12:37.989 --> 00:12:39.529
What is the data you're talking
about?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2480-0
00:12:40.949 --> 00:12:47.973
Ohh you can just the talk about
the mortality rate during the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2480-1
00:12:47.973 --> 00:12:49.219
COVID time.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2471-0
00:12:48.369 --> 00:12:48.819
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2474-0
00:12:48.969 --> 00:12:49.739
OK, fine.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2477-0
00:12:49.809 --> 00:12:50.379
OK, fine.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2483-0
00:12:50.389 --> 00:12:51.399
Thank you, Mr Dinkar.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2505-0
00:12:51.409 --> 00:12:53.419
Any anyone has any more simpler
examples?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2510-0
00:12:52.569 --> 00:12:55.219
The the real real estate price.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2511-0
00:12:54.019 --> 00:12:55.419
Uh income distribution, Sir.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2513-0
00:12:55.999 --> 00:12:56.229
Some.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2516-0
00:12:56.539 --> 00:12:58.029
Real estate price.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2520-0
00:12:58.079 --> 00:12:58.489
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2527-0
00:12:58.539 --> 00:12:59.709
Real estate price.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2529-0
00:12:59.759 --> 00:13:00.219
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2540-0
00:12:59.839 --> 00:13:02.059
So, so, so say for example.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2541-0
00:13:00.579 --> 00:13:02.909
How is it going to show a skewed
distribution?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2555-0
00:13:05.929 --> 00:13:07.369
Ms I'm sorry.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2565-0
00:13:06.759 --> 00:13:10.985
Ohh yes, Mr Jagdish has got a
very interesting yes income or

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2565-1
00:13:10.985 --> 00:13:11.609
salaries.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2574-0
00:13:11.619 --> 00:13:13.339
It is certainly a skewed
distribution, right?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2624-0
00:13:14.739 --> 00:13:19.686
Because when you start, there is
no negative income and it starts

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2624-1
00:13:19.686 --> 00:13:24.258
with zero or maybe very small
number and once you go to some

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2624-2
00:13:24.258 --> 00:13:29.055
big numbers saying that how many
people got an income more than

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2624-3
00:13:29.055 --> 00:13:29.879
100 crores.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2660-0
00:13:30.059 --> 00:13:33.485
So you will say that it is
countable and, but then if you

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2660-1
00:13:33.485 --> 00:13:37.324
look at the people who how many
people got income around 20,000,

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2660-2
00:13:37.324 --> 00:13:39.509
you are going to get a large
number.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2668-0
00:13:39.979 --> 00:13:41.569
Yes, it is a skewed
distribution.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2684-0
00:13:41.579 --> 00:13:46.029
So as the values increase, it
has a very long positive tail.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2690-0
00:13:46.619 --> 00:13:48.429
On the positive side, very long
tail.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2695-0
00:13:48.639 --> 00:13:49.709
Yes, Mr reject this.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2699-0
00:13:49.719 --> 00:13:50.109
Thank you.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2704-0
00:13:50.189 --> 00:13:51.189
That is a very good example.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2722-0
00:13:53.549 --> 00:13:57.329
So so any anything else that
people can think of?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2729-0
00:13:58.419 --> 00:13:59.569
Populations with countries.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2733-0
00:13:59.429 --> 00:14:01.099
Population distribution.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2738-0
00:14:01.149 --> 00:14:03.149
Yeah, yes, same thing.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2754-0
00:14:01.739 --> 00:14:06.241
Yes, yes, yes, I'm Mr, I think
two people, Mr Patra and Mr

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2747-0
00:14:03.159 --> 00:14:03.539
Yeah. Yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2754-1
00:14:06.241 --> 00:14:06.699
Sound.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2766-0
00:14:06.739 --> 00:14:08.989
Miss Soundarya, they are saying
yes, yes, that is good.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2784-0
00:14:09.099 --> 00:14:11.806
So can you explain how the
population distribution is

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2784-1
00:14:11.806 --> 00:14:12.809
skewed distribution?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2798-0
00:14:12.999 --> 00:14:13.729
One of you can take.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2792-0
00:14:13.589 --> 00:14:14.099
Yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2837-0
00:14:14.219 --> 00:14:18.085
You in case of you know highly
populated like China and India,

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2837-1
00:14:18.085 --> 00:14:21.889
it is quite high and and if we
go with the smaller countries.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2823-0
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.899
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2832-0
00:14:20.909 --> 00:14:22.839
OK, Mr Mr. Mr Patra.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2834-0
00:14:22.849 --> 00:14:23.059
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2840-0
00:14:23.069 --> 00:14:23.759
OK, hold it.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2855-0
00:14:23.809 --> 00:14:26.416
Miss Soundarya, do you want to
explain how the population has

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2855-1
00:14:26.416 --> 00:14:27.509
got a skewed distribution?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2872-0
00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:31.739
That's all published as usual,
like.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2909-0
00:14:31.749 --> 00:14:38.240
It also has a positive trail
with respect to yeah, that,

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2895-0
00:14:35.519 --> 00:14:37.829
Positive daily, yes, yes, yes.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2905-0
00:14:37.189 --> 00:14:37.509
But then.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2902-0
00:14:38.119 --> 00:14:39.079
How do you explain it?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2909-1
00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:38.809
yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2921-0
00:14:38.899 --> 00:14:42.059
And it will not be mean negative
side.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2913-0
00:14:39.089 --> 00:14:39.389
How do you?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2917-0
00:14:40.419 --> 00:14:40.639
So.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2928-0
00:14:42.619 --> 00:14:43.439
Yes, yes.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2956-0
00:14:43.569 --> 00:14:46.901
The economically stronger areas
you tend to, you know, like a

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2956-1
00:14:46.901 --> 00:14:49.749
skew the population there with
higher density there.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2952-0
00:14:49.169 --> 00:14:50.159
No, no, Mr Rajesh.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2957-0
00:14:50.169 --> 00:14:50.739
Just wait.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2961-0
00:14:50.749 --> 00:14:51.759
Mr Rajesh, just wait.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2973-0
00:14:51.769 --> 00:14:53.569
Miss Soundarya, do you want to
explain it for me?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2997-0
00:14:52.589 --> 00:14:52.749
It's.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2984-0
00:14:53.949 --> 00:14:55.729
I think he had her explanation.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/2996-0
00:14:55.739 --> 00:14:58.539
I have liked it so far, so can
you go further, Miss Soundarya?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3000-0
00:15:01.029 --> 00:15:01.639
Uh.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3013-0
00:15:01.689 --> 00:15:04.639
See for example with respect to
Indian states.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3026-0
00:15:04.649 --> 00:15:09.558
If I explain, there will be very
less population in a state

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3026-1
00:15:09.558 --> 00:15:10.049
which.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3062-0
00:15:12.279 --> 00:15:16.599
Compared to the other states, so
we we'll have a, yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3050-0
00:15:15.239 --> 00:15:16.249
We'll, we'll be OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3052-0
00:15:16.259 --> 00:15:16.789
Miss under.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3054-0
00:15:16.799 --> 00:15:17.129
Yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3059-0
00:15:17.229 --> 00:15:17.609
No, no.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3074-0
00:15:17.619 --> 00:15:19.602
You are saying that no, I
thought actually you were

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3074-1
00:15:19.602 --> 00:15:19.869
saying.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3078-0
00:15:19.879 --> 00:15:21.569
It is a long positive tail.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3086-0
00:15:21.839 --> 00:15:23.809
It is really explaining this.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3084-0
00:15:21.959 --> 00:15:22.139
Yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3114-0
00:15:23.819 --> 00:15:28.596
Let me put let let me draw
population, maybe population if

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3114-1
00:15:28.596 --> 00:15:33.049
I want to represent it, it will
be somewhat like this.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3124-0
00:15:33.419 --> 00:15:37.579
It will be somewhat if I
represent the population.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3141-0
00:15:37.699 --> 00:15:42.209
Let's say this is the 100 years
and this is the 80 years.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3150-0
00:15:42.819 --> 00:15:46.169
So the population will be
somewhat like or maybe the.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3163-0
00:15:50.529 --> 00:15:52.379
There will be about 120 years.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3183-0
00:15:52.389 --> 00:15:56.743
I think there is only one person
so but then as it goes down

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3183-1
00:15:56.743 --> 00:15:58.599
there is a very long tail.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3211-0
00:15:58.849 --> 00:16:02.635
But then for a mortality is very
high at around 70 or I think I

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3211-1
00:16:02.635 --> 00:16:05.179
for India, there will be a
different rate.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3228-0
00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:07.940
And even I think across the
regions in India also there is a

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3228-1
00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:09.079
variation, some variation.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3236-0
00:16:09.209 --> 00:16:11.499
There's certainly the variation
is among the countries.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3282-0
00:16:11.789 --> 00:16:16.036
So now what you can see is that
the population will be when you

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3248-0
00:16:12.629 --> 00:16:12.849
Let's.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3282-1
00:16:16.036 --> 00:16:20.284
once you reach some number, it
is almost zero, but then it is a

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3282-2
00:16:20.284 --> 00:16:21.279
very long tail.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3299-0
00:16:21.429 --> 00:16:24.649
So I thought that is what Miss
Sounder you were saying.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3288-0
00:16:21.459 --> 00:16:21.889
I'd love to.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3318-0
00:16:24.779 --> 00:16:27.505
But when she talked about long
tail, but I don't know how you

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3318-1
00:16:27.505 --> 00:16:29.219
will explain long tail in
another way.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3325-0
00:16:29.709 --> 00:16:31.249
Umm, it's missing that.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3328-0
00:16:31.259 --> 00:16:31.399
Yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3342-0
00:16:31.409 --> 00:16:33.729
What is the other way you're
trying to explain a long tail?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3350-0
00:16:33.739 --> 00:16:35.339
What is the tail coming with?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3363-0
00:16:35.349 --> 00:16:37.169
What is your X axis and what is
your Y axis?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3366-0
00:16:38.199 --> 00:16:38.649
Uh.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3378-0
00:16:38.999 --> 00:16:40.599
With respect to states.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3375-0
00:16:41.169 --> 00:16:41.559
No, no.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3382-0
00:16:41.569 --> 00:16:42.829
Tell me X axis and Y axis.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3407-0
00:16:45.019 --> 00:16:46.789
Execs is and YX's and the.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3420-0
00:16:46.249 --> 00:16:48.785
Because it is a long and you are
plotting a distribution then

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3420-1
00:16:48.785 --> 00:16:50.299
only you will get a tail, is it
not?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3440-0
00:16:51.799 --> 00:16:54.345
When you, when you are plotting
a distribution, only you are

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3440-1
00:16:54.345 --> 00:16:55.389
going to get a long tail.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3444-0
00:16:55.539 --> 00:16:55.979
Is it not?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3479-0
00:16:58.009 --> 00:17:03.279
Yes, but with years, as you
explained, we'll get that most.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3461-0
00:16:58.709 --> 00:16:59.979
If you're plotting a histogram.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3465-0
00:17:01.689 --> 00:17:01.999
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3475-0
00:17:02.009 --> 00:17:03.479
OK, Miss Andrea, that is fine.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3494-0
00:17:03.289 --> 00:17:05.419
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3489-0
00:17:03.489 --> 00:17:05.669
I I think I think fine that is
fine.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3509-0
00:17:06.029 --> 00:17:08.719
OK, somebody else also wanted to
explain something else.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3529-0
00:17:06.849 --> 00:17:10.299
No, but that but that.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3535-0
00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:11.459
Uh tax regime can be the
example.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3528-0
00:17:09.549 --> 00:17:10.299
Age of retirement.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3541-0
00:17:09.739 --> 00:17:13.873
Number of World Cup Game World
Cup games winning by Indian team

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3541-1
00:17:13.873 --> 00:17:14.519
this year.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3566-0
00:17:15.639 --> 00:17:19.119
OK, I don't know how what is the
aircraft is what is the Y axis.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3561-0
00:17:16.469 --> 00:17:17.089
That, that, that.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3562-0
00:17:16.769 --> 00:17:17.109
Tax.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3568-0
00:17:18.139 --> 00:17:18.339
But.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3586-0
00:17:19.169 --> 00:17:22.577
So because you are saying that
you will make a plot and it will

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3586-1
00:17:22.577 --> 00:17:23.429
get a long tail.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3599-0
00:17:24.519 --> 00:17:26.539
So tax regime can be the
examples.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3596-0
00:17:27.089 --> 00:17:27.639
Yes, yes.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3604-0
00:17:27.649 --> 00:17:28.839
So the tax, yes.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3615-0
00:17:28.849 --> 00:17:31.519
OK, the people who pay high tax
will be very few.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3624-0
00:17:31.649 --> 00:17:33.129
Is that what you are saying, Mr
Devendra?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3645-0
00:17:33.949 --> 00:17:38.114
Alright, so we have a different
no, the even even we have a tax

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3637-0
00:17:35.079 --> 00:17:35.799
Yeah, yeah. Great.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3645-1
00:17:38.114 --> 00:17:38.569
regime.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3649-0
00:17:38.579 --> 00:17:39.029
Buckets.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3651-0
00:17:39.039 --> 00:17:39.549
Right.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3734-0
00:17:39.999 --> 00:17:44.416
So keeping that in mind, if you
have a certain salary round of

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3734-1
00:17:44.416 --> 00:17:48.833
range 0 to 50,000 so they are
lying under some certain tax lab

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3734-2
00:17:48.833 --> 00:17:53.040
so that can be that these are
amount of people who has been

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3734-3
00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:57.317
applicable from that range and
then from 50 to 1,00,000 they

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3712-0
00:17:57.249 --> 00:17:57.639
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3734-4
00:17:57.317 --> 00:17:58.789
are lying up in some.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3715-0
00:17:57.649 --> 00:17:58.139
OK, Mr.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3717-0
00:17:58.149 --> 00:17:58.379
David.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3724-0
00:17:58.389 --> 00:17:59.189
Yeah, that is fine.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3750-0
00:17:59.199 --> 00:18:01.971
I I think it is coming to
virtually the same as what one

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3750-1
00:18:01.971 --> 00:18:04.499
of your colleague has said about
the income, right?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3767-0
00:18:05.009 --> 00:18:07.039
So it is virtually the income
distribution.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3761-0
00:18:05.599 --> 00:18:05.879
Right.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3769-0
00:18:07.049 --> 00:18:08.349
You're OK?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3791-0
00:18:07.739 --> 00:18:10.855
Even the age of retirement of a
person will be as in

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3778-0
00:18:08.359 --> 00:18:08.729
OK, fine.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3791-1
00:18:10.855 --> 00:18:11.619
distribution.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3792-0
00:18:11.949 --> 00:18:13.359
Ease of retirement person.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3803-0
00:18:13.369 --> 00:18:15.499
There is nothing to do a
distribution there, do you?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3806-0
00:18:15.549 --> 00:18:15.819
Are you?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3816-0
00:18:15.829 --> 00:18:17.269
Can you create a distribution
there?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3860-0
00:18:18.289 --> 00:18:21.536
Like uh, age of retirement, we
can take it as an X axis and age

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3860-1
00:18:21.536 --> 00:18:24.732
of the people we can take around
Y axis and most of the people

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3860-2
00:18:24.732 --> 00:18:27.877
will be majority of the people
will be dying in the middle of

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3860-3
00:18:27.877 --> 00:18:28.739
the 60s or older.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3878-0
00:18:28.749 --> 00:18:30.049
So, so there we can say.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3870-0
00:18:28.949 --> 00:18:30.039
Oh, OK, OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3886-0
00:18:30.049 --> 00:18:33.039
So you are saying that people
will retire many times?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3922-0
00:18:33.199 --> 00:18:36.765
India Government is a retirement
age of 60, but there may be some

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3912-0
00:18:35.219 --> 00:18:37.509
Yes, C-16.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3922-1
00:18:36.765 --> 00:18:39.899
people who retired early and
some people will continue to

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3933-0
00:18:39.879 --> 00:18:41.669
It's worked there too.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3922-2
00:18:39.899 --> 00:18:40.709
work till late.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3947-0
00:18:40.749 --> 00:18:42.849
Is that what you're OK. OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3970-0
00:18:42.179 --> 00:18:45.397
Uh majority will be dying on 16
meter of the 60, so there we can

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3970-1
00:18:45.397 --> 00:18:48.119
say hi negatively skewed
distribution over there even.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4015-0
00:18:48.459 --> 00:18:52.697
Alright, maybe that he getting
sales as well can be the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/3982-0
00:18:48.739 --> 00:18:51.129
Uh, OK, OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4015-1
00:18:52.697 --> 00:18:57.388
example, like on a certain date
range, the ticket sales got a

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4015-2
00:18:57.388 --> 00:19:00.869
very high amount of frequency of
the booking.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4006-0
00:18:59.859 --> 00:19:00.229
Yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4011-0
00:19:00.239 --> 00:19:00.439
Yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4023-0
00:19:00.449 --> 00:19:00.639
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4029-0
00:19:01.299 --> 00:19:02.839
So that can also be the example.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4025-0
00:19:01.519 --> 00:19:01.939
Hmm.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4031-0
00:19:02.989 --> 00:19:03.939
Yes, yes, yes.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4034-0
00:19:03.949 --> 00:19:05.319
Right, right, right.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4037-0
00:19:05.329 --> 00:19:07.159
So I yes.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4052-0
00:19:09.209 --> 00:19:10.589
Passcode and examination.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4049-0
00:19:11.139 --> 00:19:12.019
Marks coordinates.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4054-0
00:19:12.029 --> 00:19:12.719
Yeah, yeah, fine.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4056-0
00:19:12.729 --> 00:19:12.959
Fine.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4061-0
00:19:12.969 --> 00:19:13.809
Yeah, yeah, alright.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4063-0
00:19:13.879 --> 00:19:14.209
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4066-0
00:19:14.219 --> 00:19:14.639
Thank you.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4145-0
00:19:14.699 --> 00:19:18.241
I think we by now I think
everybody has understood what is

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4145-1
00:19:18.241 --> 00:19:22.082
the, what is the the long tail
we are talking about what is the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4145-2
00:19:22.082 --> 00:19:25.324
mean around which the
distribution we are considering

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4145-3
00:19:25.324 --> 00:19:28.865
and then when do we say it is
symmetric and when do we say

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4145-4
00:19:28.865 --> 00:19:32.227
symmetric and So what is
symmetric and then and then we

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4145-5
00:19:32.227 --> 00:19:35.288
have also seen that many
examples where we have an

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4145-6
00:19:35.288 --> 00:19:37.509
asymmetric or a skewed
distribution.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4149-0
00:19:37.699 --> 00:19:38.709
So, so far so good.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4163-0
00:19:38.719 --> 00:19:43.159
So I think I think I think it
is, but well spent.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4189-0
00:19:43.219 --> 00:19:47.465
So now what we are saying is
that in such cases we have a far

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4189-1
00:19:47.465 --> 00:19:49.999
more complex, but things to
explain.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4221-0
00:19:50.309 --> 00:19:54.177
So in case of when we assume it
is a normal distribution, so we

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4221-1
00:19:54.177 --> 00:19:57.623
are trying to compute the
probability of how many people

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4221-2
00:19:57.623 --> 00:19:59.859
will be willing to pay more than
30.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4281-0
00:19:59.929 --> 00:20:02.797
So we got some answer, but when
it is gamma distribution, you

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4281-1
00:20:02.797 --> 00:20:05.712
can keep tuning alpha and beta
and then you are going to get a

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4281-2
00:20:05.712 --> 00:20:08.626
different types of values with
respect to how many more people

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4281-3
00:20:08.626 --> 00:20:11.679
will be, how many people will be
willing to pay more than $30.00.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4326-0
00:20:12.249 --> 00:20:16.529
So so I think I hope that gives
you a fair understanding of how

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4326-1
00:20:16.529 --> 00:20:20.475
to look at the data when you get
some numbers and how much

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4326-2
00:20:20.475 --> 00:20:24.622
conclusion you can draw and how
much confidence you will have

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4326-3
00:20:24.622 --> 00:20:24.889
you.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4354-0
00:20:24.899 --> 00:20:27.503
It's possible that we are not
trying to measure the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4354-1
00:20:27.503 --> 00:20:30.657
confidence, but you can see that
when the population is small,

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4354-2
00:20:30.657 --> 00:20:32.209
then you start suspecting that.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4359-0
00:20:32.259 --> 00:20:33.969
Have you got the distribution
right?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4415-0
00:20:34.359 --> 00:20:38.037
It is always a questionable that
with small population when

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4415-1
00:20:38.037 --> 00:20:41.531
you're trying to formulate a
distribution, it may not be

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4415-2
00:20:41.531 --> 00:20:45.209
good, but then there are many
methods which assume that you

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4415-3
00:20:45.209 --> 00:20:49.193
can compute a probability that X
will be greater than something,

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4415-4
00:20:49.193 --> 00:20:50.909
or X will be less than this.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4432-0
00:20:51.469 --> 00:20:57.029
So in order for you to give a
give a output pattern.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4435-0
00:20:57.779 --> 00:20:58.349
So.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4449-0
00:20:58.399 --> 00:21:01.159
So in such cases you just have
to take it with the.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4468-0
00:21:01.199 --> 00:21:03.466
If you think your data is
insufficient, then you have to

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4468-1
00:21:03.466 --> 00:21:04.619
take it with a pinch of salt.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4499-0
00:21:04.959 --> 00:21:08.175
So you just have to keep trying
and then finally, finally, you

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4499-1
00:21:08.175 --> 00:21:11.339
need to make an assumption and
you need to accept the result.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4502-0
00:21:12.149 --> 00:21:13.619
But can you talk once more?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4515-0
00:21:13.629 --> 00:21:16.509
How did you move from that
skewed data to gamma

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4515-1
00:21:16.509 --> 00:21:17.289
distribution?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4549-0
00:21:17.299 --> 00:21:21.179
What all did you do to and what
floating was done?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4529-0
00:21:19.179 --> 00:21:19.989
No, nothing.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4538-0
00:21:20.059 --> 00:21:20.789
We did nothing.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4555-0
00:21:20.799 --> 00:21:24.158
All we said is that all we said
is that now the data doesn't

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4555-1
00:21:24.158 --> 00:21:24.929
look balanced.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4566-0
00:21:24.939 --> 00:21:26.229
Why not try a gamma
distribution?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4574-0
00:21:27.379 --> 00:21:29.689
So how do we get to
commoditization though?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4576-0
00:21:29.729 --> 00:21:29.929
What?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4581-0
00:21:29.939 --> 00:21:30.409
What do we do?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4620-0
00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:36.389
So let's say we do with that of
1000, you know employees, which

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4597-0
00:21:32.219 --> 00:21:32.569
Uh.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4616-0
00:21:36.239 --> 00:21:38.119
You know there is, there is no
there.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4620-1
00:21:36.389 --> 00:21:37.089
is skewed.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4636-0
00:21:38.129 --> 00:21:39.829
There is no formula, so since.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4638-0
00:21:40.379 --> 00:21:42.549
So how did you get the Gaussian
distribution within an

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4638-1
00:21:42.549 --> 00:21:43.219
assumption right?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4653-0
00:21:43.639 --> 00:21:47.039
Similarly, gamma distribution is
an assumption which is based on

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4653-1
00:21:47.039 --> 00:21:48.399
alpha and beta parameters.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4668-0
00:21:50.409 --> 00:21:52.769
And what are alpha and beta
parameters?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4706-0
00:21:53.499 --> 00:21:57.617
Also beta parameters is you can
see in the I have given the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4706-1
00:21:57.617 --> 00:22:01.735
formula and this is the formula
and gamma alpha function is

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4706-2
00:22:01.735 --> 00:22:05.785
actually it is a factorial
function on alpha so so this is

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4706-3
00:22:05.785 --> 00:22:06.059
the.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4718-0
00:22:06.119 --> 00:22:09.569
This is the what is the function
and for normal distribution?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4742-0
00:22:09.579 --> 00:22:12.995
I think I may have given in
another slide deck, so normal

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4742-1
00:22:12.995 --> 00:22:15.409
distribution this is this is the
format.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4747-0
00:22:15.799 --> 00:22:17.879
So we around X.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4758-0
00:22:18.199 --> 00:22:21.289
This is the MU, MU is the mean
around mean.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4777-0
00:22:21.299 --> 00:22:24.924
You are assuming that it is
distributed on both sides, with

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4777-1
00:22:24.924 --> 00:22:27.039
the A spread controlled by
signal.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4789-0
00:22:29.259 --> 00:22:29.869
I mean it would.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4799-0
00:22:29.499 --> 00:22:30.489
Are who who?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4826-0
00:22:29.879 --> 00:22:32.844
Would there be any tool or
something that we would be able

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4808-0
00:22:29.929 --> 00:22:30.239
Can you?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4817-0
00:22:30.499 --> 00:22:32.139
Who is talking OK, Mr SUMIT?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4826-1
00:22:32.844 --> 00:22:35.709
to use whether you know it is
normal distributed or not?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4843-0
00:22:35.719 --> 00:22:37.489
How do we practically use it
for?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4848-0
00:22:37.659 --> 00:22:38.989
No, no, that is what I'm telling
now.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4855-0
00:22:38.119 --> 00:22:38.939
I'm trying to understand.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4857-0
00:22:38.999 --> 00:22:40.349
You need to know about your
data.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4871-0
00:22:40.539 --> 00:22:42.929
That is what now you want to
discover patterns in your data.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4884-0
00:22:42.939 --> 00:22:45.000
If you don't know your data,
then you need to be

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4884-1
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:45.589
uncomfortable.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4889-0
00:22:45.599 --> 00:22:45.939
Is it not?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4911-0
00:22:47.539 --> 00:22:51.751
Nobody is saying that you do one
pattern because The thing is

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4911-1
00:22:51.751 --> 00:22:53.789
that the data exists as it is.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4916-0
00:22:53.839 --> 00:22:54.329
It is not.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4919-0
00:22:54.339 --> 00:22:55.409
It mean see.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4921-0
00:22:55.419 --> 00:22:55.809
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4923-0
00:22:55.819 --> 00:22:56.299
Maybe.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4951-0
00:22:56.349 --> 00:23:00.604
Maybe, Mr SUMIT, I think you are
really looking for an answer

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4951-1
00:23:00.604 --> 00:23:04.309
which is but which is I think a
philosophical answer.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4970-0
00:23:04.319 --> 00:23:05.579
I think that is what you're
looking for.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4978-0
00:23:06.529 --> 00:23:08.279
You know, I'm looking for
practical answer.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4997-0
00:23:07.159 --> 00:23:09.359
So can we say this the this?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5010-0
00:23:08.159 --> 00:23:10.637
Because because because The
thing is that what you are

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/4996-0
00:23:08.289 --> 00:23:09.239
Maybe it would come later.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5010-1
00:23:10.637 --> 00:23:13.069
saying is I think this is what
you are saying, right?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5009-0
00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:10.999
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5035-0
00:23:13.299 --> 00:23:17.242
All models are wrong, but some
are useful and now that is it is

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5035-1
00:23:17.242 --> 00:23:20.569
your responsibility to find out
which is more useful.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5044-0
00:23:20.639 --> 00:23:22.229
There is no no simple formula.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5053-0
00:23:23.039 --> 00:23:25.289
There is no simple formula
saying that population.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5057-0
00:23:25.299 --> 00:23:26.489
I will take Gaussian
distribution.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5063-0
00:23:26.499 --> 00:23:27.129
What will happen?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5076-0
00:23:27.269 --> 00:23:30.501
So you can imagine you are also
a experience with professional

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5076-1
00:23:30.501 --> 00:23:30.809
right?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5081-0
00:23:30.959 --> 00:23:32.189
You can imagine what will
happen.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5100-0
00:23:32.199 --> 00:23:35.432
Suppose you take the salaries as
simple Gaussian distribution

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5100-1
00:23:35.432 --> 00:23:37.049
balanced Gaussian distribution.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5120-0
00:23:37.499 --> 00:23:40.789
So now the question is that yes,
the model will be wrong.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5115-0
00:23:38.269 --> 00:23:38.689
So can we?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5142-0
00:23:40.859 --> 00:23:43.583
But even if you take gamma
distribution, there will be

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5142-1
00:23:43.583 --> 00:23:46.703
there will be an approximation,
but it may be more useful than

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5142-2
00:23:46.703 --> 00:23:47.149
Gaussian.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5148-0
00:23:47.159 --> 00:23:47.519
Is it not?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5164-0
00:23:48.939 --> 00:23:51.422
Is that are you In Sync or
you're really trying to say

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5163-0
00:23:50.279 --> 00:23:50.439
So.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5164-1
00:23:51.422 --> 00:23:52.099
something else?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5189-0
00:23:55.219 --> 00:23:56.849
I think somewhat, but not fully.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5174-0
00:23:55.669 --> 00:23:55.959
Mr.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5196-0
00:23:55.969 --> 00:23:59.159
Smith, are you trying to say
something else or or you are

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5196-1
00:23:59.159 --> 00:24:00.259
saying that you are?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5205-0
00:24:00.269 --> 00:24:03.009
You are seeing that yes, data
requires a diligence.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5246-0
00:24:05.039 --> 00:24:08.912
I was just trying to make
practical sense of how do we get

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5231-0
00:24:08.859 --> 00:24:09.769
No, no there is not.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5246-1
00:24:08.912 --> 00:24:10.619
to something else if yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5248-0
00:24:09.779 --> 00:24:12.319
See the practical sense is that
everything we talked about is

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5248-1
00:24:12.319 --> 00:24:12.729
practical.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5254-0
00:24:12.739 --> 00:24:13.249
Is it not?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5258-0
00:24:13.579 --> 00:24:14.709
The income is practical.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5285-0
00:24:14.719 --> 00:24:18.000
Is is practical and all
distributions are, because if

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5285-1
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.402
the Government of India is
trying to make a plot, it is

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5285-2
00:24:21.402 --> 00:24:22.009
practical.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5293-0
00:24:22.019 --> 00:24:23.349
Is it not so?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5317-0
00:24:23.359 --> 00:24:26.753
It has got a billion people and
it is plotting the age, but then

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5317-1
00:24:26.753 --> 00:24:28.789
what you get is that there you
cannot.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5325-0
00:24:28.879 --> 00:24:30.319
But there in this case it is.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5332-0
00:24:30.329 --> 00:24:31.869
You can say that it is very
simple.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5379-0
00:24:32.059 --> 00:24:35.255
It is not a a symmetric
distribution, but then what do

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5379-1
00:24:35.255 --> 00:24:38.857
what I'm saying is that in your
own company, if you have data

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5379-2
00:24:38.857 --> 00:24:42.518
now, you would responsibility to
see that you want to minimize

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5379-3
00:24:42.518 --> 00:24:43.099
the error.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5392-0
00:24:43.109 --> 00:24:46.460
So you have to try all all
possible things available to

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5392-1
00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:46.699
you.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5396-0
00:24:46.709 --> 00:24:47.109
Is it not?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5409-0
00:24:48.189 --> 00:24:49.069
OK, OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5428-0
00:24:49.169 --> 00:24:52.349
But if I make if I make a, if I
make an, you put it.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5425-0
00:24:49.859 --> 00:24:52.049
Clean, but I've been sick.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5434-0
00:24:53.189 --> 00:24:54.449
Mr Rajesh, yes, go ahead.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5443-0
00:24:55.819 --> 00:24:57.549
If I make can we put it this
way, Sir?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5466-0
00:24:57.559 --> 00:25:02.949
How do we go from gas to
Gaussian to beta distribution?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5476-0
00:25:03.279 --> 00:25:04.419
Educated guesses what?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5463-0
00:25:03.379 --> 00:25:04.169
No, no, no, no.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5484-0
00:25:04.279 --> 00:25:06.965
This is just listen, listen, we
are not going from anywhere to

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5484-1
00:25:06.965 --> 00:25:07.349
anywhere.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5494-0
00:25:07.799 --> 00:25:10.859
We have looked at Gaussian
distribution and Gaussian

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5494-1
00:25:10.859 --> 00:25:11.609
distribution.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5516-0
00:25:11.859 --> 00:25:15.193
We we can see that when we plot
the Gaussian distribution, when

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5516-1
00:25:15.193 --> 00:25:17.589
we look at the histogram, it
seems to be odd.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5524-0
00:25:17.979 --> 00:25:18.609
So.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5549-0
00:25:18.619 --> 00:25:21.332
So we thought that, OK, why not
we try another distribution,

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5549-1
00:25:21.332 --> 00:25:24.133
that doesn't mean that this this
data is exactly following the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5549-2
00:25:24.133 --> 00:25:24.889
new distribution.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5558-0
00:25:25.639 --> 00:25:26.129
Is that clear?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5569-0
00:25:25.649 --> 00:25:28.713
They so basically like to answer
the question, can we say it's an

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5569-1
00:25:28.713 --> 00:25:29.409
educated guess?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5636-0
00:25:29.419 --> 00:25:33.089
We have to continually make
until we reach, yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5585-0
00:25:30.699 --> 00:25:31.519
Yes, that is right.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5597-0
00:25:32.269 --> 00:25:35.459
Yes, actually you need to have a
that affinity for the data.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5602-0
00:25:35.499 --> 00:25:36.319
That is what not you.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5640-0
00:25:36.329 --> 00:25:39.534
So you are going to be a data
scientist with so many numbers,

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5640-1
00:25:39.534 --> 00:25:42.945
so you just need to keep looking
at the data and seeing that what

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5640-2
00:25:42.945 --> 00:25:44.599
is the best way I understand it.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5671-0
00:25:45.089 --> 00:25:48.641
I agree because if there was a
formula, there wouldn't be need

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5671-1
00:25:48.641 --> 00:25:50.839
for data science or practical
formula.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5668-0
00:25:50.019 --> 00:25:51.449
That is right, absolutely right.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5672-0
00:25:51.519 --> 00:25:52.269
Absolutely right.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5705-0
00:25:52.279 --> 00:25:55.689
Because it's it's in fact, I
think that whatever that

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5705-1
00:25:55.689 --> 00:25:59.289
philosopher said about the
models is, I think I I'm sure

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5705-2
00:25:59.289 --> 00:26:00.489
you people know it.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5730-0
00:26:00.679 --> 00:26:04.888
So the model you know model can
be perfect so so but then you

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5730-1
00:26:04.888 --> 00:26:08.621
need to see, you need to still
depend on some model to

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5730-2
00:26:08.621 --> 00:26:09.639
represent some.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5744-0
00:26:14.379 --> 00:26:18.169
Alright, so we will, we will
proceed with another one.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5754-0
00:26:18.239 --> 00:26:19.949
This is more to do with the.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5757-0
00:26:20.079 --> 00:26:20.929
This is a.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5769-0
00:26:20.979 --> 00:26:24.549
This is so we talked about data
and trying to model.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5794-0
00:26:24.619 --> 00:26:29.459
So now we are trying to look at
how do we get a hypothesis and

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5794-1
00:26:29.459 --> 00:26:32.609
how can we be sure about the
hypothesis.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5805-0
00:26:32.839 --> 00:26:37.169
So now let us look at a some
information.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5817-0
00:26:37.379 --> 00:26:39.229
So I think all of us know about
this.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5822-0
00:26:39.279 --> 00:26:41.349
This slide I don't need to
explain.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5844-0
00:26:44.009 --> 00:26:46.394
If somebody is having doubt, you
can ask, but I don't think I

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5844-1
00:26:46.394 --> 00:26:47.009
need to explain.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5855-0
00:26:51.179 --> 00:26:52.679
So can I ask a quick question?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5856-0
00:26:53.359 --> 00:26:54.169
Yes, sure.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5867-0
00:26:54.239 --> 00:26:54.749
Sure, why not?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5879-0
00:26:54.599 --> 00:26:58.760
Uh, so you weren't using two
slides to when you were doing

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5879-1
00:26:58.760 --> 00:26:59.959
for the formulas?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5891-0
00:27:02.019 --> 00:27:04.269
Is is it there in the module
section?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5908-0
00:27:06.319 --> 00:27:09.659
Ohh I don't know, I don't know
what is the question.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5919-0
00:27:09.669 --> 00:27:10.839
I have not understood the
question.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5936-0
00:27:11.119 --> 00:27:15.708
To you, you are using two slaves
right to show the one you used

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5936-1
00:27:15.708 --> 00:27:17.859
for representing the formulas.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5937-0
00:27:18.889 --> 00:27:19.299
Ohh.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5939-0
00:27:19.309 --> 00:27:19.759
OK, OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5945-0
00:27:19.769 --> 00:27:20.939
Just one minute I think.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5949-0
00:27:20.949 --> 00:27:21.139
Uh.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5977-0
00:27:21.149 --> 00:27:24.568
The gamma distribution formula
is in a slide deck two and then

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5977-1
00:27:24.568 --> 00:27:27.499
the Gaussian distribution
formalized in slide deck 3.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5981-0
00:27:27.509 --> 00:27:28.119
Is that correct?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5991-0
00:27:28.189 --> 00:27:29.379
That is what you're saying,
right?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6011-0
00:27:28.339 --> 00:27:30.479
33 yeah, yeah. So.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5994-0
00:27:29.609 --> 00:27:29.879
Yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/5996-0
00:27:29.889 --> 00:27:30.059
Yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6006-0
00:27:30.069 --> 00:27:31.419
No, no, you will have both of
them.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6028-0
00:27:31.429 --> 00:27:34.459
Yeah, you will have because that
was the coming from the last

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6027-0
00:27:33.069 --> 00:27:33.599
After this.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6028-1
00:27:34.459 --> 00:27:35.339
class, last class.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6045-0
00:27:35.349 --> 00:27:37.460
We could not complete the
slides, so that is why there are

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6045-1
00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:37.889
some slides.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6046-0
00:27:38.979 --> 00:27:39.239
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6054-0
00:27:42.349 --> 00:27:44.169
Somebody else has having some
question.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6068-0
00:27:44.599 --> 00:27:45.799
OK, so let's proceed.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6084-0
00:27:45.659 --> 00:27:49.339
So, Sir, can we use those
formulas to calculate, uh,

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6084-1
00:27:49.339 --> 00:27:53.089
something like a Live like how
to use those formulas?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6101-0
00:27:54.899 --> 00:27:58.529
No, they there is nothing to
know about using the formula.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6122-0
00:27:59.219 --> 00:28:03.025
The point is that these formula
is, so these are the very

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6122-1
00:28:03.025 --> 00:28:06.109
popular formulas in statistical
distributions.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6131-0
00:28:06.539 --> 00:28:09.589
So very, very popular
mathematical formulas.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6174-0
00:28:09.679 --> 00:28:13.072
So when you take this formula
and try to plot the density

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6145-0
00:28:10.399 --> 00:28:10.569
Again.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6174-1
00:28:13.072 --> 00:28:16.757
function X along the X axis and
density function along Y axis,

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6174-2
00:28:16.757 --> 00:28:20.149
FX along the Y axis, this is the
shape that you will get.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6178-0
00:28:20.479 --> 00:28:21.469
So nothing else.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6191-0
00:28:21.479 --> 00:28:23.459
So I do not know what is the
question you are asking.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6248-0
00:28:25.219 --> 00:28:29.545
But I I you know when when we do
have a huge set of data would

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6205-0
00:28:25.809 --> 00:28:26.019
Like.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6248-1
00:28:29.545 --> 00:28:33.803
put there be some functions so
tools available to technically

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6223-0
00:28:29.909 --> 00:28:30.129
Hmm.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6248-2
00:28:33.803 --> 00:28:37.099
apply this formula to get to
that distribution.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6237-0
00:28:36.439 --> 00:28:36.759
Yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6243-0
00:28:36.769 --> 00:28:36.989
Yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6293-0
00:28:36.999 --> 00:28:41.223
Maybe we will talk about how to
how to look at the data and then

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6293-1
00:28:41.223 --> 00:28:45.316
that give me we may come back
because in the slide deck three,

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6293-2
00:28:45.316 --> 00:28:49.280
I looked at a little bit about
the distribution and then the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6293-3
00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:51.879
shape of the distribution a
little bit.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6304-0
00:28:51.999 --> 00:28:54.609
But then there is no formula
anywhere, no formula.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6339-0
00:28:54.619 --> 00:28:59.273
Actually, I will also look at
maybe maybe I will bring in two

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6339-1
00:28:59.273 --> 00:29:04.076
elements, maybe that helps you
suppose that I have a I have the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6339-2
00:29:04.076 --> 00:29:07.979
distribution of data and state
normal distribution.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6344-0
00:29:07.989 --> 00:29:08.999
Suppose I take.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6361-0
00:29:09.769 --> 00:29:14.779
Then I should get a skew OF0 and
kurtosis of zero.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6376-0
00:29:15.189 --> 00:29:19.019
When I use the Excel functions
on that data so.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6397-0
00:29:19.069 --> 00:29:22.587
So if you have a data that is
not coming, so it tells that it

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6397-1
00:29:22.587 --> 00:29:24.119
is not normal distribution.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6418-0
00:29:24.129 --> 00:29:26.939
It is not very close to normal
distribution, but then it

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6418-1
00:29:26.939 --> 00:29:29.009
because we do not have too many
formulas.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6429-0
00:29:29.019 --> 00:29:31.411
So we have got either one
distribution or other

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6429-1
00:29:31.411 --> 00:29:32.059
distribution.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6437-0
00:29:32.069 --> 00:29:33.559
So we have to go with one of
them.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6448-0
00:29:33.569 --> 00:29:35.299
So you don't have a many
choices.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6468-0
00:29:35.729 --> 00:29:37.980
There are only three or four
popular distributions that

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6468-1
00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:39.989
people use, so you have to live
with one of them.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6473-0
00:29:40.459 --> 00:29:41.709
A.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6492-0
00:29:42.149 --> 00:29:44.519
What do you mean by Q? Tosis,
Sir?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6484-0
00:29:44.939 --> 00:29:45.529
Yeah, I'll.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6528-0
00:29:45.539 --> 00:29:48.958
I'll come to that in a short
I'll come to that in a it is

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6500-0
00:29:46.359 --> 00:29:46.979
Yeah, OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6528-1
00:29:48.958 --> 00:29:52.436
just indicating I I think I have
another slide to show the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6528-2
00:29:52.436 --> 00:29:54.499
quotes, but don't expect too
much.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6548-0
00:29:54.509 --> 00:29:58.087
It is just saying that instead
of normal distribution, it is

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6548-1
00:29:58.087 --> 00:30:00.609
simply a variant of a normal
distribution.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6567-0
00:30:02.809 --> 00:30:04.479
And said that the particulars in
the.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6562-0
00:30:03.849 --> 00:30:04.179
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6571-0
00:30:04.189 --> 00:30:06.779
Mr Rajesh, is this an answer or
a question?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6582-0
00:30:06.789 --> 00:30:09.989
I'm because it's a long thing,
Mr Rajesh.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6598-0
00:30:09.989 --> 00:30:13.539
And that was that was an answer
to someone.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6591-0
00:30:09.999 --> 00:30:10.689
Why you have to speak up?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6607-0
00:30:15.389 --> 00:30:15.969
Somebody asked.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6612-0
00:30:16.039 --> 00:30:16.639
OK. OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6617-0
00:30:16.649 --> 00:30:17.299
Thank you so much.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6621-0
00:30:17.309 --> 00:30:18.229
Thank you so much. Alright.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6636-0
00:30:20.009 --> 00:30:24.049
Uh, so just I want to know the
formula.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6662-0
00:30:24.059 --> 00:30:27.490
The simple formulas in the Excel
that is mean and given the range

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6662-1
00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:30.349
of the data and that is the
formula or something else.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6674-0
00:30:31.419 --> 00:30:34.229
Yet the mean is equal to C you
can always compute.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6694-0
00:30:34.239 --> 00:30:37.385
For example, I have a
spreadsheet, so all I do is that

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6694-1
00:30:37.385 --> 00:30:38.929
I want to compute the mean.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6704-0
00:30:38.939 --> 00:30:40.769
I don't even go to the formula
for the mean.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6733-0
00:30:40.779 --> 00:30:43.975
So you can see at the bottom
there is an average that is that

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6733-1
00:30:43.975 --> 00:30:47.119
you can straight to put it as a
mean but standard deviation.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6742-0
00:30:47.129 --> 00:30:48.769
You need to take the formula
which is.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6764-0
00:30:48.829 --> 00:30:52.520
It has available in standard
deviation and standard deviation

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6764-1
00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:55.139
with PS as a population standard
deviation.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6767-0
00:30:55.149 --> 00:30:56.069
Yes, as a sample.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6796-0
00:30:56.079 --> 00:31:01.923
So it tells you the formula, so
that is not a big deal, so I can

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6796-1
00:31:01.923 --> 00:31:05.069
safely give it a pass saying
that.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6825-0
00:31:05.079 --> 00:31:09.170
OK, so when you have a data,
yeah, you need the you need to

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6825-1
00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:11.829
be able to compute these these
things.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6857-0
00:31:12.299 --> 00:31:15.907
But then and you better it is a
normal distribution or not is

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6857-1
00:31:15.907 --> 00:31:19.573
better understood by looking at
things like skew and kurtosis,

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6857-2
00:31:19.573 --> 00:31:21.959
but they are not going to tell
you that.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6866-0
00:31:21.969 --> 00:31:23.209
What is the what you should do?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6873-0
00:31:23.329 --> 00:31:24.479
It is only telling you that.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6906-0
00:31:24.489 --> 00:31:28.871
OK, it maybe normal distribution
is not safe, but but there is no

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6906-1
00:31:28.871 --> 00:31:32.655
formula because so many times
this is you think that the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6906-2
00:31:32.655 --> 00:31:34.779
sample itself is not big enough.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6913-0
00:31:34.789 --> 00:31:37.079
So you may simply make some
assumptions.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6923-0
00:31:41.339 --> 00:31:43.169
OK, this slide is it clear.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6929-0
00:31:43.179 --> 00:31:44.129
I hope it is clear.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6941-0
00:31:44.139 --> 00:31:47.089
I anyway, you, all of us are at
the same page.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6956-0
00:31:47.099 --> 00:31:50.798
The total awareness program is
something which the government

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6956-1
00:31:50.798 --> 00:31:52.409
initially thought, why not?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6966-0
00:31:52.899 --> 00:31:57.109
We use the data and data science
to catch terrorists.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6980-0
00:31:59.119 --> 00:32:02.089
So that is the that is the
purpose of total awareness

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6980-1
00:32:02.089 --> 00:32:02.529
program.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6997-0
00:32:03.859 --> 00:32:06.924
So now what is the problem that
do you see when you have a

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/6997-1
00:32:06.924 --> 00:32:07.859
program like that?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7027-0
00:32:11.189 --> 00:32:14.591
Because they are seeing total
awareness program, they have

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7027-1
00:32:14.591 --> 00:32:18.166
every data related to terrorist
but then still they could not

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7027-2
00:32:18.166 --> 00:32:19.319
catch the terrorist.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7036-0
00:32:19.329 --> 00:32:20.499
Still, they did the job.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7040-0
00:32:20.549 --> 00:32:22.239
On September 1128.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7065-0
00:32:24.909 --> 00:32:27.998
Because they might be having
completely a discrete set of

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7065-1
00:32:27.998 --> 00:32:31.459
data that cannot be accompanied
with us some certain conclusion.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7079-0
00:32:34.249 --> 00:32:35.569
Didn't know what they're looking
for.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7076-0
00:32:34.269 --> 00:32:34.629
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7081-0
00:32:36.309 --> 00:32:37.179
Yeah, absolutely.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7085-0
00:32:37.189 --> 00:32:37.759
Absolutely.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7095-0
00:32:37.769 --> 00:32:40.199
That is, I think, yeah, I think
these are good answers.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7101-0
00:32:40.209 --> 00:32:41.639
Let us proceed little further.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7104-0
00:32:41.649 --> 00:32:42.179
Maybe.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7107-0
00:32:42.269 --> 00:32:43.319
Maybe we'll see.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7110-0
00:32:43.389 --> 00:32:43.879
We'll see.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7112-0
00:32:43.889 --> 00:32:44.279
What?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7117-0
00:32:44.769 --> 00:32:45.429
What is the?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7123-0
00:32:45.439 --> 00:32:46.039
What are the other?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7131-0
00:32:46.049 --> 00:32:47.819
I think these two are both are
good points.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7147-0
00:32:48.169 --> 00:32:51.914
So now let us look at a
principle that is called

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7147-1
00:32:51.914 --> 00:32:53.519
Bonferroni principle.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7180-0
00:32:53.989 --> 00:33:00.079
So what it says is that you have
a large volume of data and and

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7180-1
00:33:00.079 --> 00:33:05.503
then you are trying to find
discover a pattern from that

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7180-2
00:33:05.503 --> 00:33:05.979
data.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7198-0
00:33:07.049 --> 00:33:12.459
And even if the data is random,
even if the data is random, you

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7198-1
00:33:12.459 --> 00:33:15.079
may start seeing some patterns.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7218-0
00:33:18.199 --> 00:33:22.776
You may still start seeing that
setting events or second type

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7218-1
00:33:22.776 --> 00:33:23.809
are happening.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7226-0
00:33:24.579 --> 00:33:26.949
So now let us look at an
example.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7261-0
00:33:26.959 --> 00:33:31.275
Suppose that there is a country
with 1 billion people, OK, and

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7261-1
00:33:31.275 --> 00:33:35.453
and then the government has no
option and they want to catch

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7261-2
00:33:35.453 --> 00:33:39.289
any terrorist all over anyone,
anywhere in the country.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7275-0
00:33:39.459 --> 00:33:41.509
So everybody is a potential able
do it.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7309-0
00:33:41.569 --> 00:33:45.220
So everybody is a potential
terrorist and now they started

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7309-1
00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:48.995
using the logic that the total
awareness program with saying

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7309-2
00:33:48.995 --> 00:33:52.646
that, OK, we have the hotel
records, credit card receipts,

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7309-3
00:33:52.646 --> 00:33:53.389
travel data.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7315-0
00:33:53.659 --> 00:33:54.979
So OK, why not use it?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7345-0
00:33:55.559 --> 00:34:00.306
So let us say everybody goes to
a hotel on 1% of the days Monday

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7345-1
00:34:00.306 --> 00:34:03.739
in 100 days and then a hotel
holds 100 people.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7352-0
00:34:04.579 --> 00:34:06.589
So that means they can't.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7381-0
00:34:06.639 --> 00:34:10.137
The country has at least 100,000
hotels, so let us take for

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7381-1
00:34:10.137 --> 00:34:13.401
simplicity 100,000 hotels are
there and hotel holds 100

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7381-2
00:34:13.401 --> 00:34:13.809
people.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7399-0
00:34:13.819 --> 00:34:16.652
So they're 10 million people
that hotel can hold and

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7399-1
00:34:16.652 --> 00:34:18.629
everybody goes to hotel in 100
days.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7407-0
00:34:18.639 --> 00:34:19.829
So 1 billion population.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7415-0
00:34:19.839 --> 00:34:22.789
So it is well, it is perfect
situation.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7455-0
00:34:23.259 --> 00:34:28.188
So now, now we let us say we are
examining the hotel records for

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7455-1
00:34:28.188 --> 00:34:32.738
three years because the because
we know that the terrorists

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7455-2
00:34:32.738 --> 00:34:37.439
require a lead time before they
perform the dangerous things.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7467-0
00:34:37.869 --> 00:34:40.659
So we want to study the hotel
records for 1000 days.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7474-0
00:34:41.089 --> 00:34:42.969
So now we create a hypothesis.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7492-0
00:34:44.909 --> 00:34:50.291
We create a hypothesis 2 people
who on two different days stay

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7492-1
00:34:50.291 --> 00:34:51.829
at the same hotel.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7501-0
00:34:53.709 --> 00:34:55.389
Does it look like a failed
hypothesis?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7509-0
00:34:56.919 --> 00:34:57.179
No.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7512-0
00:34:58.939 --> 00:35:00.449
So we are suspecting.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7521-0
00:35:00.739 --> 00:35:02.729
We are suspecting the evil
doers.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7518-0
00:35:01.499 --> 00:35:01.839
It doesn't.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7533-0
00:35:03.079 --> 00:35:06.818
If we see that two people on two
different days stayed at the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7533-1
00:35:06.818 --> 00:35:07.119
same.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7536-0
00:35:09.949 --> 00:35:10.159
Uh.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7550-0
00:35:11.699 --> 00:35:11.929
I.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7568-0
00:35:12.259 --> 00:35:15.056
Someone might have referred the
other guy to use the hotel, so

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7568-1
00:35:15.056 --> 00:35:16.699
like they were visiting same
places.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7586-0
00:35:18.369 --> 00:35:19.669
No, there should be normal here.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7583-0
00:35:19.109 --> 00:35:21.099
No, but how will the government
find out?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7596-0
00:35:21.109 --> 00:35:23.059
So what is the hypothesis you
give it to them?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7611-0
00:35:23.569 --> 00:35:26.399
Because they have all credit
card data, they have hotel data.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7627-0
00:35:26.409 --> 00:35:29.541
They have every data, but what
hypothesis you will give them if

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7627-1
00:35:29.541 --> 00:35:31.009
they want to catch terrorists?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7639-0
00:35:35.489 --> 00:35:37.659
So now let us say they took the
hypothesis.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7641-0
00:35:37.669 --> 00:35:38.059
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7644-0
00:35:38.149 --> 00:35:38.719
Maybe.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7659-0
00:35:38.769 --> 00:35:41.330
Maybe there are problems, but
then let us say they took the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7659-1
00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:41.799
hypothesis.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7671-0
00:35:41.949 --> 00:35:44.209
So now let us compute what is
going to happen.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7680-0
00:35:42.039 --> 00:35:42.299
Hello.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7694-0
00:35:44.879 --> 00:35:49.714
So the probability of a person
visiting a hotel it is simple

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7694-1
00:35:49.714 --> 00:35:50.269
.01 OK?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7730-0
00:35:50.399 --> 00:35:54.587
And two people deciding to go to
the hotel on same day any same

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7730-1
00:35:54.587 --> 00:35:58.644
day is 10 to the power of minus
four because for every person

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7730-2
00:35:58.644 --> 00:36:00.149
the probability is .01.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7750-0
00:36:00.159 --> 00:36:03.190
So two arbitrary random people,
they're going to the hotel on

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7750-1
00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:05.389
the same day, 10 to the power of
minus four.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7758-0
00:36:05.789 --> 00:36:06.909
And now they don't.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7777-0
00:36:06.919 --> 00:36:09.918
100,000 hotels, so the
probability of going to the same

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7777-1
00:36:09.918 --> 00:36:11.899
hotel is 10 to the power minus
five.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7803-0
00:36:12.459 --> 00:36:16.546
So it is 10 to the power of
minus nine that two people are

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7803-1
00:36:16.546 --> 00:36:20.563
probability of two arbitrary
people are visiting the same

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7803-2
00:36:20.563 --> 00:36:20.979
hotel.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7842-0
00:36:21.969 --> 00:36:26.569
OK, so now these probability
that the same two people with

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7842-1
00:36:26.569 --> 00:36:31.480
visit the same hotel on and two
different days is tender for a

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7842-2
00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:34.209
-, 9 * 10 to the power minus
nine.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7855-0
00:36:34.219 --> 00:36:35.839
So we got 10 to the power of
minus 18.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7860-0
00:36:36.599 --> 00:36:37.529
So far so good.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7875-0
00:36:37.539 --> 00:36:41.529
It looks like a rare event, so
now let us look at relation.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7883-0
00:36:41.539 --> 00:36:43.279
The population is 10 to the 49.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7892-0
00:36:44.749 --> 00:36:47.649
OK, so I'm I'm hearing some
noise.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7908-0
00:36:47.659 --> 00:36:50.154
I'm going to mute you people for
five minutes and after that I

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7908-1
00:36:50.154 --> 00:36:50.629
will unmute.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7928-0
00:36:57.569 --> 00:37:00.041
So meanwhile you can keep
typing, not not a problem, and

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7928-1
00:37:00.041 --> 00:37:01.039
I'll catch up with you.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7935-0
00:37:04.609 --> 00:37:05.699
So it is fine.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7949-0
00:37:05.709 --> 00:37:07.899
So they'll population is 10 to
the power from 9.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7968-0
00:37:07.989 --> 00:37:12.125
So what is the the combination
page number of pages 10 to the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7968-1
00:37:12.125 --> 00:37:12.859
power of 9?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7976-0
00:37:13.349 --> 00:37:17.219
So and then and then what else?
C2, right?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7981-0
00:37:17.539 --> 00:37:18.639
Any two combinations.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/7991-0
00:37:18.879 --> 00:37:20.879
So what is the value of N C2?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8004-0
00:37:21.449 --> 00:37:24.859
This is equal to n -, 1 /, 2.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8042-0
00:37:25.009 --> 00:37:28.770
So this is approximately 5 into
10 to the power of 17 represents

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8042-1
00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:32.357
the number of pages of people
and the number of pairs of days

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8042-2
00:37:32.357 --> 00:37:35.019
that is there is 5 into 10 to
the power of 5.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8055-0
00:37:35.029 --> 00:37:37.219
So again, this is 10 to the
power of three days.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8081-0
00:37:37.549 --> 00:37:40.164
So you start picking up the
pages of the days 10 to the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8081-1
00:37:40.164 --> 00:37:41.939
power of 5 into 10 to the power
of 5.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8134-0
00:37:42.329 --> 00:37:46.553
So the expected number of events
that look like it will doing is

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8134-1
00:37:46.553 --> 00:37:50.517
product of the number of pairs
of people, number of pairs of

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8134-2
00:37:50.517 --> 00:37:54.545
days and the probability that
any pair of the people and pair

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8134-3
00:37:54.545 --> 00:37:58.639
of these is an instance of the
behavior as per our hypothesis.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8148-0
00:37:59.099 --> 00:38:03.289
So now we are saying this is the
possible number of pairs.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8203-0
00:38:03.479 --> 00:38:06.709
This is the possible page of
days and then this is the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8203-1
00:38:06.709 --> 00:38:10.232
probability that given a paid,
what is the probability that

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8203-2
00:38:10.232 --> 00:38:13.814
they will go to a hotel on the
same day within the 1000 days

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8203-3
00:38:13.814 --> 00:38:15.869
period, which is the day of
study.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8205-0
00:38:16.159 --> 00:38:18.309
So twice twice they go to the
same model.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8211-0
00:38:18.439 --> 00:38:20.049
The probability is 1/4 million.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8232-0
00:38:21.869 --> 00:38:27.040
So now, now the challenge is 1/4
million probabilities that they

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8232-1
00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:28.949
they are all suspicious.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8243-0
00:38:29.939 --> 00:38:34.019
So what is the cost of this
changing quarter million people?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8275-0
00:38:36.079 --> 00:38:39.189
It is enormous for any
government because they have to

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8275-1
00:38:39.189 --> 00:38:42.468
start looking for those all
those quarter million people,

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8275-2
00:38:42.468 --> 00:38:45.239
they have to start looking at
their antecedents.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8279-0
00:38:45.249 --> 00:38:45.569
What are?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8283-0
00:38:45.579 --> 00:38:46.569
What is their background?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8297-0
00:38:46.999 --> 00:38:50.589
What type of work they do and
what type of money they have?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8326-0
00:38:50.599 --> 00:38:53.747
What type of money that they
receive and then what type of

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8326-1
00:38:53.747 --> 00:38:57.269
communication that they're doing
and who are the people that they

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8326-2
00:38:57.269 --> 00:38:58.069
are talking to?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8338-0
00:38:58.139 --> 00:39:03.789
And so it is not easy if to a
police station.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8347-0
00:39:04.179 --> 00:39:05.909
Suppose that you are going to
report.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8388-0
00:39:06.269 --> 00:39:09.706
I saw in a city of 1,000,000
people if five people go and

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8388-1
00:39:09.706 --> 00:39:13.439
report every day saying that,
OK, there is a theft in our host

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8388-2
00:39:13.439 --> 00:39:15.039
and investigate it is fine.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8417-0
00:39:15.549 --> 00:39:19.528
But on one day, if 100,000
people go to the police station

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8417-1
00:39:19.528 --> 00:39:23.979
and complain that theft happened
in our house, catch the thieves.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8435-0
00:39:24.429 --> 00:39:27.629
The police station simply has to
raise their hands because it's

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8435-1
00:39:27.629 --> 00:39:29.929
impossible for them to handle
that case load.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8456-0
00:39:31.569 --> 00:39:34.578
So now we are saying that in the
country there are quarter

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8456-1
00:39:34.578 --> 00:39:37.179
million suspicious terrorist
suspected terrorists.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8479-0
00:39:37.729 --> 00:39:42.553
So you need to find everything
about them so that you can

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8479-1
00:39:42.553 --> 00:39:46.379
conclude that what is the the
plan of action.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8518-0
00:39:47.149 --> 00:39:52.839
So this is a virtually an
impossible task, even for a rich

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8518-1
00:39:52.839 --> 00:39:57.854
or the very resourceful
governments like US or some

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8518-2
00:39:57.854 --> 00:40:03.640
other advanced countries with
huge intelligence and and the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8518-3
00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:04.219
stuff.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8531-0
00:40:04.509 --> 00:40:09.319
So so now the question is that
what is the problem?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8541-0
00:40:09.329 --> 00:40:12.389
So now let us say, let us change
the hypothesis.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8549-0
00:40:13.919 --> 00:40:15.319
Let it change the hypothesis.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8567-0
00:40:20.459 --> 00:40:25.233
So we say that the two people on
three different days were at the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8567-1
00:40:25.233 --> 00:40:26.029
same hotel.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8625-0
00:40:26.299 --> 00:40:29.476
So now we had the same data, so
the probability of the same two

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8625-1
00:40:29.476 --> 00:40:32.753
people will be in the same hotel
on three different days is 10 to

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8625-2
00:40:32.753 --> 00:40:35.632
the power minus 27 and the
expected number of events that

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8625-3
00:40:35.632 --> 00:40:38.809
look like you were doing is 2.5
and 10 to the power minus four.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8648-0
00:40:38.879 --> 00:40:42.736
So here, here, any police
station will be able to handle

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8648-1
00:40:42.736 --> 00:40:45.239
if this is what you're going to
get.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8658-0
00:40:46.739 --> 00:40:48.909
Ohh no, no, no.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8671-0
00:40:48.919 --> 00:40:52.220
Let me unmute you people and see
what what is it that you are

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8671-1
00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:52.699
observed.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8685-0
00:41:00.819 --> 00:41:06.529
So nobody has typed anything, so
I'm just opening the discussion.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8690-0
00:41:06.539 --> 00:41:07.089
What do you think?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8698-0
00:41:07.099 --> 00:41:08.349
What do you what have you
observed?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8710-0
00:41:11.639 --> 00:41:12.609
No, the morgue.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8716-0
00:41:12.129 --> 00:41:13.319
So can we?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8745-0
00:41:14.229 --> 00:41:17.955
Can we assume this way that
motor listed the probability

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8724-0
00:41:14.709 --> 00:41:14.949
The.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8745-1
00:41:17.955 --> 00:41:21.745
mode will be the accuracy that
we are moving in the right

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8745-2
00:41:21.745 --> 00:41:22.399
direction?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8765-0
00:41:24.099 --> 00:41:27.585
Yeah, but how do you know that
lesser the the probability

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8765-1
00:41:27.585 --> 00:41:29.809
you're going in the right
direction?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8773-0
00:41:29.819 --> 00:41:30.369
How do you know that?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8797-0
00:41:31.399 --> 00:41:34.968
So so now the first thing is
that first thing is that OK, now

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8788-0
00:41:31.769 --> 00:41:33.459
But like like.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8785-0
00:41:31.999 --> 00:41:32.149
That.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8797-1
00:41:34.968 --> 00:41:35.889
let us be clear.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8809-0
00:41:36.419 --> 00:41:39.569
The American Government never
wanted the 9/11 to happen.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8869-0
00:41:39.619 --> 00:41:42.929
If they had resources, or if
they had slightest suspicion,

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8869-1
00:41:42.929 --> 00:41:46.014
they would have prevented,
because that is a once in a

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8869-2
00:41:46.014 --> 00:41:49.212
century event, it's not even
once in a decade event such

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8869-3
00:41:49.212 --> 00:41:52.634
events so rarely occur, so they
would have put in everything

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8869-4
00:41:52.634 --> 00:41:55.832
they would have spent billion
dollars or $100 billion to

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8869-5
00:41:55.832 --> 00:41:56.449
prevent it.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8889-0
00:41:57.109 --> 00:42:00.606
So now the question is that who
will give them a hypothesis that

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8889-1
00:42:00.606 --> 00:42:01.789
is going to help them?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8897-0
00:42:11.169 --> 00:42:13.469
Yes, Mr someone wants to say
something.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8921-0
00:42:16.619 --> 00:42:20.107
So whatever else less is our
data set, I mean whatever is

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8908-0
00:42:17.129 --> 00:42:17.489
Still.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8921-1
00:42:20.107 --> 00:42:20.829
that we get?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8936-0
00:42:20.839 --> 00:42:23.369
How much we can reduce the data
set would be helpful.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8957-0
00:42:23.379 --> 00:42:25.489
I mean, so if this is.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8959-0
00:42:24.169 --> 00:42:27.019
No, no, it is not a question of
if you reduce the data set.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9023-0
00:42:27.029 --> 00:42:30.884
Obviously you may be losing some
valuable data because here we

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/8974-0
00:42:28.029 --> 00:42:28.729
I mean if.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9023-1
00:42:30.884 --> 00:42:34.677
are saying that the the question
the problem that the book is

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9023-2
00:42:34.677 --> 00:42:38.532
talking about is that there was
all the data that is available

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9023-3
00:42:38.532 --> 00:42:41.897
to the government, but still
they could not prevent it

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9023-4
00:42:41.897 --> 00:42:45.507
because they they because some
of the data could have been

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9023-5
00:42:45.507 --> 00:42:46.119
suspected.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9031-0
00:42:46.999 --> 00:42:49.849
But but then what is really
missing?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9054-0
00:42:49.859 --> 00:42:52.803
Because we are looking at 2
possible hypothesis and the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9054-1
00:42:52.803 --> 00:42:55.169
results that come out of the two
hypothesis.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9082-0
00:42:57.479 --> 00:43:01.208
The better the have hypothesis,
more information we can extract

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9082-1
00:43:01.208 --> 00:43:03.539
from the data or easily we can
extract.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9083-0
00:43:04.019 --> 00:43:04.849
Absolutely.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9095-0
00:43:04.919 --> 00:43:08.449
Absolutely the if the hypothesis
is better, it is good.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9106-0
00:43:08.529 --> 00:43:11.209
But who is capable of giving a
right hypothesis?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9112-0
00:43:14.939 --> 00:43:15.059
Yes.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9116-0
00:43:15.459 --> 00:43:16.149
Same branch.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9127-0
00:43:15.849 --> 00:43:18.709
And yes, yes, yes, please.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9128-0
00:43:18.039 --> 00:43:19.609
It talking about owning data.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9141-0
00:43:21.609 --> 00:43:22.379
Let us antist.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9142-0
00:43:21.969 --> 00:43:24.029
Maybe someone who is analyzed
the data.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9148-0
00:43:25.959 --> 00:43:27.129
OK, OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9159-0
00:43:27.189 --> 00:43:32.309
So so now now my question to
Miss GURSIMRAN Kaur.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9175-0
00:43:32.319 --> 00:43:35.609
I think you are you are talking
about the so.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9174-0
00:43:34.419 --> 00:43:34.539
Yes.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9199-0
00:43:35.619 --> 00:43:39.332
So now what you are saying is
that it the US could have

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9199-1
00:43:39.332 --> 00:43:42.449
prevented the the event is that
is that right?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9218-0
00:43:43.769 --> 00:43:47.709
Is that what you are hypothesis
or is it your conclusion based

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9218-1
00:43:47.709 --> 00:43:48.459
on all this?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9221-0
00:43:49.589 --> 00:43:50.119
No, no, Sir.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9259-0
00:43:50.129 --> 00:43:54.306
Actually, based on the like
examples given, so as like the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9259-1
00:43:54.306 --> 00:43:58.837
better our hypothesis, the more
information we can extract from

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9259-2
00:43:58.837 --> 00:44:03.297
the data Friday seen the data or
analyzed it, maybe they could

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9259-3
00:44:03.297 --> 00:44:04.359
have prevented.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9272-0
00:44:06.279 --> 00:44:09.189
OK, OK, alright.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9288-0
00:44:08.899 --> 00:44:11.799
So Sir, the data set could not
be the conclusive enough that we

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9288-1
00:44:11.799 --> 00:44:13.929
can find out any solution, or at
least we can.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9295-0
00:44:13.939 --> 00:44:15.379
Uh, do some kind of a.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9312-0
00:44:17.149 --> 00:44:21.079
Yes, yes, the the situation is
not the giving.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9306-0
00:44:18.559 --> 00:44:18.939
So it's.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9319-0
00:44:21.089 --> 00:44:23.019
A hypothesis itself is not easy.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9343-0
00:44:23.029 --> 00:44:26.757
So many times, you may say that,
OK, the business analyst has to

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9343-1
00:44:26.757 --> 00:44:29.739
give me a hypothesis and I'm
going to work with it.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9374-0
00:44:29.749 --> 00:44:33.934
And then I'm going to to get
some patterns where our either

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9374-1
00:44:33.934 --> 00:44:38.119
prove or disprove the hypothesis
with the help of the data.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9403-0
00:44:38.429 --> 00:44:41.098
So that is what you are you like
to do with the data because

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9403-1
00:44:41.098 --> 00:44:43.635
somebody gives a hypothesis,
then you can either prove or

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9403-2
00:44:43.635 --> 00:44:44.029
disprove.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9434-0
00:44:44.329 --> 00:44:47.977
For example, some suppose that
you have to sell some products,

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9434-1
00:44:47.977 --> 00:44:51.277
so somebody gives you an
hypothesis that, OK, the people

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9434-2
00:44:51.277 --> 00:44:53.419
with higher income are going to
buy.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9493-0
00:44:53.469 --> 00:44:56.380
Maybe you want to prove or
disprove or similarly you may

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9493-1
00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:59.392
want to say that OK, if the
father buys a product, the son

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9493-2
00:44:59.392 --> 00:45:02.456
or daughter daughter is likely
to buy the product, so maybe

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9493-3
00:45:02.456 --> 00:45:05.520
that's a hypothesis that you
want to prove or disprove with

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9493-4
00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:05.979
the data.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9516-0
00:45:06.529 --> 00:45:10.331
But the question is that the
quality of hypothesis itself is

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9516-1
00:45:10.331 --> 00:45:12.699
always is so many times is a
problem.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9598-0
00:45:12.709 --> 00:45:17.085
It's not easy to get a good
hypothesis, and this hypothesis

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9598-1
00:45:17.085 --> 00:45:21.097
it the the hypothesis is
becoming even bigger problems

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9598-2
00:45:21.097 --> 00:45:25.474
when you are dealing with a
really a multi dimensional data

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9598-3
00:45:25.474 --> 00:45:29.558
because the data has a huge
dimensionality and then the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9598-4
00:45:29.558 --> 00:45:34.007
assuming that the damage the
attributes that you are dealing

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9598-5
00:45:34.007 --> 00:45:38.384
with are all independent uh,
creating a hypothesis that you

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9598-6
00:45:38.384 --> 00:45:41.739
want to prove or disprove is not
an easy job.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9617-0
00:45:41.749 --> 00:45:45.528
So if you got, if you appreciate
that point, I think possibly

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9617-1
00:45:45.528 --> 00:45:48.209
this example would have served
the purpose.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9622-0
00:45:51.539 --> 00:45:52.849
Yeah, exactly.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9671-0
00:45:52.859 --> 00:45:56.677
So I think like both the
hypothesis, the first one and

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9671-1
00:45:56.677 --> 00:46:01.051
the second one does make sense,
but test proving or disproving

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9671-2
00:46:01.051 --> 00:46:04.939
the first hypothesis is very
difficult because we can't

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9671-3
00:46:04.939 --> 00:46:08.549
verify the background of quarter
million of people.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9715-0
00:46:08.929 --> 00:46:12.740
But in the second case, there
are less number of people that

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9715-1
00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:16.801
we want to check the background
because it is even reader to see

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9715-2
00:46:16.801 --> 00:46:20.424
two arbitrary people in the same
hotel at three different

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9715-3
00:46:20.424 --> 00:46:21.049
instances.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9729-0
00:46:21.549 --> 00:46:25.697
So that is a little bit better
hypothesis that we can prove or

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9729-1
00:46:25.697 --> 00:46:26.289
disprove.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9736-0
00:46:28.189 --> 00:46:28.339
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9740-0
00:46:28.859 --> 00:46:29.769
OK, fine.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9751-0
00:46:29.119 --> 00:46:29.499
But two.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9745-0
00:46:29.879 --> 00:46:30.549
Fine, nothing.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9752-0
00:46:30.559 --> 00:46:31.289
I have nothing to say.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9755-0
00:46:31.299 --> 00:46:32.039
Yeah, sure. OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9764-0
00:46:36.439 --> 00:46:37.309
OK. OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9769-0
00:46:36.449 --> 00:46:37.199
There's no reference.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9795-0
00:46:37.319 --> 00:46:41.398
So so we got some idea that the
hypothesis itself can be the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9795-1
00:46:41.398 --> 00:46:45.611
culprit sometimes, but the data
is understanding the data is a

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9795-2
00:46:45.611 --> 00:46:47.349
is a challenge many times.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9800-0
00:46:48.059 --> 00:46:48.569
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9802-0
00:46:48.579 --> 00:46:49.619
So let's proceed further.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9821-0
00:46:54.999 --> 00:46:59.429
So we will look at really what
is known as data pipeline.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9835-0
00:46:59.439 --> 00:47:02.566
So in fact, we have briefly
looked at it in the first

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9835-1
00:47:02.566 --> 00:47:03.029
session.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9856-0
00:47:03.459 --> 00:47:06.666
I think in the first session let
me go to the slide deck that we

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9856-1
00:47:06.666 --> 00:47:07.949
used in the first session.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9858-0
00:47:08.359 --> 00:47:09.979
I think we had.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9877-0
00:47:12.409 --> 00:47:17.039
Kind of looked at, I think I had
looked at this is the.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9883-0
00:47:17.109 --> 00:47:18.649
This is the URL I had used.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9940-0
00:47:21.749 --> 00:47:25.419
SO11 quick question or
clarification so that Ben

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9900-0
00:47:23.499 --> 00:47:24.429
Yes, yes, go ahead.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9910-0
00:47:25.149 --> 00:47:25.699
Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9940-1
00:47:25.419 --> 00:47:29.838
Ferroni principle, whatever that
was, so that basically is

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9940-2
00:47:29.838 --> 00:47:33.882
pointing to the same that
hypothesis can have problem

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9940-3
00:47:33.882 --> 00:47:36.129
that's what that principle is.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9950-0
00:47:36.189 --> 00:47:36.999
Is that what we are saying?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9968-0
00:47:38.029 --> 00:47:43.173
Ohh and see what it is saying is
that if the data size is large

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9968-1
00:47:43.173 --> 00:47:44.459
it is a problem.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10017-0
00:47:44.469 --> 00:47:49.055
That is what it is saying when
the data size is large, you are

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9981-0
00:47:45.659 --> 00:47:46.009
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/9988-0
00:47:46.019 --> 00:47:46.609
That that.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10017-1
00:47:49.055 --> 00:47:53.349
you are going to run problems
with the false positives and

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10011-0
00:47:52.769 --> 00:47:54.199
That itself is that principle.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10017-2
00:47:53.349 --> 00:47:55.169
false negatives and yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10014-0
00:47:54.209 --> 00:47:54.479
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10019-0
00:47:54.869 --> 00:47:55.799
OK. OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10046-0
00:47:55.219 --> 00:48:01.465
And and So what it means is that
the you may find a very odd

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10027-0
00:47:55.809 --> 00:47:56.149
Thank you.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10046-1
00:48:01.465 --> 00:48:04.639
patterns also start showing up.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10055-0
00:48:03.829 --> 00:48:06.279
Yep, got it. Yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10049-0
00:48:05.309 --> 00:48:05.749
Uh.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10060-0
00:48:05.759 --> 00:48:07.879
Through randomness through
randomness.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10058-0
00:48:08.789 --> 00:48:09.229
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10061-0
00:48:09.369 --> 00:48:09.709
Thank you.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10066-0
00:48:12.409 --> 00:48:13.079
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10068-0
00:48:13.129 --> 00:48:13.659
So.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10081-0
00:48:13.709 --> 00:48:18.824
So we had seen the enterprise
data architecture, enterprise

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10081-1
00:48:18.824 --> 00:48:20.359
data architecture.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10083-0
00:48:20.609 --> 00:48:21.139
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10089-0
00:48:21.149 --> 00:48:21.659
Thank you.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10109-0
00:48:21.669 --> 00:48:25.738
Mr Raghavendra is actually
Professor Raghavendra, is one of

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10109-1
00:48:25.738 --> 00:48:28.519
the teaching assistants for the
section.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10119-0
00:48:28.869 --> 00:48:32.479
So Professor Ravindra, thank you
for joining this session.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10131-0
00:48:32.789 --> 00:48:34.499
So you can unmute yourself and
you can speak.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10134-0
00:48:34.509 --> 00:48:35.569
I think you are unmuted.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10147-0
00:48:38.729 --> 00:48:39.569
Ohh you look good.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10145-0
00:48:39.029 --> 00:48:39.499
Are you dead?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10151-0
00:48:40.999 --> 00:48:41.189
What?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10160-0
00:48:41.009 --> 00:48:41.539
You are dead.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10166-0
00:48:41.189 --> 00:48:42.129
Well, look, I'm good.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10164-0
00:48:41.549 --> 00:48:43.649
Like, OK, you are there.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10190-0
00:48:43.659 --> 00:48:46.748
So you can answer some of the
questions in the chat window if

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10190-1
00:48:46.748 --> 00:48:49.289
you if you see that anything
that you can clarify.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10193-0
00:48:52.309 --> 00:48:52.869
Yeah, alright.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10200-0
00:49:01.299 --> 00:49:01.879
Alright.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10219-0
00:49:01.929 --> 00:49:05.664
We look at the data pipelines is
in fact the concept is coming

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10219-1
00:49:05.664 --> 00:49:07.679
from the enterprise
architecture.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10249-0
00:49:07.869 --> 00:49:11.396
Enterprise have many types of
data sources, so we can say when

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10249-1
00:49:11.396 --> 00:49:14.979
you say relational database it
is not in a big enterprise which

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10249-2
00:49:14.979 --> 00:49:16.659
is a multinational enterprise.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10295-0
00:49:16.729 --> 00:49:20.360
It is possible that they may be
using four or five types of

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10295-1
00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:24.051
relational databases, and they
may be using ten types of non

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10295-2
00:49:24.051 --> 00:49:27.682
relational databases and they
may be using many, many other

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10295-3
00:49:27.682 --> 00:49:30.889
types of data stores and data
processing mechanisms.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10327-0
00:49:31.399 --> 00:49:36.409
So in that sense, when we have
this type of situation, so we

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10327-1
00:49:36.409 --> 00:49:41.502
need to be having data pipelines
in order to connect the data

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10327-2
00:49:41.502 --> 00:49:43.309
within the enterprise.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10340-0
00:49:43.619 --> 00:49:46.669
So that is the that is what we
want to briefly look at.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10354-0
00:49:47.019 --> 00:49:50.769
So the data pipelines they need
to perform several things.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10410-0
00:49:51.099 --> 00:49:56.036
For example, they they'll have
to do an extraction of the data

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10410-1
00:49:56.036 --> 00:50:00.581
from one source and may have to
validate the data and the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10410-2
00:50:00.581 --> 00:50:04.735
deliver the data to a
destination and and very often

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10410-3
00:50:04.735 --> 00:50:09.672
we associate the designation of
data engineers with respect to

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10410-4
00:50:09.672 --> 00:50:11.239
ohh with respect to.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10455-0
00:50:14.239 --> 00:50:18.728
Be be there with respect to the
people who perform the manage

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10455-1
00:50:18.728 --> 00:50:23.145
the data pipelines and one of
the skills that they expect is

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10455-2
00:50:23.145 --> 00:50:27.199
the SQL and they may have to
connect to data warehouse.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10491-0
00:50:27.209 --> 00:50:31.912
They may have to connect to data
leak and so they are going to

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10491-1
00:50:31.912 --> 00:50:36.615
produce the pipelines which are
connecting the various sources

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10491-2
00:50:36.615 --> 00:50:41.169
and one of the output that they
generate may be a dashboard.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10517-0
00:50:42.219 --> 00:50:47.769
So very often the organizations
require a dashboard that gives

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10517-1
00:50:47.769 --> 00:50:51.909
them a real picture of the
status of business.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10549-0
00:50:51.919 --> 00:50:56.544
So for many key parameters will
be there for many cxos say they

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10549-1
00:50:56.544 --> 00:51:00.518
will be looking for some the
business performance with

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10549-2
00:51:00.518 --> 00:51:02.469
respect to some parameters.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10594-0
00:51:02.779 --> 00:51:07.378
So in such cases you will have
to generate a dashboard through

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10594-1
00:51:07.378 --> 00:51:12.051
various data pipelines and then
that is going to be it can be a

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10594-2
00:51:12.051 --> 00:51:16.212
dashboard, can have many
metrics, not necessarily single

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10594-3
00:51:16.212 --> 00:51:19.789
metrics and that can come from
multiple sources.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10621-0
00:51:20.079 --> 00:51:25.850
So you need to have the ability
to perform they receive the data

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10621-1
00:51:25.850 --> 00:51:31.177
from multiple sources, clean
structure, normalize, combine,

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10621-2
00:51:31.177 --> 00:51:33.929
aggregate, anonymize or secure.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10633-0
00:51:34.029 --> 00:51:37.949
So now my question is that any
word which is troubling you.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10643-0
00:51:41.619 --> 00:51:42.709
Any word is troubling you.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10660-0
00:51:43.609 --> 00:51:44.999
What is anonymize here?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10665-0
00:51:45.159 --> 00:51:46.379
I know and no, no, right.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10684-0
00:51:45.879 --> 00:51:50.025
Anonymize is that sometimes the
data that you want to you may

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10684-1
00:51:50.025 --> 00:51:53.769
have the concern that you are
guaranteeing the privacy.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10716-0
00:51:54.039 --> 00:51:57.887
For example, when we take the
feedback about the course, we

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10716-1
00:51:57.887 --> 00:52:01.735
say that it is an anonymous
feedback, so we get the scores,

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10716-2
00:52:01.735 --> 00:52:04.429
but then we don't know what is
the score.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10729-0
00:52:04.439 --> 00:52:07.629
Similarly, there are many times
you have to anonymize the data.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10740-0
00:52:08.869 --> 00:52:11.389
Venkata is it like masking the
data.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10763-0
00:52:12.799 --> 00:52:17.305
One can be masking data, so
sometimes you may have to remove

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10763-1
00:52:17.305 --> 00:52:21.589
the, remove the users username
or the source of the data.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10778-0
00:52:21.659 --> 00:52:25.299
So it depends on the purpose for
which you're using it.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10806-0
00:52:25.599 --> 00:52:28.728
I'm not saying that for creating
a dashboard you need to

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10806-1
00:52:28.728 --> 00:52:31.802
anonymous, but then it may
require because the customer

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10806-2
00:52:31.802 --> 00:52:33.449
names should not be disclosed.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10835-0
00:52:33.559 --> 00:52:37.056
So for example, in a bank
balance, you want to know the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10835-1
00:52:37.056 --> 00:52:40.989
aggregate balances in a certain
branch, but obviously you are.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10851-0
00:52:41.029 --> 00:52:44.639
The bank is obliged to keep the,
let's say your balance secret.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10876-0
00:52:45.109 --> 00:52:48.059
So on except for your
relationship manager, they can

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10876-1
00:52:48.059 --> 00:52:51.509
make sure that other people will
not get to see your balance.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10886-0
00:52:53.629 --> 00:52:54.859
So that is one possibility.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10906-0
00:52:54.869 --> 00:52:58.051
I'm not sure whether all the
banks have the same rule or some

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10906-1
00:52:58.051 --> 00:52:58.359
banks.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10908-0
00:52:58.369 --> 00:52:58.719
Are they?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10934-0
00:52:58.729 --> 00:53:01.934
I don't know what is the rule,
but then when you have to

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10934-1
00:53:01.934 --> 00:53:05.139
maintain the confidentiality,
yes it becomes a required.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10941-0
00:53:05.689 --> 00:53:08.089
Uh, I hope we are In Sync.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10967-0
00:53:09.749 --> 00:53:12.617
Can you please go back to the
slide for a moment there any

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10965-0
00:53:12.469 --> 00:53:13.839
OK, go back to this slide.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10967-1
00:53:12.617 --> 00:53:12.909
other?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10969-0
00:53:13.849 --> 00:53:15.929
I'm going back, yes.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10972-0
00:53:19.009 --> 00:53:19.419
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10975-0
00:53:19.469 --> 00:53:19.909
Thank you.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10982-0
00:53:21.459 --> 00:53:22.949
OK, I think we are fine.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/10994-0
00:53:22.959 --> 00:53:24.589
So we are going to the next.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11006-0
00:53:24.059 --> 00:53:27.819
Just so just one one doubt
please.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11008-0
00:53:24.699 --> 00:53:26.539
So what is yes.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11010-0
00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:28.139
Sorry.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11019-0
00:53:28.149 --> 00:53:30.019
Uh, will you be able to?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11026-0
00:53:29.099 --> 00:53:29.679
Yeah, it worked.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11031-0
00:53:30.529 --> 00:53:32.179
What do you mean by normalized?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11040-0
00:53:33.199 --> 00:53:36.169
See, the normalized is
interesting phenomenon.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11046-0
00:53:36.009 --> 00:53:36.189
No.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11078-0
00:53:36.379 --> 00:53:41.341
So we we get the data from many
of many parameters and sometimes

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11078-1
00:53:41.341 --> 00:53:46.150
what we want to do is that we
need to combine them in order to

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11062-0
00:53:41.469 --> 00:53:41.679
Umm.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11078-2
00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:47.829
get a suitable result.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11089-0
00:53:48.179 --> 00:53:51.079
So suppose that there is a.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11084-0
00:53:48.389 --> 00:53:48.609
Umm.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11126-0
00:53:51.139 --> 00:53:54.988
There is a there is a gadget
that is that you have to sell

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11126-1
00:53:54.988 --> 00:53:58.251
and do you think that two
parameters are going to

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11110-0
00:53:55.629 --> 00:53:55.929
In.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11126-2
00:53:58.251 --> 00:54:01.839
different decide whether the
person will buy a gadget.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11136-0
00:54:01.849 --> 00:54:03.219
One is easy and other is inco.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11142-0
00:54:03.929 --> 00:54:04.179
Umm.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11166-0
00:54:04.049 --> 00:54:09.550
Years of your potential
customers is 20 to 80 and income

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11158-0
00:54:08.439 --> 00:54:08.819
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11166-1
00:54:09.550 --> 00:54:13.989
of your potential customers is
10,200 crores.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11203-0
00:54:14.359 --> 00:54:18.234
So now do you see the problem
when you want to combine the two

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11230-0
00:54:18.149 --> 00:54:22.995
Yeah, the yes, yes, you have a
very huge, huge amount of, you

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11203-1
00:54:18.234 --> 00:54:20.079
Mr Saurabh, DC DC the problem.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11230-1
00:54:22.995 --> 00:54:27.919
know, the the what you 100,000
something you told right salary

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11252-0
00:54:27.559 --> 00:54:31.619
Income range income range can be
much bigger than the age range.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11230-2
00:54:27.919 --> 00:54:29.169
8, income range.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11233-0
00:54:29.179 --> 00:54:29.539
Yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11238-0
00:54:29.549 --> 00:54:29.919
Yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11254-0
00:54:29.989 --> 00:54:31.619
So that is out of range, right?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11272-0
00:54:31.829 --> 00:54:33.429
You meant to say that is out of
range.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11300-0
00:54:31.939 --> 00:54:35.195
So so you still have to, you
have to combine the two in order

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11300-1
00:54:35.195 --> 00:54:38.293
to get because what we are
saying is we think is that both

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11300-2
00:54:38.293 --> 00:54:40.709
the attributes are important for
your gadget.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11301-0
00:54:41.409 --> 00:54:41.959
Umm.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11306-0
00:54:42.009 --> 00:54:43.679
Then, Venkat said.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11312-0
00:54:43.689 --> 00:54:44.639
I'm I'm very much sorry.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11347-0
00:54:44.649 --> 00:54:48.543
Just I'm just out of curiosity
then in such cases we have to

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11347-1
00:54:48.543 --> 00:54:52.309
just ignore such type of data
which is out of range right?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11356-0
00:54:52.269 --> 00:54:53.939
No, no, there is nothing like
out of range.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11361-0
00:54:52.389 --> 00:54:53.429
To make the things so.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11364-0
00:54:53.949 --> 00:54:54.979
No, no, Mr Gautam.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11376-0
00:54:55.189 --> 00:54:57.159
Mr Saurav, there is nothing is
out of range.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11373-0
00:54:55.349 --> 00:54:55.599
Umm.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11426-0
00:54:57.409 --> 00:55:00.537
So I am saying you have
customers who have got income

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11426-1
00:55:00.537 --> 00:55:04.013
from 10,000 rupees, 200 crore
rupees and you have customers

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11411-0
00:55:03.169 --> 00:55:03.629
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11426-2
00:55:04.013 --> 00:55:07.662
who are in their range of 20 to
80 and your gadget for selling

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11428-0
00:55:06.359 --> 00:55:06.819
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11426-3
00:55:07.662 --> 00:55:08.299
the gadget.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11435-0
00:55:08.309 --> 00:55:09.629
You think that both are
important.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11445-0
00:55:09.639 --> 00:55:11.499
That is what you think there is.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11450-0
00:55:10.139 --> 00:55:11.059
Umm OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11455-0
00:55:11.549 --> 00:55:12.989
That is what many times happens,
right?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11463-0
00:55:13.619 --> 00:55:14.319
Yes, yes.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11495-0
00:55:13.989 --> 00:55:17.339
So now you have to combine these
two to give a result of yes or

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11488-0
00:55:16.639 --> 00:55:19.339
Umm, yeah yeah, I understood.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11495-1
00:55:17.339 --> 00:55:19.799
no whether this person is going
to buy or not.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11496-0
00:55:19.349 --> 00:55:20.539
So that, yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11517-0
00:55:20.549 --> 00:55:23.441
So that's what normalization we
are doing trying to do to make

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11520-0
00:55:22.989 --> 00:55:24.939
You you have to do how to do it.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11517-1
00:55:23.441 --> 00:55:23.579
it.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11542-0
00:55:24.549 --> 00:55:26.759
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11558-0
00:55:24.949 --> 00:55:27.570
We you don't worry about it, but
some normalization we have to do

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11545-0
00:55:26.769 --> 00:55:26.989
God.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11558-1
00:55:27.570 --> 00:55:29.039
before you can combine that
correct.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11549-0
00:55:28.559 --> 00:55:29.359
Yeah, got it.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11553-0
00:55:29.409 --> 00:55:29.919
Got it.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11556-0
00:55:29.929 --> 00:55:30.559
Got it, Sir.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11561-0
00:55:30.769 --> 00:55:31.159
Thank you.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11566-0
00:55:31.019 --> 00:55:31.319
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11563-0
00:55:31.169 --> 00:55:31.679
Yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11568-0
00:55:31.769 --> 00:55:32.429
Please proceed. Yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11580-0
00:55:36.689 --> 00:55:40.359
Alright, so the pipeline will
have several stages.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11601-0
00:55:40.669 --> 00:55:44.401
So as we discussed, the pipeline
will connecting the mini data

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11601-1
00:55:44.401 --> 00:55:46.059
sources and mini data syncs.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11681-0
00:55:46.409 --> 00:55:51.279
So we need to take extract right
there is a pipeline will extract

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11681-1
00:55:51.279 --> 00:55:55.706
data from one source using
several mechanisms and there may

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11681-2
00:55:55.706 --> 00:55:59.764
be multiple steps involved in
extraction and then data

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11681-3
00:55:59.764 --> 00:56:03.970
preprocessing can involve any
type of processing that we

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11681-4
00:56:03.970 --> 00:56:08.766
talked about then validation and
then we need to run the machine

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11681-5
00:56:08.766 --> 00:56:13.340
learning model on the data and
then the model may be the what

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11681-6
00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:15.849
the final consumer is looking
at.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11695-0
00:56:19.169 --> 00:56:24.989
And and then we are talking
about the data ingestion.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11732-0
00:56:26.309 --> 00:56:31.158
Uh refers to the extracting data
from one source, so this is the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11732-1
00:56:31.158 --> 00:56:35.635
and then I think these are all
the examples of tools, so we

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11732-2
00:56:35.635 --> 00:56:37.649
don't need to go into that.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11757-0
00:56:38.009 --> 00:56:42.465
So typically we'll have the
pipelines will be of the type

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11757-1
00:56:42.465 --> 00:56:44.769
two types, 2 broad types, ETL.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11766-0
00:56:46.279 --> 00:56:47.899
Or 80.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11798-0
00:56:49.379 --> 00:56:54.617
So typically ETL is something
big which puts the data into a

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11798-1
00:56:54.617 --> 00:56:59.511
structured data sync like
warehouse which can give you a

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11798-2
00:56:59.511 --> 00:57:04.319
enable, a OLAP processing or the
business intelligence.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11850-0
00:57:06.269 --> 00:57:10.916
And then ELT is generally the
sink is more of the form of data

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11850-1
00:57:10.916 --> 00:57:15.416
leak, which takes the data of
any type and just holds it and

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11850-2
00:57:15.416 --> 00:57:20.136
you transform it only when you
need to start working with it or

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11850-3
00:57:20.136 --> 00:57:21.169
processing it.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11861-0
00:57:21.299 --> 00:57:23.359
But then this is not really a
rule.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11886-0
00:57:23.549 --> 00:57:27.440
So what we are saying is that we
can have two types of the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11886-1
00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:31.199
pipelines which are doing ETL
sequence or eltc sequence.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11902-0
00:57:36.499 --> 00:57:38.779
So can you please give an
example for ELT?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11912-0
00:57:38.849 --> 00:57:39.339
You know.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11944-0
00:57:40.189 --> 00:57:44.189
No, that is what now ELT is
saying that we are putting the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11944-1
00:57:44.189 --> 00:57:48.460
data into somewhere and do the
transformation later so that we

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11944-2
00:57:48.460 --> 00:57:52.189
will get the pattern or or graph
or whatever you want.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11972-0
00:57:54.659 --> 00:57:58.445
So transform you postpone in ELT
and in ETL, you first perform

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11972-1
00:57:58.445 --> 00:58:01.329
the transform and then only you
do the loading.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11975-0
00:58:02.159 --> 00:58:02.639
Is that clear?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11985-0
00:58:03.599 --> 00:58:06.369
So where is data warehouse in
ELT?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/11996-0
00:58:07.769 --> 00:58:11.429
No, no data warehouse is acting
as a sink in this case.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12026-0
00:58:11.849 --> 00:58:14.915
So because there are data from
many sources and you want to put

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12026-1
00:58:14.915 --> 00:58:17.694
them in data warehouse because
data warehouse is used for

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12026-2
00:58:17.694 --> 00:58:18.939
online analytical process.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12034-0
00:58:22.069 --> 00:58:22.809
Is that clear?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12036-0
00:58:22.859 --> 00:58:24.009
Or still some questions?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12039-0
00:58:26.699 --> 00:58:27.049
Yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12060-0
00:58:27.059 --> 00:58:31.208
So like when we say that data
warehouse will be used for

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12060-1
00:58:31.208 --> 00:58:32.809
analytical processing.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12107-0
00:58:32.899 --> 00:58:37.475
So for ETL like the data
warehouse is the last step right

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12107-1
00:58:37.475 --> 00:58:42.445
where the data gets loaded in
data warehouse and that there it

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12089-0
00:58:40.099 --> 00:58:40.969
That is right.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12100-0
00:58:41.059 --> 00:58:41.879
That is right, yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12107-2
00:58:42.445 --> 00:58:44.969
can be used for OLAP processing.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12117-0
00:58:44.919 --> 00:58:45.459
Yeah, right.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12150-0
00:58:45.039 --> 00:58:49.732
But when it comes to ELT there,
I mean I understand that, OK,

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12150-1
00:58:49.732 --> 00:58:54.349
like after extraction the data
is being put in Data Lake and

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12150-2
00:58:54.349 --> 00:58:57.149
then transformation is happening
so.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12141-0
00:58:54.769 --> 00:58:55.029
Umm.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12168-0
00:58:56.739 --> 00:59:00.299
Transformation can be of various
types and it can be by various

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12168-1
00:59:00.299 --> 00:59:03.025
syncs and each sync may have a
different type of

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12168-2
00:59:03.025 --> 00:59:03.859
transformation.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12171-0
00:59:05.479 --> 00:59:05.769
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12185-0
00:59:05.779 --> 00:59:09.508
And are we saying that after
transformation the data will go

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12185-1
00:59:09.508 --> 00:59:10.119
to the uh?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12216-0
00:59:12.149 --> 00:59:15.229
Data warehouse where OLAP can
happen in ELT as well.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12209-0
00:59:13.569 --> 00:59:15.059
No, no, no, no, no, no.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12235-0
00:59:15.069 --> 00:59:19.500
When we say ELT, we are trying
to say that we first load the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12269-0
00:59:17.069 --> 00:59:17.379
Umm.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12235-1
00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:21.679
data into the into some place.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12252-0
00:59:21.769 --> 00:59:24.631
So which is, let's say data leak
without doing any

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12252-1
00:59:24.631 --> 00:59:25.529
transformations.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12268-0
00:59:25.539 --> 00:59:29.134
So it is more like a raw data
and then transformation will be

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12268-1
00:59:29.134 --> 00:59:30.409
done when you need it.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12286-0
00:59:33.019 --> 00:59:34.929
So where is OLAP happening in
ELT?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12314-0
00:59:35.879 --> 00:59:39.701
No, we know OLAP OLAP may not
happen in the Lt because he OLAP

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12314-1
00:59:39.701 --> 00:59:43.099
requests that the data is
structured and is as per some

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12314-2
00:59:43.099 --> 00:59:44.009
certain format.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12322-0
00:59:44.019 --> 00:59:46.339
Because data warehouse you know
is typically relational.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12331-0
00:59:49.919 --> 00:59:50.389
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12339-0
00:59:50.139 --> 00:59:50.579
Is that clear?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12334-0
00:59:50.699 --> 00:59:51.049
Got it.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12337-0
00:59:51.099 --> 00:59:51.729
Yep, Yep.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12340-0
00:59:51.739 --> 00:59:52.059
Thank you.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12368-0
00:59:53.979 --> 00:59:59.065
By that way, ELO process would
be would be more faster than

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12368-1
00:59:59.065 --> 01:00:01.439
than the ETL process, right?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12372-0
01:00:02.099 --> 01:00:03.969
Yeah, possible that is quite
possible, right?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12373-0
01:00:04.939 --> 01:00:05.289
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12381-0
01:00:12.059 --> 01:00:13.929
OK, so there's nothing here.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12395-0
01:00:13.969 --> 01:00:17.667
So we are talking about
transformation can require

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12395-1
01:00:17.667 --> 01:00:19.189
analytical knowledge.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12434-0
01:00:19.619 --> 01:00:24.703
So you may involve somebody who
has expertise in how the data is

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12434-1
01:00:24.703 --> 01:00:29.474
used for various purposes, but
extract and load maybe simply

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12434-2
01:00:29.474 --> 01:00:34.010
set of scripts or programs so
that a data engineer may be

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12434-3
01:00:34.010 --> 01:00:34.949
better here.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12459-0
01:00:35.639 --> 01:00:38.968
But then I'll leave it because
the companies can have

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12459-1
01:00:38.968 --> 01:00:42.791
designations of various kinds,
so it is just a secretive kind

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12459-2
01:00:42.791 --> 01:00:43.469
of picture.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12534-0
01:00:45.679 --> 01:00:50.353
And we need to orchestrate the
pipelines so the pipelines are

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12534-1
01:00:50.353 --> 01:00:55.177
are because they are controlled
so, so, so many times there are

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12534-2
01:00:55.177 --> 01:00:59.699
data sources from which you
cannot pull out the data during

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12534-3
01:00:59.699 --> 01:01:04.298
certain hours because you cannot
guarantee sistance accepted

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12534-4
01:01:04.298 --> 01:01:08.443
certain point of time and then
it is possible that for

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12534-5
01:01:08.443 --> 01:01:12.740
performance reasons also they do
not allow you to do the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12534-6
01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:13.569
extraction.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12537-0
01:01:14.719 --> 01:01:15.409
Uh.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12569-0
01:01:15.419 --> 01:01:20.313
During the during certain hours,
so there can be several things

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12569-1
01:01:20.313 --> 01:01:24.595
and orchestration may also
involve several aspects with

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12569-2
01:01:24.595 --> 01:01:27.959
respect to managing as the what
data flows.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12583-0
01:01:34.279 --> 01:01:38.619
And and the the data sources can
be innumerable.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12580-0
01:01:36.189 --> 01:01:36.559
Most.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12607-0
01:01:38.709 --> 01:01:42.323
So this is the example the our
colleague has taken from

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12588-0
01:01:38.799 --> 01:01:38.979
Right.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12600-0
01:01:39.119 --> 01:01:39.679
Is there any?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12607-1
01:01:42.323 --> 01:01:42.839
Tableau.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12635-0
01:01:42.989 --> 01:01:46.229
So this is just a giving an
indication that there is a large

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12620-0
01:01:43.369 --> 01:01:43.669
Step.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12635-1
01:01:46.229 --> 01:01:48.779
number of possible sources that
you talk about.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12655-0
01:01:48.969 --> 01:01:53.204
So and but there are tools which
deal with these hundreds of

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12652-0
01:01:50.059 --> 01:01:51.239
The artist is.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12655-1
01:01:53.204 --> 01:01:53.759
sources.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12657-0
01:01:53.829 --> 01:01:54.359
Effective.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12666-0
01:01:54.949 --> 01:01:56.649
OK, someone is having a
question.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12691-0
01:01:58.289 --> 01:02:01.874
I said I did not get the how to
orchestrating the data there

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12691-1
01:02:01.874 --> 01:02:02.109
and.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12716-0
01:02:01.879 --> 01:02:05.986
No, no, I did not discuss even
because orchestrating is that in

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12716-1
01:02:05.986 --> 01:02:10.094
the pipeline, we may have to do
the management depending on the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12716-2
01:02:10.094 --> 01:02:12.789
source and sync and the data
requirement.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12726-0
01:02:12.979 --> 01:02:16.329
So so the orchestration can be
something.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12746-0
01:02:16.339 --> 01:02:19.623
For example, you want to stop
the data at certain place or

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12746-1
01:02:19.623 --> 01:02:20.569
allow it to flow.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12778-0
01:02:20.579 --> 01:02:23.904
It's a 10 place you want to
buffer it at certain certain

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12778-1
01:02:23.904 --> 01:02:27.696
things, and you may control the
flows to certain places so there

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12778-2
01:02:27.696 --> 01:02:28.979
can be several things.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12794-0
01:02:35.979 --> 01:02:40.239
OK, so so now I hope.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12784-0
01:02:36.589 --> 01:02:36.949
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12796-0
01:02:39.689 --> 01:02:41.279
And just one more thing.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12811-0
01:02:41.289 --> 01:02:44.959
So the ETL and the E ELT that
you have explained.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12821-0
01:02:44.969 --> 01:02:47.659
So is it like both other ways?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12833-0
01:02:47.669 --> 01:02:51.089
Can we followed up to do the
whole app transformation?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12849-0
01:02:51.919 --> 01:02:55.545
No, OLAP is not the only only
way in which we do the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12849-1
01:02:55.545 --> 01:02:56.229
analytics.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12866-0
01:02:56.239 --> 01:03:00.214
For example, Data Lake, we can
directly use for performing many

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12866-1
01:03:00.214 --> 01:03:01.829
of the data science tasks.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12894-0
01:03:01.839 --> 01:03:05.007
We can straight away take the
data from data leak and start

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12894-1
01:03:05.007 --> 01:03:07.910
doing it, but in that case we
need to do many types of

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12894-2
01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:08.649
preprocessing.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12903-0
01:03:08.659 --> 01:03:11.289
Each preprocessing for each task
can be varying.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12929-0
01:03:11.619 --> 01:03:14.200
For example, if you are trying
to do a regression, you may do a

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12929-1
01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:15.369
preprocessing in certain way.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12976-0
01:03:15.379 --> 01:03:20.054
If you want to do clustering,
you may do it in different way,

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12976-1
01:03:20.054 --> 01:03:24.729
so there can be many types of
preprocessing that you may have

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12976-2
01:03:24.729 --> 01:03:29.631
to do and depending on the types
of targets or the types of goal

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12976-3
01:03:29.631 --> 01:03:31.139
that you have to do.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12978-0
01:03:31.919 --> 01:03:32.259
Uh.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12985-0
01:03:32.299 --> 01:03:33.509
Is that is that?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12988-0
01:03:33.359 --> 01:03:33.679
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12992-0
01:03:33.519 --> 01:03:34.479
Does that clarify or?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/12995-0
01:03:35.709 --> 01:03:36.149
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13023-0
01:03:36.159 --> 01:03:40.558
So that you mean, so ETL and ELT
is one of those processes of

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13023-1
01:03:40.558 --> 01:03:43.609
doing that kind of
transformation, I mean.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13025-0
01:03:42.319 --> 01:03:45.349
See that T is standing for
transformation?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13039-0
01:03:45.359 --> 01:03:47.789
I said that that can also be a
preprocessing.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13036-0
01:03:46.649 --> 01:03:46.889
Right.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13071-0
01:03:48.219 --> 01:03:51.090
The preprocessing is that for
example, you want to build a

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13049-0
01:03:48.999 --> 01:03:49.259
Right.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13071-1
01:03:51.090 --> 01:03:54.058
classifier and beerby you will
predict whether somebody will

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13071-2
01:03:54.058 --> 01:03:56.539
buy the gadget that your company
has manufactured.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13104-0
01:03:57.359 --> 01:04:01.044
So now the question is that that
is a that you are trying to

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13084-0
01:03:57.609 --> 01:03:58.569
Right, right, right.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13104-1
01:04:01.044 --> 01:04:04.609
build a classifier for that you
need to you need the data.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13135-0
01:04:04.679 --> 01:04:08.190
The data may be available in
data leak, but for performing

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13124-0
01:04:08.139 --> 01:04:08.459
Umm.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13135-1
01:04:08.190 --> 01:04:11.820
your task you may need to do
many preprocessing steps before

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13135-2
01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:13.189
you can go do the task.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13145-0
01:04:13.719 --> 01:04:14.239
Does that help?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13143-0
01:04:15.319 --> 01:04:15.929
Right, right.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13148-0
01:04:15.979 --> 01:04:16.489
It helps us.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13155-0
01:04:16.499 --> 01:04:17.119
Thank you, Sir. Thank.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13156-0
01:04:16.609 --> 01:04:18.419
OK, OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13168-0
01:04:18.429 --> 01:04:21.579
So now what we do is we are more
than one hour.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13174-0
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:23.209
So let us take a 5 minute break.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13299-0
01:09:20.169 --> 01:09:21.569
Let's get restarted.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13320-0
01:09:33.439 --> 01:09:37.649
So we want to understand the
data with the help of some

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13320-1
01:09:37.649 --> 01:09:39.529
statistical descriptions.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13340-0
01:09:40.099 --> 01:09:45.861
So we that uh, the data first
has to be understood before we

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13340-1
01:09:45.861 --> 01:09:47.089
can model it.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13358-0
01:09:47.459 --> 01:09:51.053
So let us see what are the
common ways in which we can

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13358-1
01:09:51.053 --> 01:09:52.229
describe the data.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13372-0
01:09:52.719 --> 01:09:56.686
OK, so so the what is the
purpose of creating the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13372-1
01:09:56.686 --> 01:09:58.669
statistical descriptions?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13391-0
01:10:01.259 --> 01:10:05.977
But was for this motivation is
understanding the central

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13391-1
01:10:05.977 --> 01:10:08.129
tendency variation spread.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13403-0
01:10:08.959 --> 01:10:15.889
So so how how are we capturing
uh, the characteristics?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13411-0
01:10:16.119 --> 01:10:19.679
So the common measures include
all of these.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13440-0
01:10:24.679 --> 01:10:32.153
Be min, Max, median and I I hope
other one which is not put but

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13440-1
01:10:32.153 --> 01:10:38.109
then mean is common right and
mood is also common.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13454-0
01:10:40.429 --> 01:10:44.989
Mood is the most frequently what
is the value it takes? OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13460-0
01:10:46.659 --> 01:10:48.489
And so.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13492-0
01:10:48.539 --> 01:10:54.895
So this is going to help us if
we have got the understood it

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13492-1
01:10:54.895 --> 01:11:01.355
with the the certain precision
when we are able to analyze it

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13492-2
01:11:01.355 --> 01:11:04.689
with certain level of precision.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13520-0
01:11:05.059 --> 01:11:11.528
So this is really a challenge
because the granularity is very

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13520-1
01:11:11.528 --> 01:11:17.789
often achieved only way for we
have a large volume of data.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13553-0
01:11:20.949 --> 01:11:28.151
And and then sometimes we may
have to convert the majors into

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13553-1
01:11:28.151 --> 01:11:34.424
some form of numerical
dimensions in order to be able

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13553-2
01:11:34.424 --> 01:11:36.979
to express that using.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13562-0
01:11:39.039 --> 01:11:40.859
Using the statistical
descriptions.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13588-0
01:11:43.509 --> 01:11:47.659
And we are going to see what is
the meaning of box plot and what

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13588-1
01:11:47.659 --> 01:11:50.979
is the meaning of quantile
analysis in a short way.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13606-0
01:11:55.519 --> 01:11:58.949
So let us look at the
definitions for sitting in the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13606-1
01:11:58.949 --> 01:12:01.149
measurements of central
tendency.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13649-0
01:12:02.469 --> 01:12:08.208
So this is representing the mean
X bar very often many authors

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13649-1
01:12:08.208 --> 01:12:13.218
write, but don't be surprised if
somebody uses another

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13649-2
01:12:13.218 --> 01:12:19.138
nomenclature, but the mean is we
are taking let's say there is a

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13649-3
01:12:19.138 --> 01:12:20.869
sample of size 100.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13676-0
01:12:21.219 --> 01:12:26.407
Ohh element so one by yen, then
multiplied by the sum of the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13676-1
01:12:26.407 --> 01:12:29.639
elements so that is going to be
mean.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13692-0
01:12:29.889 --> 01:12:34.939
So when it is for the entire
population, some authors use MU.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13712-0
01:12:35.649 --> 01:12:39.102
So in that case, some of the
values for all the population

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13712-1
01:12:39.102 --> 01:12:41.619
and divided by the size of the
population.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13726-0
01:12:43.579 --> 01:12:47.929
And so small and it's sample and
begin is population size.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13733-0
01:12:47.939 --> 01:12:49.849
So this is a convention.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13768-0
01:12:49.859 --> 01:12:53.953
So, but don't be don't be
disappointed if somebody doesn't

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13768-1
01:12:53.953 --> 01:12:58.393
follow that strictly, but there
is a interesting thing that you

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13768-2
01:12:58.393 --> 01:13:02.279
may want to do is to create a
weighted arithmetic mean.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13777-0
01:13:06.809 --> 01:13:09.309
So by creating the weights.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13802-0
01:13:10.119 --> 01:13:15.509
Ohh So what you are saying is
that you are trying to give more

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13802-1
01:13:15.509 --> 01:13:20.556
importance to certain elements
in the data compared to the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13802-2
01:13:20.556 --> 01:13:21.069
other.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13817-0
01:13:22.629 --> 01:13:26.559
There is also a concept that you
may use.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13840-0
01:13:26.569 --> 01:13:33.488
A trim would mean and this is a
example, is a is for example, in

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13840-1
01:13:33.488 --> 01:13:37.639
Olympics there are for certain
events.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13855-0
01:13:38.209 --> 01:13:43.449
Suppose that there are 7 judges
and they give a score like this.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13867-0
01:14:02.939 --> 01:14:04.369
So there are seven judges.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13876-0
01:14:04.379 --> 01:14:07.349
They give the scores to some
gymnast like this.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13917-0
01:14:07.649 --> 01:14:12.760
So what they do is that they
chop this and they chop this and

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13917-1
01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:17.541
they take the average of this
and say that the gymnast is

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13917-2
01:14:17.541 --> 01:14:19.519
getting a score of 8.33.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13920-0
01:14:23.799 --> 01:14:24.659
So.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13942-0
01:14:24.719 --> 01:14:29.505
So what they think is that these
some very low scores are very

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13942-1
01:14:29.505 --> 01:14:29.809
low.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13972-0
01:14:29.819 --> 01:14:34.494
High scores may have been may
have some element of bias, so

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13972-1
01:14:34.494 --> 01:14:39.169
they would rather take a chop
off some of them and take the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13972-2
01:14:39.169 --> 01:14:41.429
mean of the remaining scores.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13983-0
01:14:45.979 --> 01:14:48.229
The median is an interesting
number.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/13989-0
01:14:48.499 --> 01:14:49.989
We had talked about it.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14000-0
01:14:49.999 --> 01:14:52.749
So when we have certain values.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14011-0
01:14:53.199 --> 01:14:58.549
So suppose that there is a town
and we are looking at.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14020-0
01:14:59.319 --> 01:15:02.019
Let's take the example of
income.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14072-0
01:15:02.029 --> 01:15:07.093
There is an example of ages
right below, so let's look at

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14072-1
01:15:07.093 --> 01:15:12.243
the the let's say 10K is the
salary of some people, 11K of

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14072-2
01:15:12.243 --> 01:15:17.569
somebody 12K of somebody, then
13 K of somebody and then and

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14072-3
01:15:17.569 --> 01:15:20.799
then somebody has an income of
100K.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14085-0
01:15:23.059 --> 01:15:27.959
This is the income of the people
in a small town.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14091-0
01:15:28.779 --> 01:15:30.079
So what will be the mean?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14129-0
01:15:32.179 --> 01:15:37.840
If this is the entire
population, what you get is a

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14129-1
01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:42.739
2535 forty 646 / 5 is the mean
is 146 right?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14138-0
01:15:42.799 --> 01:15:45.259
So it is 29.2.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14166-0
01:15:45.539 --> 01:15:50.515
This is the main so this doesn't
seem to represent the city, the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14166-1
01:15:50.515 --> 01:15:55.109
population of the area well, but
this is the middle number.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14178-0
01:15:55.639 --> 01:15:59.692
This may be a better
representation of the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14178-1
01:15:59.692 --> 01:16:00.729
population.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14240-0
01:16:00.739 --> 01:16:05.829
The income of the people, so
which is the median so median

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14240-1
01:16:05.829 --> 01:16:11.091
has the advantage that it can
reject the extreme presence of

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14240-2
01:16:11.091 --> 01:16:16.698
extreme values and stick to the
core data and then stay with the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14240-3
01:16:16.698 --> 01:16:21.442
central tendency of the core
data where by eliminating

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14240-4
01:16:21.442 --> 01:16:24.979
automatically trimming out the
extremes.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14248-0
01:16:26.329 --> 01:16:28.029
Uh, so far are we good?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14252-0
01:16:33.159 --> 01:16:33.499
Ohk.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14254-0
01:16:33.509 --> 01:16:34.319
OK, OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14261-0
01:16:34.329 --> 01:16:36.179
I think thank you for.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14263-0
01:16:36.279 --> 01:16:36.709
Yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14266-0
01:16:36.719 --> 01:16:37.069
Thank you.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14275-0
01:16:37.079 --> 01:16:38.869
There are some questions which
have been answered.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14278-0
01:16:38.879 --> 01:16:39.459
OK, good.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14283-0
01:16:40.429 --> 01:16:42.639
Alright, so so fine.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14293-0
01:16:43.149 --> 01:16:45.459
Uh, Mr Soumya charandas.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14308-0
01:16:45.689 --> 01:16:50.829
You think the median is a is a
different, different thing 11.5.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14313-0
01:16:51.139 --> 01:16:51.599
No, no.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14322-0
01:16:51.609 --> 01:16:55.699
There are five numbers, so 1011,
twelve 1300.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14329-0
01:16:56.169 --> 01:16:59.049
So the median will be 12, right?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14334-0
01:17:02.259 --> 01:17:03.699
Mr Sonya, are you fine?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14344-0
01:17:09.239 --> 01:17:10.419
You know various 5 1/2.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14355-0
01:17:12.599 --> 01:17:14.409
There are five elements, not
five and half.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14357-0
01:17:24.189 --> 01:17:24.379
Umm.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14361-0
01:17:27.149 --> 01:17:27.929
OK, fine.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14364-0
01:17:27.939 --> 01:17:28.259
Thank you.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14367-0
01:17:28.269 --> 01:17:28.599
Thank you.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14370-0
01:17:28.609 --> 01:17:28.959
Thank you.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14373-0
01:17:28.969 --> 01:17:29.759
Yeah, alright.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14378-0
01:17:29.839 --> 01:17:31.759
OK, OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14393-0
01:17:31.889 --> 01:17:36.619
So so now, now let us say ohh,
OK that is fine now.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14403-0
01:17:36.629 --> 01:17:39.379
So I had muted you in the break.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14420-0
01:17:39.449 --> 01:17:43.589
So do you want me to give a you
want me to open that, let's say.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14422-0
01:17:45.009 --> 01:17:45.369
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14430-0
01:17:49.059 --> 01:17:50.629
OK, let us proceed further.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14438-0
01:17:50.639 --> 01:17:52.269
I think everything is clear so
forth.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14459-0
01:17:52.939 --> 01:17:56.723
So now we may have a different
situation, so we are not getting

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14459-1
01:17:56.723 --> 01:17:57.669
individual data.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14471-0
01:17:57.679 --> 01:18:01.289
We have only got a histogram, so
the histogram plot is like this.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14478-0
01:18:02.249 --> 01:18:04.399
So so the histogram.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14486-0
01:18:04.469 --> 01:18:07.379
We can plot plot for this data.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14495-0
01:18:07.949 --> 01:18:10.399
So histogram is telling us this.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14511-0
01:18:10.789 --> 01:18:16.959
So with the one to five, they
are 200 people 6 to 15.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14530-0
01:18:31.459 --> 01:18:37.389
Then 16 to 20 there are
different ranges that 21 to 50.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14549-0
01:18:48.209 --> 01:18:52.799
And 51 to 80 and 81 to 110.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14569-0
01:18:52.839 --> 01:18:56.709
OK, so now what we are saying is
that there are 200 people here.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14579-0
01:18:58.489 --> 01:19:01.529
Then there are 450 people in
this range.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14609-0
01:19:03.609 --> 01:19:08.526
And 300 people in this range
then 1500 people in this range

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14609-1
01:19:08.526 --> 01:19:13.279
and 700 people in this range and
44 people in this range.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14624-0
01:19:13.429 --> 01:19:17.219
So now you have got a histogram,
but you need to get the median.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14655-0
01:19:17.529 --> 01:19:21.707
So now what you know is that the
median number is such that there

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14655-1
01:19:21.707 --> 01:19:25.569
will be more as many people
above it at as many people below

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14655-2
01:19:25.569 --> 01:19:25.759
it.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14671-0
01:19:26.089 --> 01:19:29.399
So first you need to find which
range is capturing the medium.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14701-0
01:19:29.789 --> 01:19:35.224
So now you have a total number
of population that you can make

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14701-1
01:19:35.224 --> 01:19:38.589
which is 206, fifty 950 and then
1650.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14712-0
01:19:38.879 --> 01:19:41.819
So the median will be within
this interval, right?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14754-0
01:19:41.889 --> 01:19:45.122
So when you compute it, because
this is a broad, it is going to

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14754-1
01:19:45.122 --> 01:19:48.456
capture it, and once you do that
then you will compute the median

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14754-2
01:19:48.456 --> 01:19:51.234
using this varial one is
representing the lower end of

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14754-3
01:19:51.234 --> 01:19:51.739
the range.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14767-0
01:19:52.689 --> 01:19:57.659
Bless Yen by two is the total
size of the population.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14796-0
01:19:57.669 --> 01:20:03.196
Yen is the total population and
by two is half of that minus the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14796-1
01:20:03.196 --> 01:20:08.724
frequency before the before this
interval divided by the size of

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14796-2
01:20:08.724 --> 01:20:09.829
the interval.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14800-0
01:20:11.069 --> 01:20:12.539
Divided by the.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14806-0
01:20:14.129 --> 01:20:17.489
Frequency of the median so.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14815-0
01:20:19.519 --> 01:20:22.819
Just one minute the the width.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14821-0
01:20:26.179 --> 01:20:28.309
So this multiple minus this.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14840-0
01:20:33.179 --> 01:20:38.979
So the frequency of the uh, let
me just capture this.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14846-0
01:20:39.029 --> 01:20:40.269
So this minus this?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14855-0
01:20:44.129 --> 01:20:46.779
L1 is 21.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14874-0
01:20:48.099 --> 01:20:57.389
L1 is 20 plus the north by two
minus the Sigma of the people.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14887-0
01:20:57.729 --> 01:21:04.559
So this is representing a the
the people.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14890-0
01:21:05.169 --> 01:21:07.369
Then you are looking at.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14910-0
01:21:09.689 --> 01:21:17.409
The width of the OK the width is
width is 2150 -.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14935-0
01:21:17.419 --> 01:21:22.194
21 OK, so the width is
representing the age, age and

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14935-1
01:21:22.194 --> 01:21:26.608
then this is the actual
frequency of that median

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14935-2
01:21:26.608 --> 01:21:27.419
interval.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14958-0
01:21:27.809 --> 01:21:31.925
So that is how you will have you
can find when you have only a

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14958-1
01:21:31.925 --> 01:21:35.519
histogram, you can try compute
doing the computations.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14999-0
01:21:35.569 --> 01:21:40.438
So I hope I'm sure you will be
able to do that and otherwise we

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14999-1
01:21:40.438 --> 01:21:45.155
can we can, we will be able to
do it either in a canvas or in

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/14999-2
01:21:45.155 --> 01:21:47.589
the class in the next class, OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15014-0
01:21:54.959 --> 01:21:59.709
OK, so so now we are talking
about more elements.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15024-0
01:21:59.939 --> 01:22:03.652
So before going there, we will
look at the probability

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15024-1
01:22:03.652 --> 01:22:04.529
distribution.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15037-0
01:22:04.759 --> 01:22:09.159
So so when we have a data when
we have random data.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15045-0
01:22:12.369 --> 01:22:15.319
So we have, uh, a random
variable.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15063-0
01:22:19.679 --> 01:22:23.928
Often we make an assumption that
it follows a probability density

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15063-1
01:22:23.928 --> 01:22:25.409
function as given here.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15078-0
01:22:27.169 --> 01:22:30.137
Which is called as a normal
distribution or a Gaussian

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15078-1
01:22:30.137 --> 01:22:30.839
distribution.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15099-0
01:22:31.329 --> 01:22:34.571
So what are the properties of
normal distribution or the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15099-1
01:22:34.571 --> 01:22:37.699
Gaussian distribution that is
going to look like this?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15111-0
01:22:37.869 --> 01:22:44.499
So this is a very smooth and
symmetric and distribution.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15118-0
01:22:44.809 --> 01:22:47.159
So which is representing that?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15127-0
01:22:47.689 --> 01:22:49.869
What is the meaning of the value
here?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15132-0
01:22:52.129 --> 01:22:53.729
Suppose this is X.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15164-0
01:22:55.649 --> 01:23:00.498
So this is going to represent
the probability density at this

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15164-1
01:23:00.498 --> 01:23:05.347
point of X and then the area of
the curve which is before the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15164-2
01:23:05.347 --> 01:23:06.989
green line says that.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15170-0
01:23:06.999 --> 01:23:07.729
What is the?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15173-0
01:23:08.219 --> 01:23:09.949
This is X1.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15195-0
01:23:10.199 --> 01:23:18.022
So what is the probability that
X is less than X1 is the area of

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15195-1
01:23:18.022 --> 01:23:20.549
curve of green shade?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15208-0
01:23:24.219 --> 01:23:27.801
And then the complete area of
the curve, complete area full

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15208-1
01:23:27.801 --> 01:23:28.099
area.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15212-0
01:23:31.169 --> 01:23:32.079
Under curve.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15224-0
01:23:32.249 --> 01:23:34.819
Can somebody guess what is the
full area under the curve?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15242-0
01:23:36.429 --> 01:23:37.589
One probably.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15243-0
01:23:36.979 --> 01:23:39.009
You did one one month.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15299-0
01:23:39.029 --> 01:23:41.637
Actually, according to the
employee to eat family, my dad

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15249-0
01:23:39.059 --> 01:23:39.609
It is one.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15265-0
01:23:39.619 --> 01:23:41.409
It is a probability density
function.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15297-0
01:23:41.619 --> 01:23:44.219
The sum of the density for all
possible values is 1.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15299-1
01:23:41.637 --> 01:23:44.470
has never gonna rule on how much
candy and employee because he

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15299-2
01:23:44.470 --> 01:23:45.909
mostly doesn't seem so straight.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15305-0
01:23:45.919 --> 01:23:46.559
And we really do.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15312-0
01:23:48.159 --> 01:23:49.409
Is somebody saying something?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15318-0
01:23:49.419 --> 01:23:50.249
Just let me come back.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15321-0
01:23:54.009 --> 01:23:54.859
OK, alright.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15349-0
01:23:57.599 --> 01:24:02.825
So this is what we often tend to
take and when we and the the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15349-1
01:24:02.825 --> 01:24:08.219
probability density function may
also be understood using these

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15349-2
01:24:08.219 --> 01:24:08.809
curves.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15359-0
01:24:09.139 --> 01:24:11.549
So this is from the source from
Wikipedia.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15375-0
01:24:11.839 --> 01:24:17.579
So when mean is 0 so we can see
that depending on the variance.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15400-0
01:24:18.319 --> 01:24:22.874
Ohh, so the blue is showing that
a small variance, so the that is

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15400-1
01:24:22.874 --> 01:24:24.669
how the cow look likes it.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15471-0
01:24:25.219 --> 01:24:29.366
It is going to have a
significant high density, high

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15471-1
01:24:29.366 --> 01:24:34.139
value at the mean and when you
increase the Sigma squared to

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15471-2
01:24:34.139 --> 01:24:38.911
one and five you can see that
the curve is getting flattened

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15471-3
01:24:38.911 --> 01:24:43.997
out and when you change the mean
mean MU then then what is going

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15471-4
01:24:43.997 --> 01:24:48.926
to happen when you change the
mean then the entire curve moves

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15471-5
01:24:48.926 --> 01:24:50.569
to the right or left.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15527-0
01:24:50.719 --> 01:24:54.075
If you make it minus MU is minus
the entire cover moves to the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15527-1
01:24:54.075 --> 01:24:57.165
left, and when you make it
positive it moves entire curve

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15527-2
01:24:57.165 --> 01:25:00.201
moves to the positive, so the
shape of the curve doesn't

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15508-0
01:24:59.219 --> 01:24:59.419
So.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15527-3
01:25:00.201 --> 01:25:03.610
change, but it simply translates
to the right or left depending

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15527-4
01:25:03.610 --> 01:25:04.729
on the change in May.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15537-0
01:25:05.049 --> 01:25:07.949
And then this is representing
the cumulative distribution

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15537-1
01:25:07.949 --> 01:25:08.399
function.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15574-0
01:25:08.529 --> 01:25:12.034
So that tells that when you are
talking about what is the we

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15574-1
01:25:12.034 --> 01:25:15.482
simply said that your compute
the area under the curve, but

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15574-2
01:25:15.482 --> 01:25:18.642
then the area under the curve
can be plotted using the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15574-3
01:25:18.642 --> 01:25:19.159
function.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15589-0
01:25:19.169 --> 01:25:21.588
Because this is a mathematical
expression, somebody can do

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15589-1
01:25:21.588 --> 01:25:22.449
integration and plot.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15603-0
01:25:22.789 --> 01:25:27.649
So this is what that plot looks
like and video often.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15607-0
01:25:27.919 --> 01:25:28.709
This is a.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15610-0
01:25:28.769 --> 01:25:30.059
This is a very good.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15616-0
01:25:31.289 --> 01:25:32.809
Symmetric distribution.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15648-0
01:25:33.079 --> 01:25:37.029
But very often we get end up
getting skewed distribution when

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15648-1
01:25:37.029 --> 01:25:40.724
we have a long tail on the
positive side, we call it as a

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15648-2
01:25:40.724 --> 01:25:42.699
positively skewed distribution.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15662-0
01:25:43.529 --> 01:25:47.151
We call this a positively skewed
distribution in a positively

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15662-1
01:25:47.151 --> 01:25:48.319
skewed distribution.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15696-0
01:25:48.369 --> 01:25:55.188
The the way will be that mean is
greater than median is greater

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15696-1
01:25:55.188 --> 01:26:01.794
than wood and the this is for
positively skewed and the exact

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15696-2
01:26:01.794 --> 01:26:05.629
opposite for the negatively
skewed.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15710-0
01:26:08.809 --> 01:26:14.322
Negatively skewed, so we know
that the mean is less than

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15710-1
01:26:14.322 --> 01:26:14.999
median.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15714-0
01:26:16.909 --> 01:26:18.029
Let's Dave mode.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15752-0
01:26:20.019 --> 01:26:24.339
So that tends to be the nature
of these cube distributions and

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15752-1
01:26:24.339 --> 01:26:27.972
but then for the skewed
distribution, we do not have

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15752-2
01:26:27.972 --> 01:26:31.949
such a simple mathematics like
the Gaussian distribution.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15761-0
01:26:31.959 --> 01:26:34.166
Mathematics are readily
available, but skewed

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15761-1
01:26:34.166 --> 01:26:34.789
distribution.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15774-0
01:26:35.039 --> 01:26:39.492
We may have to do our own
approximations and then need to

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15774-1
01:26:39.492 --> 01:26:40.029
fix it.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15827-0
01:26:44.119 --> 01:26:49.241
OK, so so the empirical relation
that is observed with the large

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15827-1
01:26:49.241 --> 01:26:53.890
volumes of data that have a
skewed relationship is this is

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15827-2
01:26:53.890 --> 01:26:58.933
not a, there is no mathematical
rigor to this, but then this is

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15827-3
01:26:58.933 --> 01:27:02.636
what is observed with large
volumes and skewed

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15827-4
01:27:02.636 --> 01:27:03.739
distributions.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15848-0
01:27:10.179 --> 01:27:17.593
And and now let us come to the
formula for standard deviation

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15848-1
01:27:17.593 --> 01:27:21.779
and the standard deviation is
the.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15879-0
01:27:23.899 --> 01:27:28.019
So so now you can say the
standard deviation is Sigma or

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15879-1
01:27:28.019 --> 01:27:31.199
yes and the variance is the
square of that.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15893-0
01:27:31.729 --> 01:27:34.699
And this is the formula when it
is a sample.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15911-0
01:27:35.229 --> 01:27:42.307
When it is a sample, you compute
using uh you using, you use the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15911-1
01:27:42.307 --> 01:27:43.069
symbol.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15927-0
01:27:43.079 --> 01:27:47.215
Yes, some authors use the symbol
yes for sample and symbol Sigma

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15927-1
01:27:47.215 --> 01:27:48.169
for population.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15952-0
01:27:49.059 --> 01:27:55.083
So when it is when it is a
sample, you use yen minus one in

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15952-1
01:27:55.083 --> 01:27:56.689
the denominator.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15962-0
01:27:57.199 --> 01:28:01.259
When it is population you use
capital in full population.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15974-0
01:28:02.239 --> 01:28:06.219
Uh, so does somebody want to
explain why that is happening?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/15991-0
01:28:15.829 --> 01:28:20.589
Sample is a very limited set of
data, whereas population can be.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16003-0
01:28:23.949 --> 01:28:27.089
But tends to a very large
number.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16022-0
01:28:28.519 --> 01:28:31.671
But then why for the sample
instead of using the sample

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16022-1
01:28:31.671 --> 01:28:33.979
size, you use the sample size
minus one?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16045-0
01:28:40.889 --> 01:28:44.909
It's like the series of all
Nature series of natural numbers

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16045-1
01:28:44.909 --> 01:28:46.029
N into n -, 1 by.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16049-0
01:28:47.369 --> 01:28:48.499
No, no, no, no.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16057-0
01:28:48.509 --> 01:28:50.039
I no, I think no.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16091-0
01:28:50.049 --> 01:28:54.566
It may be missed the point that
I'm just checking if anyone of

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16075-0
01:28:53.859 --> 01:28:54.049
Like.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16091-1
01:28:54.566 --> 01:28:58.939
you can give a some some answer
which stays with the sample.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16114-0
01:28:56.839 --> 01:29:02.729
Lately sample sample list sample
list.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16119-0
01:28:58.949 --> 01:29:03.582
We you have a small sample of 10
then you still want to say the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16119-1
01:29:03.582 --> 01:29:05.899
denominator is 9 rather than 10.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16136-0
01:29:10.719 --> 01:29:13.579
Sample is always less than the
actual data.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16139-0
01:29:13.599 --> 01:29:14.769
Absolutely, absolutely.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16154-0
01:29:14.779 --> 01:29:19.315
Mr KAVIN, I think sample range
will be always smaller than the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16154-1
01:29:19.315 --> 01:29:20.539
population range.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16156-0
01:29:21.649 --> 01:29:22.319
So.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16182-0
01:29:22.389 --> 01:29:26.764
So what we are doing is that by
reducing the denominator we are

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16182-1
01:29:26.764 --> 01:29:30.729
trying to capture the variance
in the population from the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16182-2
01:29:30.729 --> 01:29:31.549
sample data.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16231-0
01:29:34.129 --> 01:29:38.085
By reducing because the sample
range is small, but so to get a

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16231-1
01:29:38.085 --> 01:29:41.664
better estimation of the
population variance or standard

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16231-2
01:29:41.664 --> 01:29:45.556
deviation, So what we do is that
when we do a sample, we know

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16231-3
01:29:45.556 --> 01:29:48.319
that we are not capturing the
entire range.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16256-0
01:29:48.669 --> 01:29:53.593
So what we do is that we reduce
the denominator so that that

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16256-1
01:29:53.593 --> 01:29:56.579
will give a better indication of
it.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16264-0
01:29:56.589 --> 01:29:59.759
It becomes a representation of
the population value.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16276-0
01:30:00.069 --> 01:30:03.039
So suppose that let me drop
pictorially.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16280-0
01:30:03.049 --> 01:30:04.699
So maybe you will understand.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16296-0
01:30:05.049 --> 01:30:07.922
So suppose that there is a data
in one dimensions one

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16296-1
01:30:07.922 --> 01:30:08.879
dimensional space.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16306-0
01:30:08.889 --> 01:30:10.899
So the data range is from here
to here.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16324-0
01:30:11.519 --> 01:30:14.353
Suppose that you have taken some
random samples, random samples

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16324-1
01:30:14.353 --> 01:30:15.859
on taking with a different
color.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16334-0
01:30:16.269 --> 01:30:18.449
OK, so the random samples are
here.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16338-0
01:30:18.459 --> 01:30:20.139
Here, here, here.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16349-0
01:30:20.709 --> 01:30:24.139
Now you know that using the
random samples.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16379-0
01:30:24.149 --> 01:30:28.213
So if you use the population
formula you are going to

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16379-1
01:30:28.213 --> 01:30:33.029
represent the variance with this
range, but you want to capture

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16379-2
01:30:33.029 --> 01:30:35.889
the variance with the for this
range.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16390-0
01:30:36.159 --> 01:30:39.407
So you are reducing the
denominator so that it becomes a

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16390-1
01:30:39.407 --> 01:30:40.319
better estimate.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16406-0
01:30:43.239 --> 01:30:46.780
Are you saying the reducing the
denominator for adjusting for

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16406-1
01:30:46.780 --> 01:30:47.979
possible sample bias?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16436-0
01:30:49.469 --> 01:30:52.343
No, no, there is nothing like
bias any the bias is even if the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16436-1
01:30:52.343 --> 01:30:54.579
bias is not there, still the
range will be less.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16441-0
01:30:54.589 --> 01:30:55.259
Is that correct?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16490-0
01:30:55.849 --> 01:30:59.164
In fact, if the range is same
for the sample and population

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16471-0
01:30:58.029 --> 01:30:59.059
Yes, it's just saying.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16490-1
01:30:59.164 --> 01:31:02.535
when the sample size is much
smaller than, it means that the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16483-0
01:30:59.219 --> 01:31:00.949
So give it a straight.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16490-2
01:31:02.535 --> 01:31:03.529
sample has a bias.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16522-0
01:31:04.559 --> 01:31:07.445
If you say that you are getting
a full range with the sample,

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16522-1
01:31:07.445 --> 01:31:10.238
possibly the sample has some
bias because you you are extra

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16522-2
01:31:10.238 --> 01:31:12.239
careful and you are taking the
edge cases.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16538-0
01:31:13.219 --> 01:31:17.434
But if you take a random sample,
it should not capture the full

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16538-1
01:31:17.434 --> 01:31:17.829
range.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16545-0
01:31:18.099 --> 01:31:19.139
Is that right, Mr Rajesh?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16558-0
01:31:20.279 --> 01:31:22.129
The random sample will not
capture the full range.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16555-0
01:31:20.509 --> 01:31:20.719
Yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16561-0
01:31:23.179 --> 01:31:23.749
But why?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16571-0
01:31:23.759 --> 01:31:26.829
Once her why we are reducing by
only one?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16583-0
01:31:27.179 --> 01:31:28.359
What is the logic behind that?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16579-0
01:31:27.809 --> 01:31:28.319
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16584-0
01:31:28.329 --> 01:31:29.119
OK, OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16586-0
01:31:29.129 --> 01:31:29.659
So.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16590-0
01:31:29.729 --> 01:31:30.799
So no, there is.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16620-0
01:31:30.849 --> 01:31:34.883
See you are trying to make an
estimate, so you can always say

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16620-1
01:31:34.883 --> 01:31:36.639
that too, but then you can.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16633-0
01:31:36.589 --> 01:31:37.989
I think it is working now.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16669-0
01:31:36.709 --> 01:31:40.296
But two is not proper because
what we are saying is that

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16650-0
01:31:40.269 --> 01:31:42.039
He has never made fun.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16669-1
01:31:40.296 --> 01:31:43.569
suppose that there is a range
that is a range from.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16676-0
01:31:42.129 --> 01:31:45.766
That you should be able to
download data then only you can

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16676-1
01:31:45.766 --> 01:31:46.259
ohk. OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16674-0
01:31:45.779 --> 01:31:46.069
Huh.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16685-0
01:31:46.299 --> 01:31:47.669
OK, deceiving name with.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16686-0
01:31:47.019 --> 01:31:49.039
Mr Ananth Narayan, you want to
say something?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16690-0
01:31:51.849 --> 01:31:52.349
Sorry, sorry.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16699-0
01:31:54.479 --> 01:31:55.789
That was, I should be
understood.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16704-0
01:31:56.919 --> 01:31:58.849
OK, why n -?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16722-0
01:31:58.859 --> 01:32:01.806
One you think about it, that is
the best possible change that

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16722-1
01:32:01.806 --> 01:32:02.329
you can do.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16741-0
01:32:02.629 --> 01:32:07.286
For example, suppose that you
got a data which is in the range

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16741-1
01:32:07.286 --> 01:32:08.469
of zero to 1000.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16749-0
01:32:08.799 --> 01:32:10.469
That is, the entire population
range.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16791-0
01:32:10.839 --> 01:32:16.374
So when you take a population,
when you try to get the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16791-1
01:32:16.374 --> 01:32:22.915
population which is only 10% of
that, then you need to recognize

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16791-2
01:32:22.915 --> 01:32:28.349
that the the what you miss is
likely to be about 10%.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16806-0
01:32:28.719 --> 01:32:33.569
So instead of using hundred, you
want to use 99.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16820-0
01:32:33.699 --> 01:32:38.267
So when you multiply, it becomes
990, so that is what you will

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16820-1
01:32:38.267 --> 01:32:38.629
miss.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16839-0
01:32:38.639 --> 01:32:41.186
So you think about it, there is
nothing like I can give you an

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16839-1
01:32:41.186 --> 01:32:41.469
answer.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16872-0
01:32:41.899 --> 01:32:45.630
So that is how all the
statistics books, right and most

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16872-1
01:32:45.630 --> 01:32:49.894
of the statistics books will not
explain to you because that is

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16872-2
01:32:49.894 --> 01:32:51.559
pretty much an intuition.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16904-0
01:32:52.849 --> 01:32:57.033
Who said that small N that you
are showing there it is the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16904-1
01:32:57.033 --> 01:32:59.869
sample size, not the whole size,
right?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16898-0
01:32:58.759 --> 01:32:59.789
8 sample size.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16902-0
01:32:59.799 --> 01:33:00.389
That is correct.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16905-0
01:33:00.519 --> 01:33:00.979
That is correct.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16938-0
01:33:03.129 --> 01:33:06.829
So out of 1000, if you're taking
ten as sample, then we will

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16938-1
01:33:06.829 --> 01:33:07.739
divide it by 9.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16936-0
01:33:06.929 --> 01:33:07.539
No, no, no.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16948-0
01:33:07.649 --> 01:33:09.139
No, no, no, no, no, just one
minute.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16951-0
01:33:07.749 --> 01:33:08.409
Is what we are saying.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16963-0
01:33:09.209 --> 01:33:12.839
You have taken 10% of the
sample, 10% as the sample.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/16972-0
01:33:13.269 --> 01:33:15.499
So then, what do you what you
are doing?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17006-0
01:33:15.509 --> 01:33:20.697
Is that suppose that you are you
are taking hundred but you are

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17006-1
01:33:20.697 --> 01:33:24.669
taking 10% of the sample will
become hundred OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17051-0
01:33:24.759 --> 01:33:30.336
So instead of using 100, So what
you are doing is that you are

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17008-0
01:33:25.139 --> 01:33:25.359
Mm-hmm.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17051-1
01:33:30.336 --> 01:33:35.913
reducing it to 99 because what
you think is that when you take

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17051-2
01:33:35.913 --> 01:33:40.959
a sample of size 10%, the range
will also reduce by 10%.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17080-0
01:33:41.389 --> 01:33:46.761
If you take a sample of 100%,
the range will be 100%, but then

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17080-1
01:33:46.761 --> 01:33:49.489
you take a sample of size 9010%.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17087-0
01:33:50.019 --> 01:33:52.589
If you take a temple, sorry.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17091-0
01:33:52.599 --> 01:33:53.309
Just one minute.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17098-0
01:33:53.999 --> 01:33:56.499
When you take a sample which is
1 by.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17110-0
01:33:58.219 --> 01:34:02.879
Sample size is 10%, so 1 by 10.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17137-0
01:34:04.519 --> 01:34:09.223
So it is there is a good
likelihood that you will miss

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17137-1
01:34:09.223 --> 01:34:13.329
that much in the range and you
will compensate.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17134-0
01:34:10.849 --> 01:34:11.069
So.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17166-0
01:34:13.769 --> 01:34:18.249
So just let let us see 1000 from
990.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17164-0
01:34:15.899 --> 01:34:17.859
So so basically it's the IT is.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17177-0
01:34:17.869 --> 01:34:20.639
Yes, there is a simple.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17178-0
01:34:18.259 --> 01:34:20.939
So you are taking 99%, so
alright.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17182-0
01:34:21.799 --> 01:34:22.769
Yeah, OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17211-0
01:34:23.359 --> 01:34:28.894
Because what you do is that you
will adjust the the range 100,

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17211-1
01:34:28.894 --> 01:34:33.199
so you will miss about one by
hundredth of that.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17216-0
01:34:34.039 --> 01:34:37.549
So you will miss about so 10%
you take.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17255-0
01:34:37.559 --> 01:34:41.746
So suppose that you have taken
100, so forget about 10% you

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17255-1
01:34:41.746 --> 01:34:46.002
take 100 out of 1000, so you are
likely to miss the range by

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17255-2
01:34:46.002 --> 01:34:47.049
about 1 by 100.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17261-0
01:34:47.059 --> 01:34:48.169
So that is the estimation.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17293-0
01:34:48.439 --> 01:34:53.355
So based on that you will see
that you have to use 99 as the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17293-1
01:34:53.355 --> 01:34:58.513
fraction so that will compensate
for what you missed as that 1%

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17293-2
01:34:58.513 --> 01:34:59.319
missed no.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17295-0
01:34:59.369 --> 01:35:00.019
So.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17316-0
01:35:00.079 --> 01:35:04.806
So because what we are saying is
that we are missing the, we are

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17316-1
01:35:04.806 --> 01:35:06.479
taking 100 as a sample.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17332-0
01:35:06.489 --> 01:35:10.059
So what we miss will be about 1
by 100 of the range.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17350-0
01:35:10.489 --> 01:35:14.443
So we are removing that one by
hundred from the denominator so

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17350-1
01:35:14.443 --> 01:35:16.639
that we will get the proper
value.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17358-0
01:35:16.789 --> 01:35:18.239
So this is the intuition.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17362-0
01:35:18.249 --> 01:35:18.739
So.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17366-0
01:35:18.779 --> 01:35:21.129
So just go with that and.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17377-0
01:35:24.949 --> 01:35:25.169
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17379-0
01:35:25.169 --> 01:35:26.179
A misunder ya.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17384-0
01:35:26.189 --> 01:35:27.959
Is your your explaining
something?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17396-0
01:35:27.969 --> 01:35:30.600
Standard deviation represents
the average distribution, not

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17396-1
01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:31.609
the whole distribution.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17404-0
01:35:33.099 --> 01:35:34.449
I do not know is that.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17407-0
01:35:36.659 --> 01:35:36.959
Key.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17415-0
01:35:48.809 --> 01:35:49.639
No, right.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17420-0
01:35:49.649 --> 01:35:50.599
So we don't be.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17432-0
01:35:50.649 --> 01:35:53.879
So this is the formula so I hope
we are there.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17448-0
01:35:54.149 --> 01:35:57.940
Then we will look at skewness
and kurtosis in order to

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17448-1
01:35:57.940 --> 01:35:59.939
understand the distributions.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17461-0
01:36:00.209 --> 01:36:03.979
So skewness and kurtosis is the
they are given by the formula.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17479-0
01:36:04.109 --> 01:36:07.267
So you can see that there is a
formula for skew and there is a

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17479-1
01:36:07.267 --> 01:36:08.319
formula for kurtosis.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17505-0
01:36:08.679 --> 01:36:12.154
So what we are saying is that
when these are have the values,

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17505-1
01:36:12.154 --> 01:36:15.349
so the books will give you what
is the acceptable range.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17512-0
01:36:15.359 --> 01:36:16.459
What is not acceptable?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17563-0
01:36:16.829 --> 01:36:20.876
So if we take the data and then
suppose that we are having the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17563-1
01:36:20.876 --> 01:36:25.116
data which is represented by the
histogram like this, you can see

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17563-2
01:36:25.116 --> 01:36:29.227
that the difference between the
histogram on this sheet one and

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17563-3
01:36:29.227 --> 01:36:33.339
histogram on sheet three you can
see that the skew and kurtosis

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17563-4
01:36:33.339 --> 01:36:34.559
have changed right?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17591-0
01:36:36.139 --> 01:36:40.022
So so now that can give you a
indication that the they are

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17591-1
01:36:40.022 --> 01:36:44.169
indications that how close you
are to the normal distribution.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17620-0
01:36:45.419 --> 01:36:49.029
So the skew we generally
computed using this formula you

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17620-1
01:36:49.029 --> 01:36:52.766
are writing to the power of
three, so you may get positive

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17620-2
01:36:52.766 --> 01:36:53.969
or negative values.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17639-0
01:36:54.299 --> 01:36:56.437
Positive values will be
representing skew in One

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17639-1
01:36:56.437 --> 01:36:58.749
Direction and negative value in
the other direction.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17670-0
01:36:59.159 --> 01:37:01.870
Because when you raise it to the
power of three, you say that you

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17670-1
01:37:01.870 --> 01:37:04.294
retain the sign when it is
raised to the power of two, you

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17670-2
01:37:04.294 --> 01:37:04.869
lose the sign.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17701-0
01:37:05.359 --> 01:37:08.914
So the point is, negative skew
indicates that the data is

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17701-1
01:37:08.914 --> 01:37:12.958
skewed to the left and long left
tail and positive skew indicates

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17701-2
01:37:12.958 --> 01:37:14.429
that long positive tail.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17730-0
01:37:15.179 --> 01:37:19.733
And then when kurtosis is
representing that nature of the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17730-1
01:37:19.733 --> 01:37:24.837
so for example, you are looking
at the Gaussian distribution and

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17730-2
01:37:24.837 --> 01:37:27.349
a high kurtosis is representing.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17752-0
01:37:27.359 --> 01:37:31.143
As you can see here, the high
kurtosis is represented by this

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17752-1
01:37:31.143 --> 01:37:34.621
example and the negative
cortosis is represented by this

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17752-2
01:37:34.621 --> 01:37:35.109
example.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17763-0
01:37:35.769 --> 01:37:38.929
So the kurtosis is something
which is telling that.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17801-0
01:37:38.939 --> 01:37:43.573
How is it the data is differing
from a normal distribution so so

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17801-1
01:37:43.573 --> 01:37:47.281
this is giving you any
indication so you are better

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17801-2
01:37:47.281 --> 01:37:51.915
prepared that how much error the
normal distribution may give to

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17801-3
01:37:51.915 --> 01:37:52.129
me.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17839-0
01:37:52.279 --> 01:37:55.931
So this is not really saving you
saying that you have to invent a

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17839-1
01:37:55.931 --> 01:37:59.527
new formula, but it can give you
and then if it is significantly

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17839-2
01:37:59.527 --> 01:38:02.515
different then you start
exploring the other possible

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17839-3
01:38:02.515 --> 01:38:03.179
mathematics.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17854-0
01:38:09.169 --> 01:38:13.745
And then we have for the
discrete sample data we consider

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17854-1
01:38:13.745 --> 01:38:14.849
the quartiles.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17862-0
01:38:16.799 --> 01:38:19.369
We consider the quartiles so
quartile.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17868-0
01:38:19.379 --> 01:38:20.829
Is it 25th percentile?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17884-0
01:38:20.999 --> 01:38:25.889
So we consider Q12Q1Q2Q3.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17894-0
01:38:26.079 --> 01:38:28.389
So Q4 is representing the end of
the data.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17916-0
01:38:28.479 --> 01:38:32.388
So we put the data in a sorted
sequence and we find out what is

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17916-1
01:38:32.388 --> 01:38:33.609
the 25th percentile.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17922-0
01:38:33.739 --> 01:38:35.229
What is the 50th percentile?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17947-0
01:38:35.359 --> 01:38:40.187
This is same as median 50th
percentile is same as median and

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17947-1
01:38:40.187 --> 01:38:43.749
then you have you also find 75th
percentile.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17967-0
01:38:44.019 --> 01:38:47.972
So these are considered as
interesting quartiles by when

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17967-1
01:38:47.972 --> 01:38:50.469
people analyze the data many
times.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17978-0
01:38:50.779 --> 01:38:55.129
So interquartile range is Q3
minus Q1.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17989-0
01:38:55.179 --> 01:38:57.629
What is the value at 75th
percentile and minus?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/17999-0
01:38:57.639 --> 01:38:59.389
What is the value at 25th
percentile?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18012-0
01:38:59.939 --> 01:39:05.344
So many people like to describe
their data using 5 number

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18012-1
01:39:05.344 --> 01:39:06.089
summary.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18027-0
01:39:06.099 --> 01:39:09.482
This is one of the popular ways
in which people describe the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18027-1
01:39:09.482 --> 01:39:09.759
data.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18038-0
01:39:10.529 --> 01:39:13.369
So suppose that you have got a
data like this.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18056-0
01:39:13.569 --> 01:39:16.792
So which is which is which you
mean get it in a random

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18056-1
01:39:16.792 --> 01:39:17.319
sequence.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18069-0
01:39:17.329 --> 01:39:20.299
First you need to sort it into a
increase ascending sequence.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18082-0
01:39:20.909 --> 01:39:24.999
Then you start computing, so you
need to count.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18087-0
01:39:25.009 --> 01:39:26.429
There are five numbers here.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18109-0
01:39:27.659 --> 01:39:35.549
Uh for 10152022, so I think
about 32 values, right?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18124-0
01:39:36.519 --> 01:39:40.238
I'm assuming that so now you
need to compute accordingly the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18124-1
01:39:40.238 --> 01:39:40.969
quartile is.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18151-0
01:39:41.039 --> 01:39:45.340
This is 20th percentile, so 20th
percentile we are taking I think

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18151-1
01:39:45.340 --> 01:39:46.969
24 numbers or 22 numbers.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18168-0
01:39:46.979 --> 01:39:50.888
So 20 is coming as the first
quartile, the median is coming

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18168-1
01:39:50.888 --> 01:39:51.409
as 25th.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18218-0
01:39:51.419 --> 01:39:55.523
One of these then the queue
three 7550% is coming is like

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18218-1
01:39:55.523 --> 01:40:00.193
this and then maximum is this so
that is one of the ways in which

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18218-2
01:40:00.193 --> 01:40:04.650
we are going to capture and this
we have already discussed the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18218-3
01:40:04.650 --> 01:40:06.419
Esquire and Sigma Square.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18239-0
01:40:06.849 --> 01:40:12.676
So generally what is considered
is that we make a box plot of

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18239-1
01:40:12.676 --> 01:40:14.649
the data and boxplot.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18250-0
01:40:14.659 --> 01:40:16.549
I think we have visualized in
the next slide.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18270-0
01:40:16.879 --> 01:40:21.778
So give any data we take the
lower extreme which is min

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18270-1
01:40:21.778 --> 01:40:25.189
minimal, right, upper extreme
maximum.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18273-0
01:40:25.339 --> 01:40:27.239
Then this is 25th percentile.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18287-0
01:40:29.149 --> 01:40:33.389
Our Q1 and then this is the 75th
percentile.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18306-0
01:40:35.719 --> 01:40:40.549
Our Q3 and then this is the and
then median is 15th percentile.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18399-0
01:40:40.599 --> 01:40:44.813
So generally this is represented
by the box because that box is

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18399-1
01:40:44.813 --> 01:40:48.368
supposed to capture the the
significant range for the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18399-2
01:40:48.368 --> 01:40:52.187
variable for which we are
getting the values because 25th

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18399-3
01:40:52.187 --> 01:40:56.466
to 5070 fifth percentile should
give you an indication that that

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18399-4
01:40:56.466 --> 01:41:00.548
is the most likely answer that
you get when you try with some

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18399-5
01:41:00.548 --> 01:41:04.696
random thing for which you do
not know the major, it is likely

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18399-6
01:41:04.696 --> 01:41:08.251
to fall in this range so that
but it we just give the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18399-7
01:41:08.251 --> 01:41:10.819
importance by drawing a box
around it.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18431-0
01:41:11.889 --> 01:41:17.511
And what we also do is that we
start we we use the whiskers to

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18431-1
01:41:17.511 --> 01:41:22.419
lines outside the box extended
to minimum and maximum.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18453-0
01:41:27.269 --> 01:41:35.445
So what we generally do is that
the outliers are computed based

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18453-1
01:41:35.445 --> 01:41:36.339
on IQR.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18491-0
01:41:37.079 --> 01:41:45.785
So what we do is that we say Q 1
-, 1.5 * I QR is unlikely to be

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18491-1
01:41:45.785 --> 01:41:51.679
a data that is generated by
normal process.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18502-0
01:41:52.009 --> 01:41:54.709
So it is with this we can treat
as an outlier.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18533-0
01:41:55.089 --> 01:42:00.729
Similarly, when we see something
like Q 3 + 1.5 times IQR, we

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18533-1
01:42:00.729 --> 01:42:06.459
think that that is unlikely to
be generated by normal process.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18550-0
01:42:06.469 --> 01:42:09.619
It is an outlet, so now let us
look at the example for this.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18565-0
01:42:09.629 --> 01:42:13.099
We have computed the min, Max,
Q1Q3, median.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18567-0
01:42:13.469 --> 01:42:15.819
So now the IQR.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18573-0
01:42:15.829 --> 01:42:16.689
What is the IQR?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18579-0
01:42:18.589 --> 01:42:19.409
What is the QR?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18586-0
01:42:21.029 --> 01:42:21.669
15 right.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18599-0
01:42:22.919 --> 01:42:24.629
Is that clear or somebody's
uncomfortable?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18613-0
01:42:23.179 --> 01:42:23.449
In.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18604-0
01:42:25.269 --> 01:42:26.389
Q3 minus Q1.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18603-0
01:42:25.789 --> 01:42:26.039
We can.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18609-0
01:42:27.439 --> 01:42:29.109
Yeah, somebody's comfortable,
right?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18611-0
01:42:29.119 --> 01:42:29.959
Everybody's comfortable.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18616-0
01:42:32.069 --> 01:42:32.249
Yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18617-0
01:42:33.219 --> 01:42:33.579
Yes, Sir.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18630-0
01:42:40.069 --> 01:42:43.129
Alright, so now let us compute
1.5.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18636-0
01:42:45.029 --> 01:42:46.099
Times I QR.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18649-0
01:42:48.379 --> 01:42:50.959
This is equal to 22.5.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18657-0
01:42:51.339 --> 01:42:53.229
So now let us look at Q3.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18669-0
01:42:53.819 --> 01:42:56.849
It is 35 and Q1 it is 20.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18694-0
01:42:56.979 --> 01:43:01.918
So if it is 20 -, 22.5 it is
something less than this,

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18694-1
01:43:01.918 --> 01:43:05.869
something less than this is less
than this.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18704-0
01:43:05.879 --> 01:43:07.419
Then we think that it is an
outlier.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18729-0
01:43:07.759 --> 01:43:14.468
Similarly, X is greater than 35
+ 22.5 then also we suspect that

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18729-1
01:43:14.468 --> 01:43:16.429
it is an all clear.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18741-0
01:43:16.659 --> 01:43:20.169
So now when we seeing this 70 is
looking like you know, OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18762-0
01:43:22.489 --> 01:43:24.539
Does it look like an outlier
when you look at the data?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18765-0
01:43:25.339 --> 01:43:26.039
Think it's all?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18774-0
01:43:26.089 --> 01:43:28.139
I'm just trying to understand.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18769-0
01:43:27.399 --> 01:43:27.529
This.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18805-0
01:43:29.469 --> 01:43:32.898
Will you please explain me once
once again IQR I'm able to

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18805-1
01:43:32.898 --> 01:43:35.629
understand what 1.5 from where
we are getting.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18801-0
01:43:35.939 --> 01:43:36.209
No.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18808-0
01:43:36.219 --> 01:43:37.419
We are getting from nowhere.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18838-0
01:43:37.429 --> 01:43:41.776
That is a general agreement
among all the people saying that

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18838-1
01:43:41.776 --> 01:43:45.339
more than 1.5 IQR, I will treat
it as an outlier.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18847-0
01:43:46.209 --> 01:43:47.849
OK, not.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18850-0
01:43:47.479 --> 01:43:49.209
This is nothing so.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18867-0
01:43:49.259 --> 01:43:53.540
So, OK, one thing you may say
that OK, has it come out as a

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18867-1
01:43:53.540 --> 01:43:54.039
vacuum?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18869-0
01:43:54.379 --> 01:43:54.929
What?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18896-0
01:43:54.979 --> 01:43:58.736
What is generally considered is
that when Barry, the normal

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18896-1
01:43:58.736 --> 01:44:02.369
distribution people, have a
tendency to believe that when

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18896-2
01:44:02.369 --> 01:44:02.619
new.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18916-0
01:44:03.469 --> 01:44:10.049
Minus 3 Sigma or MU plus three
Sigma, or likely to be outliers.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18926-0
01:44:10.609 --> 01:44:12.349
So that is what many people
consider.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18955-0
01:44:13.229 --> 01:44:18.470
And if the data same data that
you got for use it for box plot

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/18955-1
01:44:18.470 --> 01:44:22.379
you try to push it into a normal
distribution.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19001-0
01:44:22.749 --> 01:44:26.805
The approximate value you get
for the 1.5 IQR should be this

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19001-1
01:44:26.805 --> 01:44:30.927
if assuming that the data is
strictly formal following normal

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19001-2
01:44:30.927 --> 01:44:34.917
distribution, but then you we
that is not an exact equation

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19001-3
01:44:34.917 --> 01:44:36.579
that is an approximation.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19006-0
01:44:36.829 --> 01:44:37.579
So.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19053-0
01:44:37.639 --> 01:44:42.028
So, since there is a 3 Sigma or
Six Sigma as the valid range for

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19053-1
01:44:42.028 --> 01:44:46.215
normal distributions, so why not
use 1.5 IQR which is nearest

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19053-2
01:44:46.215 --> 01:44:50.401
value that you can get as the as
the filtering mechanism with

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19053-3
01:44:50.401 --> 01:44:51.009
boxplots?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19055-0
01:44:51.339 --> 01:44:51.799
Is that clear?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19065-0
01:44:54.509 --> 01:44:55.239
There is no.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19075-0
01:44:55.159 --> 01:44:55.349
If.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19082-0
01:44:55.309 --> 01:44:57.581
There is no rigorous
mathematics, but it is an

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19082-1
01:44:57.581 --> 01:44:59.369
approximation to plus minus 3
Sigma.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19109-0
01:45:02.669 --> 01:45:05.909
Does this apply only to normal
distribution or also to gamma

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19099-0
01:45:05.869 --> 01:45:06.539
No, no.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19109-1
01:45:05.909 --> 01:45:06.599
distribution?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19103-0
01:45:06.589 --> 01:45:06.959
See.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19123-0
01:45:06.969 --> 01:45:09.595
See, the point is that when you
have many other distributions,

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19123-1
01:45:09.595 --> 01:45:11.429
obviously you cannot get them
right, right?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19146-0
01:45:11.809 --> 01:45:16.337
So the the I I'm just trying to
answer that 1.5 comes close to

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19130-0
01:45:11.979 --> 01:45:12.179
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19146-1
01:45:16.337 --> 01:45:17.199
three Sigma.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19181-0
01:45:17.279 --> 01:45:20.609
If it is normal distribution,
but then nobody will tell you

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19163-0
01:45:19.029 --> 01:45:19.269
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19181-1
01:45:20.609 --> 01:45:23.995
that it is 1.5 is they have
taken because they want to match

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19181-2
01:45:23.995 --> 01:45:24.439
3 Sigma.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19186-0
01:45:24.449 --> 01:45:25.809
They simply say that take one
point.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19259-0
01:45:28.079 --> 01:45:31.939
Of course, if you if your data
or your own business, or if your

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19198-0
01:45:28.149 --> 01:45:28.309
So.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19259-1
01:45:31.939 --> 01:45:35.859
own sense of the data says that
you need to use different levels

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19259-2
01:45:35.859 --> 01:45:39.599
for like your, you can use it
because you think that for your

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19259-3
01:45:39.599 --> 01:45:43.097
business you are selling some
product and you have a wide

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19259-4
01:45:43.097 --> 01:45:45.509
range of characteristics of the
people.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19264-0
01:45:45.839 --> 01:45:46.759
So you are free.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19272-0
01:45:46.769 --> 01:45:48.009
I mean, there is nothing.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19276-0
01:45:48.049 --> 01:45:49.619
Nobody's imposing this.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19284-0
01:45:49.719 --> 01:45:52.929
But then outlier itself is an
interesting concept.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19315-0
01:45:53.259 --> 01:45:58.199
So what is an outlier is really
something which which is always

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19315-1
01:45:58.199 --> 01:46:02.599
a always a something like we
don't have an exact answer.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19318-0
01:46:02.609 --> 01:46:03.199
What is it now?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19324-0
01:46:03.209 --> 01:46:03.479
Clear.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19342-0
01:46:03.789 --> 01:46:07.047
But then outliers are something
that all the businesses are weak

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19342-1
01:46:07.047 --> 01:46:07.849
in on capturing.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19354-0
01:46:08.289 --> 01:46:12.879
So for example, I tell I think I
had.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19375-0
01:46:13.389 --> 01:46:17.161
So suppose that you are working
for a bank and you are

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19375-1
01:46:17.161 --> 01:46:19.699
interested in getting the
customers.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19396-0
01:46:20.109 --> 01:46:23.554
So you set up an office in,
let's say, in one of the IT

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19396-1
01:46:23.554 --> 01:46:25.399
district of one of the cities.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19432-0
01:46:25.829 --> 01:46:29.810
So you will get many people who
have got a income in the range

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19432-1
01:46:29.810 --> 01:46:33.474
of, let us say 1 range, some
range X2Y and now add to the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19432-2
01:46:33.474 --> 01:46:34.169
same place.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19465-0
01:46:34.179 --> 01:46:37.563
Suppose that Mister Gautam Adani
walks in and says that I want to

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19465-1
01:46:37.563 --> 01:46:40.844
open the account in the bank, so
the bank should make a special

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19465-2
01:46:40.844 --> 01:46:41.869
note of that person.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19478-0
01:46:41.879 --> 01:46:44.409
Is it not so now if you ask me
why and what?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19485-0
01:46:45.669 --> 01:46:47.059
But then you assume right?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19501-0
01:46:47.109 --> 01:46:50.584
So that is what we that is, that
should be important for the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19501-1
01:46:50.584 --> 01:46:50.869
bank.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19516-0
01:46:51.739 --> 01:46:55.074
So that obviously because that
person is not matching any of

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19516-1
01:46:55.074 --> 01:46:55.839
these numbers.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19523-0
01:46:57.579 --> 01:46:57.979
Makes sense?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19533-0
01:46:58.919 --> 01:47:01.929
So Venkat, suggest one
confirmation.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19527-0
01:46:59.289 --> 01:46:59.549
Right.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19541-0
01:47:01.939 --> 01:47:06.679
So here in the calculation that
is there, yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19543-0
01:47:07.599 --> 01:47:07.749
Yes.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19551-0
01:47:09.189 --> 01:47:10.789
I will you please say yes.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19568-0
01:47:10.839 --> 01:47:15.489
So 1.5 multiplied by IQR is
nothing but third quartile.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19579-0
01:47:15.499 --> 01:47:18.359
You're referring to, which is
nothing but X +, -, 3 Sigma.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19587-0
01:47:20.329 --> 01:47:20.979
No, no, no, no.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19603-0
01:47:20.989 --> 01:47:24.334
Don't go into X + -, 3 Sigma,
because we are not capturing the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19603-1
01:47:24.334 --> 01:47:24.599
mean.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19612-0
01:47:24.609 --> 01:47:27.019
Here we are capturing the median
so.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19623-0
01:47:27.109 --> 01:47:29.779
So what I told you is that don't
go.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19632-0
01:47:29.789 --> 01:47:30.639
Don't rush into that.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19638-0
01:47:29.979 --> 01:47:32.689
But mean but but mean median.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19634-0
01:47:31.809 --> 01:47:32.339
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19646-0
01:47:32.349 --> 01:47:34.319
OK, Mr Mr.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19653-0
01:47:33.139 --> 01:47:34.299
Please allow me to speak.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19648-0
01:47:34.359 --> 01:47:35.139
Mr Saurav.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19675-0
01:47:35.149 --> 01:47:38.831
Mr Saurav, just hold on that I
gave as an intuition to some

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19675-1
01:47:38.831 --> 01:47:41.409
people, but most likely the data
science.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19737-0
01:47:41.419 --> 01:47:44.725
Many of the data science books
will not tell you that this this

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19737-1
01:47:44.725 --> 01:47:47.772
is the reason why they say they
say that use 1.5 as a good

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19737-2
01:47:47.772 --> 01:47:50.923
estimate for how clear and if
your business demands that 1.8

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19737-3
01:47:50.923 --> 01:47:54.023
IQR is a better estimate based
on your own understanding of

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19737-4
01:47:54.023 --> 01:47:54.849
data, please go.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19749-0
01:47:55.869 --> 01:47:57.739
And please allow me to speak.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19752-0
01:47:56.099 --> 01:47:56.979
Uh, Mr Oswaldo?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19760-0
01:47:57.809 --> 01:48:00.229
I I have not spoken, but you
allowed me.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19775-0
01:48:00.239 --> 01:48:03.559
You you just, you know, made me
shut down.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19793-0
01:48:03.869 --> 01:48:05.209
So please allow me to speak.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19781-0
01:48:04.399 --> 01:48:04.659
No.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19825-0
01:48:04.669 --> 01:48:07.651
Now you can speak now you can
speak because of because I

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19802-0
01:48:06.619 --> 01:48:07.929
Yeah, please.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19825-1
01:48:07.651 --> 01:48:11.051
thought you wanted me to answer
the question about 3 Sigma which

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19825-2
01:48:11.051 --> 01:48:13.928
I cannot answer because the
three Sigma does not apply

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19825-3
01:48:13.928 --> 01:48:16.229
because this is a very rough
approximation.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19829-0
01:48:17.159 --> 01:48:17.749
Go ahead.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19831-0
01:48:17.799 --> 01:48:18.269
Go ahead.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19838-0
01:48:18.659 --> 01:48:19.669
I do not know you.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19846-0
01:48:19.679 --> 01:48:21.669
You are here to learn, Mr
Saurab.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19879-0
01:48:21.719 --> 01:48:24.768
So so now the question is that
when you are trying to jump then

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19879-1
01:48:24.768 --> 01:48:27.723
it has become difficult for me
to answer because The thing is

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19882-0
01:48:27.519 --> 01:48:28.249
Hell, I speak.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19879-2
01:48:27.723 --> 01:48:28.199
that this.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19884-0
01:48:29.359 --> 01:48:30.369
Yes, please go ahead.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19886-0
01:48:30.439 --> 01:48:30.669
Go ahead.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19919-0
01:48:32.999 --> 01:48:38.823
What I am trying to ask you is X
+, -, 3, Sigma where mean in

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19919-1
01:48:38.823 --> 01:48:44.459
normal distribution is mean,
median and mode is same right?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19929-0
01:48:45.039 --> 01:48:45.629
No, no, no.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19936-0
01:48:45.299 --> 01:48:46.929
That's what I was trying to ask
you.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19934-0
01:48:45.639 --> 01:48:48.399
No, no, no, no, no.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19964-0
01:48:48.409 --> 01:48:53.216
See, The thing is that if it is
a normal distribution, you may

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19964-1
01:48:53.216 --> 01:48:56.039
get mean, median, mode clothes
same.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19974-0
01:48:55.419 --> 01:48:56.959
Yeah. Yes.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20011-0
01:48:56.189 --> 01:49:00.270
So because of that, you may say
that the median, but then very

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/19987-0
01:48:59.199 --> 01:48:59.419
He's.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20011-1
01:49:00.270 --> 01:49:04.221
often when we deal with the
small samples like this, we have

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20000-0
01:49:02.979 --> 01:49:03.319
Umm.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20011-2
01:49:04.221 --> 01:49:07.719
already seen that we have taken
another sample of 20.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20035-0
01:49:07.789 --> 01:49:12.349
So we could not match the mean,
median and those, so they'll

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20028-0
01:49:11.699 --> 01:49:12.069
Umm.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20035-1
01:49:12.349 --> 01:49:13.919
seldom match exactly.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20054-0
01:49:14.269 --> 01:49:18.662
So in that sense, so saying that
X plus we Sigma is what is

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20038-0
01:49:14.599 --> 01:49:14.829
Hmm.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20054-1
01:49:18.662 --> 01:49:20.419
matching is not correct.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20075-0
01:49:20.429 --> 01:49:25.285
But then if suppose that somehow
ideal data we have got so ideal

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20079-0
01:49:25.039 --> 01:49:25.619
Hmm.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20075-1
01:49:25.285 --> 01:49:25.659
data.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20086-0
01:49:25.669 --> 01:49:27.639
This comes as a rough
approximation.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20089-0
01:49:25.929 --> 01:49:26.579
Yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20097-0
01:49:26.909 --> 01:49:28.249
Yes, yes, yes, so.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20105-0
01:49:27.649 --> 01:49:30.249
It is not a exact approximation,
a rough approximation.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20110-0
01:49:30.359 --> 01:49:32.929
Yeah, so here X is nothing but X
bar.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20132-0
01:49:32.939 --> 01:49:34.449
I am trying to say you.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20128-0
01:49:34.219 --> 01:49:35.299
Yes, yes, X bar.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20136-0
01:49:34.819 --> 01:49:35.629
So yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20162-0
01:49:35.309 --> 01:49:38.456
You can take it as a mean
because the data is perfectly

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20141-0
01:49:35.829 --> 01:49:36.289
Hmm.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20150-0
01:49:36.329 --> 01:49:39.159
Yes. Yes, yes.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20162-1
01:49:38.456 --> 01:49:39.299
symmetric, yes.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20152-0
01:49:39.169 --> 01:49:39.619
Yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20190-0
01:49:39.629 --> 01:49:43.135
So that's what I'm I'm asking
you that normal distribution,

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20190-1
01:49:43.135 --> 01:49:46.992
that's the reason I I turned the
I coined I I turned the word the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20190-2
01:49:46.992 --> 01:49:48.219
third three quartile.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20192-0
01:49:48.229 --> 01:49:48.579
Right.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20209-0
01:49:48.589 --> 01:49:52.179
So 1.5 multiplied by IQR is
nothing but three quartile.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20212-0
01:49:50.369 --> 01:49:50.819
Uh-huh.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20217-0
01:49:52.189 --> 01:49:53.309
That's what I was trying to say.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20228-0
01:49:55.739 --> 01:49:57.389
Uh, OK, OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20236-0
01:49:57.399 --> 01:49:59.489
Mr Saurav, just take it as an
intuition.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20284-0
01:49:59.499 --> 01:50:02.553
This is not a mathematical
formula saying that we are using

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20284-1
01:50:02.553 --> 01:50:05.708
identical measures with normal
distribution and box plot, but

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20274-0
01:50:04.189 --> 01:50:06.499
Got it. And.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20284-2
01:50:05.708 --> 01:50:08.609
then take that as it just as an
intuition, nothing more.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20294-0
01:50:08.499 --> 01:50:09.769
Yeah, yes, yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20323-0
01:50:08.659 --> 01:50:12.418
So most of the data science
books will tell you that take

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20323-1
01:50:12.418 --> 01:50:16.178
1.5 IQR above the median or
below the median because they

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20321-0
01:50:13.979 --> 01:50:16.409
Yes, yes, yes.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20323-2
01:50:16.178 --> 01:50:17.409
don't want to risk.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20351-0
01:50:17.419 --> 01:50:20.229
You risk telling you that median
is same as me because in that

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20346-0
01:50:20.109 --> 01:50:20.989
Yeah, got it.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20351-1
01:50:20.229 --> 01:50:21.879
case they think they are
misleading.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20349-0
01:50:22.779 --> 01:50:23.409
No problem.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20352-0
01:50:23.419 --> 01:50:23.749
Got it.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20355-0
01:50:30.799 --> 01:50:31.199
Alright.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20376-0
01:50:33.759 --> 01:50:38.389
All right, now we are seeing
that the basic statistical

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20376-1
01:50:38.389 --> 01:50:42.689
distributions can come from
several visualizations.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20386-0
01:50:42.879 --> 01:50:45.369
So one of the visualizations is
the box plot.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20408-0
01:50:48.989 --> 01:50:53.970
And we can also make histograms
we have already seen an example

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20408-1
01:50:53.970 --> 01:50:57.239
histogram and then we have
quantile plot.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20421-0
01:50:57.769 --> 01:51:03.319
So so this is an indication of
the value versus percentile.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20434-0
01:51:03.549 --> 01:51:07.609
So suppose that quantile plot is
an interesting kind of a plot.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20453-0
01:51:07.709 --> 01:51:12.339
Suppose that you got a data
which is of this kind which is

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20453-1
01:51:12.339 --> 01:51:13.359
of this kind.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20467-0
01:51:13.419 --> 01:51:18.259
OK, so which is is 1 dimensional
distribution of something.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20500-0
01:51:18.449 --> 01:51:24.126
Maybe this is representing a
something like age of some group

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20500-1
01:51:24.126 --> 01:51:30.169
of people in in a support in one
street that maybe that maybe so.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20518-0
01:51:30.219 --> 01:51:34.697
In that case, what is happening
is that you want to plot it

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20518-1
01:51:34.697 --> 01:51:36.189
because you want to.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20562-0
01:51:36.199 --> 01:51:39.854
Visualization is going to give
you an indication of the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20562-1
01:51:39.854 --> 01:51:44.096
variation in the data, but with
one dimensional data there is no

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20562-2
01:51:44.096 --> 01:51:48.077
visuals that are available, so
one visual that people use is

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20562-3
01:51:48.077 --> 01:51:49.709
known as a quantile plot.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20565-0
01:51:50.289 --> 01:51:52.499
So quantile plot works like
this.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20577-0
01:51:52.739 --> 01:51:56.229
Suppose there is a data which is
for example.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20590-0
01:51:56.239 --> 01:52:00.337
I'm plotting the unit price
along One Direction and in other

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20590-1
01:52:00.337 --> 01:52:01.009
direction.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20610-0
01:52:01.019 --> 01:52:05.854
What I'm doing is I'm plotting
the percentile value percentile

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20610-1
01:52:05.854 --> 01:52:07.849
value can from zero to 1%.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20627-0
01:52:07.919 --> 01:52:12.039
1% is 100 percentile, .75 is 75
percentile.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20630-0
01:52:12.679 --> 01:52:13.999
Then this is the median.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20649-0
01:52:16.099 --> 01:52:22.139
This is the median and this is
the Q1 and then this is this is.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20683-0
01:52:28.509 --> 01:52:33.839
This is Q3, so you can make it
plot and now you know that this

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20683-1
01:52:33.839 --> 01:52:38.324
is the place where where the
maximum and minimum are

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20683-2
01:52:38.324 --> 01:52:39.339
constrained.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20701-0
01:52:39.789 --> 01:52:45.559
0 percentile in one percentile,
but then you may get the data

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20701-1
01:52:45.559 --> 01:52:47.979
which can vary vary along.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20754-0
01:52:48.069 --> 01:52:52.783
This is this, this this so you
it can give you an indication

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20754-1
01:52:52.783 --> 01:52:57.496
that when you get 2 datasets and
then you plot and you get a

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20754-2
01:52:57.496 --> 01:53:01.669
different shapes for the
quantile plot that tells you

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20754-3
01:53:01.669 --> 01:53:05.919
about the ordering that is
available within that data.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20779-0
01:53:05.929 --> 01:53:08.338
So you just need to think about
it because we have a one

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20779-1
01:53:08.338 --> 01:53:10.789
dimensional data and we are
trying to do a visualization.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20793-0
01:53:13.069 --> 01:53:15.939
And the meanwhile, let us also
look at the other plots.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20798-0
01:53:15.989 --> 01:53:16.959
Other plots is.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20809-0
01:53:17.009 --> 01:53:19.439
Let's look at histogram and bar
graph.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20822-0
01:53:18.819 --> 01:53:25.289
So probably 11 input server
there, so probably 1 tile.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20820-0
01:53:23.389 --> 01:53:23.759
Yes, yes.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20833-0
01:53:25.919 --> 01:53:27.549
Can you go to the quantile for a
moment please?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20851-0
01:53:28.879 --> 01:53:31.869
Ohh you want me to look at a
show this slide of contact.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20856-0
01:53:31.909 --> 01:53:33.029
Yes, yes, yes, please.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20854-0
01:53:33.269 --> 01:53:33.889
OK, OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20862-0
01:53:34.679 --> 01:53:36.179
Yeah, this is the contact, yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20891-0
01:53:38.599 --> 01:53:42.682
To probably one of the use case
could be how organizations to

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20891-1
01:53:42.682 --> 01:53:45.579
the market correction of
employee salaries.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20907-0
01:53:48.069 --> 01:53:51.749
Are you are saying what can be
the use of this is it?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20912-0
01:53:51.759 --> 01:53:52.199
Is it correct?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20927-0
01:53:53.029 --> 01:53:57.741
Yeah, 11 practical scenario I
could think of is the market

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20927-1
01:53:57.741 --> 01:53:59.179
correction, right?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20930-0
01:53:59.049 --> 01:53:59.309
Yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20945-0
01:53:59.189 --> 01:53:59.699
So where?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20932-0
01:53:59.319 --> 01:53:59.569
Yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20968-0
01:53:59.619 --> 01:54:02.674
No, no, I don't know whether
you're talking about stock

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20968-1
01:54:02.674 --> 01:54:05.839
market, but what what we are
saying is that, yeah, OK, So

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20956-0
01:54:02.719 --> 01:54:02.989
No.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20970-0
01:54:05.609 --> 01:54:06.069
OK, OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/20968-2
01:54:05.839 --> 01:54:07.039
what, what do you see?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21040-0
01:54:07.049 --> 01:54:11.121
What the quantile plot is
telling you is that there is the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21040-1
01:54:11.121 --> 01:54:15.263
greater concentration of the
element, so that is what it is

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21040-2
01:54:15.263 --> 01:54:19.404
trying to tell you, which are
the for example closer to the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21040-3
01:54:19.404 --> 01:54:22.924
median or closer to 30
percentile or closer to the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21040-4
01:54:22.924 --> 01:54:27.410
because the the plot is going to
take a higher incline there and

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21040-5
01:54:27.410 --> 01:54:29.619
lower incline at another places.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21068-0
01:54:29.629 --> 01:54:33.439
So based on the incline of the
plot at various places, you get

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21068-1
01:54:33.439 --> 01:54:37.189
an indication that is Daddy more
concentration at some place.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21073-0
01:54:37.419 --> 01:54:38.679
So suppose that.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21087-0
01:54:39.059 --> 01:54:44.605
Suppose that let me let me give
you a quantile plot quantile

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21087-1
01:54:44.605 --> 01:54:45.059
plot.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21112-0
01:54:45.099 --> 01:54:50.713
Let us say this quantile plot
has got 80 as the median and

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21112-1
01:54:50.713 --> 01:54:54.329
1:20 as the highest 40 as the
lowest.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21126-0
01:54:54.619 --> 01:54:59.778
So now let me make a alternate
quantile plot, which is in

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21126-1
01:54:59.778 --> 01:55:00.489
extreme.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21134-0
01:55:00.659 --> 01:55:03.069
So now I'm saying that.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21188-0
01:55:10.419 --> 01:55:16.068
This I can have as a plot
because most of the elements are

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21188-1
01:55:16.068 --> 01:55:22.004
closer to 40 closer to the 80
and so so many of more elements

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21188-2
01:55:22.004 --> 01:55:28.132
are closer to 80 than to 40, and
similarly I can have something

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21188-3
01:55:28.132 --> 01:55:29.089
like this.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21221-0
01:55:29.919 --> 01:55:34.600
Something like like this again
indicating that there are very

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21221-1
01:55:34.600 --> 01:55:38.980
few elements which are closer to
100% so it is more of an

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21221-2
01:55:38.980 --> 01:55:41.849
indication of the way it is
changing.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21237-0
01:55:41.899 --> 01:55:46.059
Just think about it, because I I
cannot explain these graphs.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21289-0
01:55:46.099 --> 01:55:50.247
So you people need to have your
own bring in some inclusion and

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21251-0
01:55:46.109 --> 01:55:47.439
And then they have.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21289-1
01:55:50.247 --> 01:55:54.136
try to see that, but then this
is a quantile plot is a good

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21289-2
01:55:54.136 --> 01:55:58.349
indication you you take the your
own some data and then plot it.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21310-0
01:55:58.759 --> 01:56:02.557
Then you will appreciate it
better rather than looking for

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21310-1
01:56:02.557 --> 01:56:06.612
my English and then saying that,
OK, this word, that word know

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21310-2
01:56:06.612 --> 01:56:07.449
that alright.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21315-0
01:56:15.449 --> 01:56:16.529
OK, OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21326-0
01:56:16.929 --> 01:56:20.539
Uh, Mr Raghavendra is saying,
what is this?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21336-0
01:56:20.549 --> 01:56:22.209
This is about the previous year
Question Paper.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21338-0
01:56:22.349 --> 01:56:22.679
See.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21364-0
01:56:22.689 --> 01:56:25.706
Don't rush for the question
papers, so I hope if you learn

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21364-1
01:56:25.706 --> 01:56:28.621
the subject are you are you
really studying only for the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21364-2
01:56:28.621 --> 01:56:28.979
grades?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21398-0
01:56:30.359 --> 01:56:33.693
We will give you some sample
question but some time with no

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21398-1
01:56:33.693 --> 01:56:37.082
warranty, no guarantee will give
you some sample, but I hope

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21398-2
01:56:37.082 --> 01:56:38.749
you're not in here for grades.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21403-0
01:56:38.759 --> 01:56:40.129
The grades will come
automatically.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21417-0
01:56:40.139 --> 01:56:41.299
Somebody will get some grade.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21448-0
01:56:41.309 --> 01:56:43.836
Somebody will get other grade
and in any case, even if I give

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21448-1
01:56:43.836 --> 01:56:46.486
you all the question papers and
guidebooks again, I have to give

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21448-2
01:56:46.486 --> 01:56:47.709
you a variation of that grade.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21490-0
01:56:48.339 --> 01:56:52.350
But then focus on learning, so
we will give you some

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21490-1
01:56:52.350 --> 01:56:56.891
indication, but then the the, I
the obviously there will be

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21490-2
01:56:56.891 --> 01:57:01.280
changes that keep happening
between various faculties and

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21490-3
01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:04.459
various topics in the the
Question Paper.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21503-0
01:57:19.969 --> 01:57:22.039
Alright, so now we have got.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21513-0
01:57:22.169 --> 01:57:25.059
Let's talk about histogram and
bargraph.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21520-0
01:57:25.249 --> 01:57:27.199
I hope the the difference is
clear.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21533-0
01:57:27.209 --> 01:57:30.059
Bargraph is talking about a
categorical variable versus the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21533-1
01:57:30.059 --> 01:57:30.439
numbers.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21564-0
01:57:30.669 --> 01:57:35.335
Histogram is a range versus
numbers, so that is how we use

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21564-1
01:57:35.335 --> 01:57:39.844
the nomenclature and then
histogram has the ability even

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21564-2
01:57:39.844 --> 01:57:41.979
when histogram is at least.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21588-0
01:57:41.989 --> 01:57:44.954
Of course it needs to have
sufficient number of intervals,

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21588-1
01:57:44.954 --> 01:57:47.769
but the histograms can tell you
more than the box plot.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21614-0
01:57:47.909 --> 01:57:51.105
If you look at these two
datasets, they they have the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21614-1
01:57:51.105 --> 01:57:54.774
same five point summary, but
then the histogram is giving you

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21614-2
01:57:54.774 --> 01:57:55.839
a different shape.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21617-0
01:57:59.499 --> 01:57:59.989
Alright.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21644-0
01:58:00.079 --> 01:58:02.933
And the quantile plot we
discussed, and it is also

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21644-1
01:58:02.933 --> 01:58:05.954
possible that similar to
quantile plot, we can make a

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21644-2
01:58:05.954 --> 01:58:07.409
quantile to quantile plot.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21669-0
01:58:07.679 --> 01:58:11.681
So what we are saying is that
here we are looking at the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21669-1
01:58:11.681 --> 01:58:14.489
example is taken from the T4 I
believe.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21687-0
01:58:15.099 --> 01:58:19.069
So suppose that there are two
branches of the same store.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21716-0
01:58:19.359 --> 01:58:22.938
For example, there is a same
retail chain that has got two

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21716-1
01:58:22.938 --> 01:58:26.455
stores at two different places
and then they are stocking

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21716-2
01:58:26.455 --> 01:58:27.729
different same items.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21766-0
01:58:27.739 --> 01:58:31.707
Let's say at both the places,
but then in some store installed

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21766-1
01:58:31.707 --> 01:58:35.674
one the attending to sell more
high priced item and in Store 2

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21766-2
01:58:35.674 --> 01:58:38.949
they're trending to high sell
more low priced item.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21780-0
01:58:39.269 --> 01:58:44.106
In that case, the the quantile
to quantile plot will be able to

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21780-1
01:58:44.106 --> 01:58:45.089
capture that.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21802-0
01:58:47.329 --> 01:58:51.154
So you're looking at the branch
1 percentile and branch 2

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21802-1
01:58:51.154 --> 01:58:51.879
percentile.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21818-0
01:58:52.969 --> 01:58:56.999
So what you are doing is you are
doing is branch one.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21830-0
01:58:57.209 --> 01:59:01.386
Suppose that the you are
plotting you are plotting like

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21830-1
01:59:01.386 --> 01:59:01.759
this.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21837-0
01:59:01.769 --> 01:59:03.659
Suppose that for branch one.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21851-0
01:59:03.749 --> 01:59:07.589
So let me let me write that how
do you plot branch one?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21856-0
01:59:09.639 --> 01:59:10.449
Uh.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21860-0
01:59:10.499 --> 01:59:14.599
The then percentile percentile.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21869-0
01:59:14.729 --> 01:59:17.239
OK, this is one we want to
capture.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21891-0
01:59:17.369 --> 01:59:20.999
So now let us say 10 percentile,
20 percentile, 30 percentile and

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21891-1
01:59:20.999 --> 01:59:22.099
all can be captured.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21897-0
01:59:22.269 --> 01:59:23.899
Then Branch one branch two.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21915-0
01:59:24.309 --> 01:59:27.559
So now what we are saying is 10
percentile for branch one is.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21929-0
01:59:27.569 --> 01:59:31.309
Let us say is 50 and branch two
is 51.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21944-0
01:59:31.509 --> 01:59:34.349
So we are going to make a plot
50 versus 51, OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21948-0
01:59:34.389 --> 01:59:35.729
And then 20 percentile.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/21960-0
01:59:35.949 --> 01:59:38.859
So this is 55 and then 54.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22007-0
01:59:39.229 --> 01:59:42.344
So we are making a plot of this
point, and then we are

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22007-1
01:59:42.344 --> 01:59:45.912
connecting all these points and
that is going to indicate that

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22007-2
01:59:45.912 --> 01:59:49.084
in one branch there is a
different trend of the sale of

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22007-3
01:59:49.084 --> 01:59:52.539
the product based on the price
compared to the other branch.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22019-0
01:59:55.969 --> 01:59:58.259
And the scatter plot is much
easier one.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22025-0
01:59:58.329 --> 02:00:00.179
I hope we frequently use it.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22036-0
02:00:00.189 --> 02:00:02.289
We commonly use when there are
two variables.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22050-0
02:00:02.299 --> 02:00:08.279
We simply make if scatter plot
and scatterplot is is what is.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22060-0
02:00:08.289 --> 02:00:11.409
What is the scatter plot telling
does?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22078-0
02:00:11.419 --> 02:00:14.318
Does anyone want to make a
reading of the scatter plot and

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22078-1
02:00:14.318 --> 02:00:15.399
want to say something?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22098-0
02:00:16.959 --> 02:00:19.759
Feel free if you if you feel
like I'll wait for a few.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22108-0
02:00:19.199 --> 02:00:22.954
You do some correlation between
the two variables like how are

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22108-1
02:00:22.954 --> 02:00:23.729
they related?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22116-0
02:00:24.759 --> 02:00:26.649
OK, it is telling you the
correlation.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22130-0
02:00:26.659 --> 02:00:31.068
Do you see any correlation in
the scatter plot that you have

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22130-1
02:00:31.068 --> 02:00:31.429
seen?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22147-0
02:00:32.439 --> 02:00:38.074
Combining what I said this,
could you please show the OK so

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22147-1
02:00:38.074 --> 02:00:39.389
and respected?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22148-0
02:00:38.599 --> 02:00:40.189
Median translations.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22173-0
02:00:41.849 --> 02:00:46.132
OK, first first when checking
those is blot, it's the the data

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22173-1
02:00:46.132 --> 02:00:48.239
which they are choking off for.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22186-0
02:00:48.249 --> 02:00:50.899
Uh, what's the actual price and
how much it is?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22193-0
02:00:50.909 --> 02:00:52.019
Show that's.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22202-0
02:00:52.089 --> 02:00:52.259
Yes.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22216-0
02:00:52.109 --> 02:00:56.904
That's the first thing and in
which perspective which the same

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22216-1
02:00:56.904 --> 02:00:59.949
items are different item doesn't
stock.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22261-0
02:01:02.289 --> 02:01:06.185
The items which we are so which
is buy from different, it can be

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22261-1
02:01:06.185 --> 02:01:09.541
from different areas and
different styles because there

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22261-2
02:01:09.541 --> 02:01:11.399
was no any information on that.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22281-0
02:01:11.849 --> 02:01:15.846
What we can summarize in this
plot is space and how much it

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22259-0
02:01:11.979 --> 02:01:12.409
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22271-0
02:01:12.419 --> 02:01:13.459
OK, fine, fine.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22281-1
02:01:15.846 --> 02:01:16.179
sold.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22304-0
02:01:16.249 --> 02:01:16.549
That's it.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22330-0
02:01:16.719 --> 02:01:21.166
So the minimum value for the
items is 40 and maximum is still

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22306-0
02:01:17.559 --> 02:01:18.309
Fine, Mr.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22330-1
02:01:21.166 --> 02:01:25.684
120 and maximum items bought are
in the range somewhere around

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22330-2
02:01:25.684 --> 02:01:25.899
80.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22358-0
02:01:25.909 --> 02:01:29.199
If we go back to the graph 8200.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22338-0
02:01:26.349 --> 02:01:26.759
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22340-0
02:01:26.769 --> 02:01:27.279
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22348-0
02:01:27.769 --> 02:01:28.339
No, I'm.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22354-0
02:01:28.349 --> 02:01:29.479
I'm actually looking for.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22356-0
02:01:29.789 --> 02:01:30.219
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22360-0
02:01:30.229 --> 02:01:31.679
OK, fine, fine.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22372-0
02:01:31.729 --> 02:01:33.779
Just just let me put it this
way.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22408-0
02:01:34.229 --> 02:01:38.201
I am looking more for whether
have you noticed some pattern

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22408-1
02:01:38.201 --> 02:01:41.709
which is a very approximate
pattern that the reason?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22415-0
02:01:40.749 --> 02:01:42.239
There's no Yep.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22470-0
02:01:40.909 --> 02:01:44.717
So if the item is too cheap,
then it would not be sold, and

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22449-0
02:01:43.029 --> 02:01:46.789
And what close to the normal
because it represents Bell.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22417-0
02:01:43.139 --> 02:01:43.499
Yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22461-0
02:01:43.549 --> 02:01:46.439
And and then you you can see
some patterns, right?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22470-1
02:01:44.717 --> 02:01:47.699
if it is too costly, it would
not be sold too.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22472-0
02:01:45.909 --> 02:01:47.789
It's somewhat most of the normal
thing.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22464-0
02:01:46.909 --> 02:01:47.189
Curves.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22471-0
02:01:47.579 --> 02:01:47.699
But.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22467-0
02:01:48.849 --> 02:01:49.239
Yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22491-0
02:01:49.249 --> 02:01:52.587
So he did a very, very rough
pattern, but then you you have

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22495-0
02:01:50.009 --> 02:01:50.169
That.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22491-1
02:01:52.587 --> 02:01:53.699
got some indication.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22516-0
02:01:53.809 --> 02:01:56.533
So in fact, our course is all
about finding whether there is

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22510-0
02:01:54.889 --> 02:01:55.619
What with?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22516-1
02:01:56.533 --> 02:01:57.649
we can catch the pattern.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22526-0
02:01:57.529 --> 02:01:58.739
Normal distribution.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22533-0
02:01:59.539 --> 02:02:01.119
No, no, it is not normal
distribution.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22539-0
02:01:59.919 --> 02:02:01.069
And what close to the norm?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22568-0
02:02:01.129 --> 02:02:04.698
What we are saying is that there
is a tendency of people to buy

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22568-1
02:02:04.698 --> 02:02:08.211
middle level price products and
ads come to you as you come to

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22568-2
02:02:08.211 --> 02:02:09.549
the lower price product.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22581-0
02:02:09.939 --> 02:02:13.549
There is a very few buyers or
something like that items sold.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22622-0
02:02:13.559 --> 02:02:16.894
I am assuming the number of
buyers and similarly when it is

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22622-1
02:02:16.894 --> 02:02:20.118
coming to the higher price
product and there are very few

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22622-2
02:02:20.118 --> 02:02:23.230
buyers is that are you seeing
the same pattern that I'm

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22622-3
02:02:23.230 --> 02:02:23.619
seeing?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22628-0
02:02:24.899 --> 02:02:25.899
Yeah, that makes sense.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22629-0
02:02:25.919 --> 02:02:27.199
OK, alright, alright.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22634-0
02:02:31.219 --> 02:02:31.779
So.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22648-0
02:02:31.839 --> 02:02:34.895
So now what we are saying is
that these graphs can tell you

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22648-1
02:02:34.895 --> 02:02:35.659
several things.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22667-0
02:02:35.889 --> 02:02:39.826
So so for example, we are seeing
various types of correlations,

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22667-1
02:02:39.826 --> 02:02:41.979
so this is a positive
correlation.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22695-0
02:02:42.359 --> 02:02:45.724
So when we are saying that as X
is increasing, Y is also

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22695-1
02:02:45.724 --> 02:02:48.439
increased and this is a negative
correlation.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22707-0
02:02:48.589 --> 02:02:53.623
So as X increases, Y has a
tendency to decrease, reduce,

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22707-1
02:02:53.623 --> 02:02:54.329
correct?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22720-0
02:02:54.809 --> 02:02:57.659
So adds let me put it this way,
Ajax increases.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22753-0
02:02:57.869 --> 02:03:02.436
So why is it tending to regules
and this here as X increases, Y

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22753-1
02:03:02.436 --> 02:03:06.860
increases up to set endpoint and
beyond that point there is a

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22753-2
02:03:06.860 --> 02:03:08.359
negative correlation.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22770-0
02:03:08.449 --> 02:03:12.649
So you may start looking for
certain patterns and there can

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22770-1
02:03:12.649 --> 02:03:12.859
be.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22786-0
02:03:12.869 --> 02:03:16.527
Sometimes you can work with end
up getting a data which is

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22786-1
02:03:16.527 --> 02:03:17.829
totally uncorrelated.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22789-0
02:03:17.839 --> 02:03:18.709
As you can see here.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22803-0
02:03:20.849 --> 02:03:23.399
OK, so this is all I wanted to
cover.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22808-0
02:03:23.409 --> 02:03:25.519
So I'm now open to questions.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22825-0
02:03:28.319 --> 02:03:30.669
So can you take me a slide #19?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22836-0
02:03:31.489 --> 02:03:33.479
Slight number 19, is that
correct?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22835-0
02:03:33.909 --> 02:03:34.839
Right, right.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22839-0
02:03:34.849 --> 02:03:35.319
Correct. Correct.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22840-0
02:03:35.499 --> 02:03:35.799
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22862-0
02:03:41.249 --> 02:03:44.879
Slide #19, I am I here in this
one?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22853-0
02:03:42.349 --> 02:03:43.219
Right here.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22857-0
02:03:43.289 --> 02:03:44.909
So yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22871-0
02:03:44.919 --> 02:03:45.889
Correct, correct. Right.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22864-0
02:03:45.669 --> 02:03:46.079
Yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22873-0
02:03:45.899 --> 02:03:46.109
Correct.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22866-0
02:03:46.089 --> 02:03:46.339
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22869-0
02:03:46.399 --> 02:03:46.989
OK, good.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22875-0
02:03:46.999 --> 02:03:47.359
Good. Yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22890-0
02:03:47.899 --> 02:03:52.539
So so this is 35 + 22.5.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22911-0
02:03:52.989 --> 02:03:56.558
That is, you know, 57.5 this is
1 whiskers you talked about,

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22911-1
02:03:56.558 --> 02:03:56.909
right?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22915-0
02:03:57.799 --> 02:03:58.169
Yes.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22927-0
02:03:58.179 --> 02:03:59.299
I missed that Trump.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22930-0
02:03:58.179 --> 02:04:00.679
So we are saying that the 70 is
and how clear, right?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22947-0
02:04:01.739 --> 02:04:04.289
To here as per this calculation.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22963-0
02:04:04.299 --> 02:04:08.409
So 57.5 is 1 whisker points,
another is minus 2.5.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22977-0
02:04:08.419 --> 02:04:08.829
Am I correct?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/22980-0
02:04:09.519 --> 02:04:11.449
No, but there is no minus 2.5.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23002-0
02:04:11.459 --> 02:04:14.762
So we say that there is no
outlier on lower side, but there

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23002-1
02:04:14.762 --> 02:04:16.359
is an outlier on higher side.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23013-0
02:04:16.959 --> 02:04:20.029
So you use the term whiskers
right?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23032-0
02:04:20.039 --> 02:04:21.559
What exactly that Tom says.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23033-0
02:04:21.849 --> 02:04:23.199
Can can you be little louder?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23051-0
02:04:23.209 --> 02:04:24.909
Your voice is coming very low to
me.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23045-0
02:04:23.679 --> 02:04:23.969
Right.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23073-0
02:04:24.809 --> 02:04:29.262
Yeah, you you said that whiskers
right in one point of time, I I

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23069-0
02:04:28.779 --> 02:04:29.929
Uh, OK, OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23073-1
02:04:29.262 --> 02:04:29.399
I.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23083-0
02:04:29.939 --> 02:04:33.289
OK, whiskers are something that
you put in the.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23099-0
02:04:33.459 --> 02:04:36.369
So the viscous actually people
put at two places.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23108-0
02:04:36.739 --> 02:04:40.439
So one is suppose that there is
a.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23117-0
02:04:40.499 --> 02:04:43.269
There is a minimum and maximum
of the data.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23151-0
02:04:43.739 --> 02:04:47.512
Then what you say is that the
acceptable maximum and

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23151-1
02:04:47.512 --> 02:04:52.138
acceptable minimum is one thing
where they plot the whiskers and

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23151-2
02:04:52.138 --> 02:04:55.199
then the this is this is the way
they put.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23168-0
02:04:59.569 --> 02:05:02.604
OK, so that there may be some
data here in some data may be

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23168-1
02:05:02.604 --> 02:05:03.009
outside.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23177-0
02:05:08.059 --> 02:05:10.749
So, so the OK, so now.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23181-0
02:05:10.799 --> 02:05:11.689
OK, fine.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23194-0
02:05:11.939 --> 02:05:14.949
The whiskers the it's talking
about is these lines.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23197-0
02:05:14.959 --> 02:05:15.329
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23213-0
02:05:15.339 --> 02:05:19.219
The the slide is talking about
this, but sometimes people also

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23213-1
02:05:19.219 --> 02:05:20.389
put the lines here.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23221-0
02:05:20.399 --> 02:05:22.209
So OK, so there are two things.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23244-0
02:05:22.219 --> 02:05:26.591
So what the slide is saying is
these two lines, but people also

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23244-1
02:05:26.591 --> 02:05:27.889
put the lines here.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23252-0
02:05:28.689 --> 02:05:30.439
Am I have you confused you or is
it clear?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23257-0
02:05:32.809 --> 02:05:33.099
No.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23285-0
02:05:33.109 --> 02:05:35.980
Is there any relationship we
have with course with that IQ or

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23285-1
02:05:35.980 --> 02:05:37.739
that's what I'm trying to
understand?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23291-0
02:05:38.309 --> 02:05:40.039
Dave Whiskers are no, no, no,
no.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23317-0
02:05:40.049 --> 02:05:44.720
Biscuits are just indicating the
lines that the the convention of

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23317-1
02:05:44.720 --> 02:05:48.259
plotting the five five point
summary or box plot.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23324-0
02:05:49.469 --> 02:05:50.449
OK, OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23361-0
02:05:50.209 --> 02:05:54.227
So you take the, you put the box
from Q1 to Q3, but outside that

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23361-1
02:05:54.227 --> 02:05:58.122
you only have the lines and the
horizontal lines are the range

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23361-2
02:05:58.122 --> 02:06:01.769
and the vertical lines or the OR
the minimum and maximums.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23386-0
02:06:03.159 --> 02:06:06.965
So this is representing the
minimum and maximum and this is

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23366-0
02:06:03.669 --> 02:06:04.119
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23373-0
02:06:04.209 --> 02:06:04.509
Thank you.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23386-1
02:06:06.965 --> 02:06:09.629
representing that there are
values along.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23393-0
02:06:09.749 --> 02:06:11.319
See, these are all conventions,
no.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23404-0
02:06:11.329 --> 02:06:13.839
So nothing like nothing really
to explain.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23411-0
02:06:13.849 --> 02:06:16.259
So this is the shape of what
they do.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23433-0
02:06:20.869 --> 02:06:21.889
Are we In Sync, Mr?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23460-0
02:06:20.929 --> 02:06:24.558
So do we need to remember these
all different types of plotting

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23428-0
02:06:22.789 --> 02:06:23.179
Yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23431-0
02:06:23.189 --> 02:06:23.499
Thank you.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23447-0
02:06:23.509 --> 02:06:23.829
Thank you.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23460-1
02:06:24.558 --> 02:06:26.089
and that data analysis are?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23456-0
02:06:24.599 --> 02:06:26.889
No, no, this five point somebody
so close.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23475-0
02:06:26.899 --> 02:06:31.650
You, you, you are going to use
it so frequently when you do the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23475-1
02:06:31.650 --> 02:06:32.689
data analysis.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23482-0
02:06:33.139 --> 02:06:34.529
So yeah, you may.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23502-0
02:06:34.539 --> 02:06:37.331
Yeah, this I think we'll, I I do
not think anybody had a

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23502-1
02:06:37.331 --> 02:06:38.849
challenge and remembering this.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23521-0
02:06:38.859 --> 02:06:41.950
So this is this is the way the
any book you look at the five

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23521-1
02:06:41.950 --> 02:06:42.659
point summary.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23525-0
02:06:42.669 --> 02:06:43.569
This is how they travel.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23535-0
02:06:49.879 --> 02:06:52.049
Any other question that anyone
has?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23558-0
02:06:56.689 --> 02:07:00.779
Uh, so any data visualization
tool you would recommend us to

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23558-1
02:07:00.779 --> 02:07:01.919
put our hands on?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23573-0
02:07:03.699 --> 02:07:08.559
I think we see the data
visualization even in Python.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23582-0
02:07:08.569 --> 02:07:11.079
You can do it using the Mac Plot
library.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23616-0
02:07:12.129 --> 02:07:17.204
Uh, but you can use certainly
use the the tools that are

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23616-1
02:07:17.204 --> 02:07:22.013
available outside Python also,
but I nothing like the

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23616-2
02:07:22.013 --> 02:07:26.999
visualization of what we cover
is really simple things.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23618-0
02:07:27.519 --> 02:07:28.339
So.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23629-0
02:07:28.389 --> 02:07:32.429
So which you can always actually
with the Mac Plot library.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23634-0
02:07:34.299 --> 02:07:34.949
Got it.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23683-0
02:07:35.839 --> 02:07:40.436
So just trying to understand in
this entire course so far

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23683-1
02:07:40.436 --> 02:07:45.192
introduction to data science,
will we also be preparing and

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23683-2
02:07:45.192 --> 02:07:49.789
preparing the dashboards or
presenting graphical present?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23678-0
02:07:48.419 --> 02:07:50.069
Not the dashboards. No.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23681-0
02:07:50.079 --> 02:07:50.429
No.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23703-0
02:07:50.499 --> 02:07:54.510
See the dashboard meaning is
certainly represents a business

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23703-1
02:07:54.510 --> 02:07:58.060
is having some critical
parameters and you want to do

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23703-2
02:07:58.060 --> 02:07:58.389
that.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23725-0
02:07:58.659 --> 02:08:03.288
No, it is unlikely that we will
go into because our focus is

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23725-1
02:08:03.288 --> 02:08:05.489
more on finding the patterns.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23745-0
02:08:05.799 --> 02:08:09.282
So you will call dashboard when
you have got 10 critical

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23745-1
02:08:09.282 --> 02:08:11.359
parameters that you want to
show.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23755-0
02:08:11.889 --> 02:08:15.389
So I do not think we will.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23787-0
02:08:14.309 --> 02:08:20.132
OK, fear of maybe my question
was wrong, but yeah, considering

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23767-0
02:08:15.399 --> 02:08:16.759
We will create a dashboard.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23787-1
02:08:20.132 --> 02:08:24.199
will link the patron patron
identification.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23804-0
02:08:23.869 --> 02:08:26.482
Young at the pattern that you
that you will show in a

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23806-0
02:08:24.369 --> 02:08:25.769
So we'll be doing.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23804-1
02:08:26.482 --> 02:08:27.159
graphical way.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23808-0
02:08:27.169 --> 02:08:27.619
Why not?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23824-0
02:08:27.669 --> 02:08:29.939
Yeah, yeah, that you can always
show it in a graphical way.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23827-0
02:08:28.009 --> 02:08:28.239
Hmm.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23830-0
02:08:28.909 --> 02:08:29.189
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23846-0
02:08:30.029 --> 02:08:33.099
So for example, you are making a
linear regression, so why not?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23852-0
02:08:30.519 --> 02:08:33.849
OK, everybody practice tools.
Hmm.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23853-0
02:08:33.109 --> 02:08:34.859
Why can't you show it in link?
Yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23873-0
02:08:36.349 --> 02:08:39.939
Will we be practicing to say
along with you in this course?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23891-0
02:08:40.749 --> 02:08:45.229
Uh, see, I think see we will not
have enough enough time to cover

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23891-1
02:08:45.229 --> 02:08:46.519
Python extensively.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23958-0
02:08:46.529 --> 02:08:50.622
Python is a common language for
all your courses, and all of us

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23958-1
02:08:50.622 --> 02:08:54.780
will be giving you a little bit
NILAN on Python, but you need to

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23958-2
02:08:54.780 --> 02:08:58.745
explore it on your own because
we have some webinars where we

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23958-3
02:08:58.745 --> 02:09:02.582
can give you some exposure, but
you need to explore because

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23958-4
02:09:02.582 --> 02:09:06.484
there is so many libraries and
so much of publicly available

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/23958-5
02:09:06.484 --> 02:09:07.379
documentation.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/24003-0
02:09:07.809 --> 02:09:12.710
So we will not be able to cover
Python in a few hours, so you

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/24003-1
02:09:12.710 --> 02:09:17.452
you have to explore and and we
will expect that you develop

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/24003-2
02:09:17.452 --> 02:09:21.800
some level of proficiency so
that you can do solve and

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/24003-3
02:09:21.800 --> 02:09:22.669
assignment.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/24008-0
02:09:22.729 --> 02:09:23.789
You can do the assignment.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/24044-0
02:09:23.839 --> 02:09:27.248
We will give you the background,
so some level of exposure we can

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/24044-1
02:09:27.248 --> 02:09:30.400
give you, but then you need to,
but I just want to four, one

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/24044-2
02:09:30.400 --> 02:09:33.189
that you have to do significant
exploration yourself.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/24048-0
02:09:33.779 --> 02:09:35.449
The definitely, Sir, definitely.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/24059-0
02:09:35.559 --> 02:09:37.389
Just an heads up would be
enough, Sir.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/24076-0
02:09:37.539 --> 02:09:38.679
Like we need to do what?

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/24067-0
02:09:37.979 --> 02:09:38.249
Yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/24071-0
02:09:38.259 --> 02:09:38.409
Yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/24102-0
02:09:38.419 --> 02:09:42.049
We we will give you some, some
we will hopefully we will have

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/24102-1
02:09:42.049 --> 02:09:45.678
take some either Colab notebook
or something just show how to

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/24102-2
02:09:45.678 --> 02:09:46.439
play with it.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/24124-0
02:09:46.989 --> 02:09:49.986
But there there is a lot of
publicly available

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/24121-0
02:09:47.239 --> 02:09:48.259
Perfect. Yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/24124-1
02:09:49.986 --> 02:09:50.879
documentation.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/24129-0
02:09:51.109 --> 02:09:52.419
The language documentation.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/24150-0
02:09:52.429 --> 02:09:56.308
It's a language manually ONLINE
language language so so you need

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/24150-1
02:09:56.308 --> 02:09:57.979
to be willing to look at it.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/24157-0
02:09:58.799 --> 02:09:59.019
Sure.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/24201-0
02:09:59.839 --> 02:10:03.720
So it's already given as a part
of audit Course 4 sessions we

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/24201-1
02:10:03.720 --> 02:10:07.414
had with pythons which span
across basics of Python how to

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/24201-2
02:10:07.414 --> 02:10:10.419
do data visualizations and all
other stuff the.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/24195-0
02:10:09.649 --> 02:10:10.379
OK. Very good.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/24199-0
02:10:10.449 --> 02:10:11.219
Yeah, very good. Yeah.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/24202-0
02:10:11.229 --> 02:10:11.549
Yeah, right.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/24207-0
02:10:18.989 --> 02:10:19.389
OK.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/24215-0
02:10:19.439 --> 02:10:22.519
If there are no more questions,
we'll close the session.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/24219-0
02:10:24.419 --> 02:10:24.699
All right.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/24228-0
02:10:30.279 --> 02:10:30.719
Thank you.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/24240-0
02:10:31.539 --> 02:10:32.279
So thank you.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/24235-0
02:10:32.029 --> 02:10:32.659
Yeah, sure.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/24241-0
02:10:32.209 --> 02:10:32.659
Thank you, Sir.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/24238-0
02:10:32.669 --> 02:10:33.079
Thank you.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/24243-0
02:10:33.209 --> 02:10:33.529
Thank you.

571f5535-7cba-46e4-b51e-f80c9ecba702/24249-0
02:10:36.029 --> 02:10:36.689
I think we'll get some.
