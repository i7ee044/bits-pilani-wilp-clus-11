00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:14.159
Good evening.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/120-0
00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:18.249
Are there any questions from
what we had discussed so far?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/155-0
00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:32.852
Ohh so the guarding the uh hey,
I love going through the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/155-1
00:00:32.852 --> 00:00:36.459
textbook regarding the quantile
plots.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/170-0
00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:41.009
FYI, is given as I -, .5 /.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/181-0
00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:43.869
I was wondering where the .5
came from.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/184-0
00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:45.409
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/195-0
00:00:45.419 --> 00:00:48.239
OK, so so this is you're talking
about.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/231-0
00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.180
The quantile plot is it so in
the quantile plot in the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/220-0
00:00:51.849 --> 00:00:53.549
Yes, yes, yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/231-1
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.350
quantile plot, this is the book
you are looking at is handbook

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/231-2
00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.409
attendance book.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/246-0
00:00:57.419 --> 00:01:01.309
This is a handbook is T4 and
dance book is T1.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/290-0
00:01:03.419 --> 00:01:07.062
Uh, so I put him with the
textbook, but the formula for FI

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/290-1
00:01:07.062 --> 00:01:10.829
remember, I was just trying to
find out how the information.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/279-0
00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:09.359
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/282-0
00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:09.779
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/285-0
00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:11.779
OK, OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/302-0
00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:14.939
I think this is a good thing for
us to discuss in canvas.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/309-0
00:01:15.089 --> 00:01:16.119
Is that good?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/313-0
00:01:16.129 --> 00:01:16.919
Mr Gopi Krishna.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/318-0
00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:18.559
Shut shut.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/320-0
00:01:19.339 --> 00:01:20.369
Yeah, please post it.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/327-0
00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:21.029
Please post it.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/347-0
00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:24.072
In any case, there's it's a
something in the textbook, so

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/347-1
00:01:24.072 --> 00:01:24.909
we'll see there.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/366-0
00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:28.069
Is there a reason for the author
to put put that in the formula,

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/366-1
00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:28.759
and if so, why?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/379-0
00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:34.309
Alright, OK, I I think I'll
proceed further.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/405-0
00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:37.377
I haven't heard any other
question, and in any case we can

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/405-1
00:01:37.377 --> 00:01:38.569
talk as things come up.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/409-0
00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:40.859
Sir, Sir, one quick question.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/417-0
00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.699
Yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/432-0
00:01:41.839 --> 00:01:44.695
Uh, can can you please once
again tell us the difference

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/432-1
00:01:44.695 --> 00:01:46.899
between quantile plot and the
scatter plot?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/450-0
00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:48.869
I I'm sure we have discussed it
last week.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/442-0
00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:48.269
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/444-0
00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.529
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/446-0
00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:49.249
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/448-0
00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:49.949
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/459-0
00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:52.729
OK, see, the quantile plot is
like this.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/470-0
00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:59.149
Suppose that suppose that you
have observed some products in.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/490-0
00:01:59.559 --> 00:02:03.848
Suppose that you started
checking the price of what can

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/490-1
00:02:03.848 --> 00:02:06.069
be the what can be the thing?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/500-0
00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:08.389
See, let's say onion price in 10
shops.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/502-0
00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:09.419
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/596-0
00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.960
And then they range is from ₹20
a cage to ₹70 a cage and there

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/596-1
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.043
is no way you will be able to
represent the way people are

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/596-2
00:02:18.043 --> 00:02:22.335
selling onions because it is A1
dimensional data and we never

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/596-3
00:02:22.335 --> 00:02:26.211
have the when the things are
identical and then you are

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/596-4
00:02:26.211 --> 00:02:30.156
observing the same thing
multiple times, there is no way

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/596-5
00:02:30.156 --> 00:02:34.101
to plot so quantile plot is
giving you an opportunity by

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/596-6
00:02:34.101 --> 00:02:38.392
creating artificially in X axis
so that X axis is what is the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/596-7
00:02:38.392 --> 00:02:39.569
percentile value.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/600-0
00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:41.419
Uh, what?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/613-0
00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:45.059
Is that what is the actual value
for a certain percentile?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/620-0
00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:47.499
So for example 20.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/629-0
00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.739
So let me put this in the
screen.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/631-0
00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:52.939
So.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/634-0
00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:53.799
So what?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/647-0
00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:57.384
What you had done is you
observed some something, some

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/647-1
00:02:57.384 --> 00:02:57.959
variable.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/677-0
00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:11.569
OK, some variable and the values
are 20253035405512345660.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/700-0
00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:19.169
7585 is OK 123456798910.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/722-0
00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.475
So now you've got some product
is being is sold in the market

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/722-1
00:03:23.475 --> 00:03:25.389
from ranging from ₹20 to ₹100.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/737-0
00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:30.209
But there is no way you can
represent it in a visual way.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/757-0
00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:35.560
So one way you can do it is that
so this is let us roughly divide

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/757-1
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.069
this into quantiles.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/769-0
00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.909
So say that this is 10th
percentile.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/773-0
00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:40.739
This is 20th percentile.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/793-0
00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:43.893
This is 30th percentile and so
on and this will be the 100

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/793-1
00:03:43.893 --> 00:03:44.479
percentile.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/798-0
00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:46.779
100 percentile is maximum is
100.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/808-0
00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:49.569
So now we have got something to
plot right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/823-0
00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:54.689
So I can plot saying that for 10
I'm going to put this at 20.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/845-0
00:03:56.539 --> 00:04:03.889
Then 25 uh for 2030405060708090
hundred.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/869-0
00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:11.332
So so now I can observe this and
I can say something that that is

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/869-1
00:04:11.332 --> 00:04:13.769
the way it is changing.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/875-0
00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.779
I can represent this as, have I
clarified.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/879-0
00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:19.479
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/883-0
00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:19.929
Yes, Sir.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/896-0
00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:21.729
But but why is it we have to
take?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/927-0
00:04:22.059 --> 00:04:25.141
I mean, my question might be
silly, but on X axis, why is

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/927-1
00:04:25.141 --> 00:04:27.319
that we have to showcase the
percentile?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/939-0
00:04:27.929 --> 00:04:30.114
Because there is nothing else
now, there is only one

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/939-1
00:04:30.114 --> 00:04:30.979
observation you made.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/954-0
00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:34.810
So it is the same onion that you
observed all in the 10 grocery

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/954-1
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:35.219
stores.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/968-0
00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:38.709
So so there is nothing to plot
in the X axis, right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/971-0
00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:40.719
OK, OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/974-0
00:04:42.329 --> 00:04:42.659
Sure.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/986-0
00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:42.979
Thank you.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/978-0
00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:43.259
So.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/988-0
00:04:43.269 --> 00:04:44.619
So no, you think about this.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1004-0
00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:48.076
This also gives you the type of
variation that is there in the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1004-1
00:04:48.076 --> 00:04:48.459
school.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1022-0
00:04:48.829 --> 00:04:51.828
For example, you got in the
examination scores and you don't

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1022-1
00:04:51.828 --> 00:04:52.959
know the student names.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1029-0
00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:54.619
All you know is the examination
school.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1055-0
00:04:54.929 --> 00:04:58.709
Since then, what you can say is
that OK, 100 percentile is

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1055-1
00:04:58.709 --> 00:05:01.849
something 9595 because that is
the maximum mark.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1074-0
00:05:02.269 --> 00:05:05.530
So then you can stay that if I
look at 75 percentile I'm

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1074-1
00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:06.159
getting 70.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1090-0
00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:09.909
So that means that 75% of the
students got less than 70.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1117-0
00:05:10.829 --> 00:05:13.722
So now now you are not plotting
against the student names, you

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1117-1
00:05:13.722 --> 00:05:15.789
are plotting it against the
percentile rank.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1127-0
00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:17.859
Mr Srinivas, that's clear.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1151-0
00:05:18.109 --> 00:05:21.208
This you may have observed many
times because the scores

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1136-0
00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:19.079
Yeah, yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1151-1
00:05:21.208 --> 00:05:24.579
anonymous scores, you can only
analyze using the percentiles.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1153-0
00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:26.299
Makes sense.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1155-0
00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:26.699
Thank you.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1174-0
00:05:29.869 --> 00:05:34.607
Alright, let's get started with
the new topic is data similarity

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1174-1
00:05:34.607 --> 00:05:35.919
and dissimilarity.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1176-0
00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:37.079
So.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1208-0
00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:42.024
So what we have seen is that
many times our biggest intent is

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1208-1
00:05:42.024 --> 00:05:47.155
that we are looking at the data
and our intent is to create some

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1208-2
00:05:47.155 --> 00:05:48.339
discrimination.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1220-0
00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:50.379
Obviously what we want to do is
a discrimination.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1231-0
00:05:50.609 --> 00:05:52.859
For example, we have taken one
example.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1274-0
00:05:52.869 --> 00:05:56.321
I think in the first session
about how do the poll experts

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1274-1
00:05:56.321 --> 00:06:00.007
there are there are many data
scientists who are sitting there

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1274-2
00:06:00.007 --> 00:06:03.049
with 100 research agencies that
are there in India.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1306-0
00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:05.945
So they're going to take a lot
of data and they're going to

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1306-1
00:06:05.945 --> 00:06:08.555
predict that party X is going to
win the election or party is

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1306-2
00:06:08.555 --> 00:06:09.649
going to win the election.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1325-0
00:06:10.059 --> 00:06:13.664
So now the question is that what
is the discrimination that they

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1325-1
00:06:13.664 --> 00:06:14.329
are getting?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1383-0
00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:18.138
So to say that one person is
likely to vote for party X or

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1383-1
00:06:18.138 --> 00:06:22.103
one person is likely to vote for
party because the point is that

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1383-2
00:06:22.103 --> 00:06:25.945
what they have now got is they
have got some sample data which

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1383-3
00:06:25.945 --> 00:06:29.483
may be much, much smaller than
actual population, and the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1383-4
00:06:29.483 --> 00:06:31.679
sample may also not be
trustworthy.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1451-0
00:06:32.149 --> 00:06:36.427
So in spite of that, they need
to create a discrimination

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1451-1
00:06:36.427 --> 00:06:41.000
saying that, yes, if there are
employees with the salary less

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1451-2
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.131
than ₹25,000 and they're all
likely to vote for certain

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1451-3
00:06:45.131 --> 00:06:49.483
candidate, and if there are,
there are, let's say, tobacco

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1451-4
00:06:49.483 --> 00:06:53.761
workers, they are likely to
support somebody because that

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1451-5
00:06:53.761 --> 00:06:56.269
that person only fights for
them.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1466-0
00:06:56.539 --> 00:07:00.891
So now you have creating a
discrimination based on certain

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1466-1
00:07:00.891 --> 00:07:01.629
attribute.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1490-0
00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:05.005
So now the question is that
finally in data science you need

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1490-1
00:07:05.005 --> 00:07:07.709
to create the discriminative
model, that is the.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1498-0
00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:08.949
That is what is going to
predict.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1529-0
00:07:09.359 --> 00:07:12.979
For example, if you if you have
brought in a fancy gadget and

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1529-1
00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:16.599
into the market and you want to
know who is likely to buy it.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1539-0
00:07:17.379 --> 00:07:20.069
Finally, it depends on the your
ability to discriminate.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1602-0
00:07:20.079 --> 00:07:23.013
You have the customer
demographics or customer

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1602-1
00:07:23.013 --> 00:07:26.820
profiles, so possibly you have
or you hide a market research

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1602-2
00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:30.815
agency or somebody they have got
the customer details including

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1602-3
00:07:30.815 --> 00:07:34.623
many attributes but then but
then if you want to see what is

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1602-4
00:07:34.623 --> 00:07:38.430
the market size that you have
for for your fancy gadget, you

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1602-5
00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:41.239
need the ability to discriminate
among them.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1632-0
00:07:41.249 --> 00:07:45.021
Saying that, OK, if the person's
employee a a person's income is

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1632-1
00:07:45.021 --> 00:07:48.619
more than 20,00,000 and he's in
the age bracket of 25 and 30.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1651-0
00:07:48.909 --> 00:07:52.841
Yeah, that person will go after
my gadget because that is what

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1651-1
00:07:52.841 --> 00:07:54.339
you think is your model.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1676-0
00:07:54.629 --> 00:07:57.367
So so the so essentially you
created a discrimination saying

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1676-1
00:07:57.367 --> 00:08:00.150
that these are the people who
are of different types than the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1676-2
00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:00.419
other.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1758-0
00:08:00.809 --> 00:08:04.154
So essentially, the
discrimination means one of the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1758-1
00:08:04.154 --> 00:08:08.272
very important criteria based on
which you understand the data,

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1758-2
00:08:08.272 --> 00:08:12.325
saying that this data I want to
group this way and that data I

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1758-3
00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:16.378
want to group that way and most
of the time the discrimination

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1758-4
00:08:16.378 --> 00:08:20.559
comes through what what we know
as a what we refer as a major of

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1758-5
00:08:20.559 --> 00:08:24.483
proximity, all the major of
distance and both of them are in

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1758-6
00:08:24.483 --> 00:08:26.349
proximity is how close it is.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1770-0
00:08:26.799 --> 00:08:29.389
Distance is how distant it is,
so it is the same thing.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1789-0
00:08:29.689 --> 00:08:33.387
So so this is sometimes referred
as what is similarity and what

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1789-1
00:08:33.387 --> 00:08:34.369
is dissimilarity.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1805-0
00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:38.835
Thereby you start creating the
isolation among the data data

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1805-1
00:08:38.835 --> 00:08:41.449
elements that are there in your
data set.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1841-0
00:08:45.939 --> 00:08:49.422
And now we have already talked
about that the attributes, when

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1841-1
00:08:49.422 --> 00:08:52.739
we look at the attributes in
data science, we don't look at

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1841-2
00:08:52.739 --> 00:08:54.729
them like a database
administrator.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1851-0
00:08:55.019 --> 00:08:58.179
Database administrator may check
which attribute size is 10.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1871-0
00:08:58.829 --> 00:09:01.899
And I yeah, didn't characters
and which is 100 characters?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1877-0
00:09:02.109 --> 00:09:04.239
Can I create an index on very
large field?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1915-0
00:09:04.249 --> 00:09:10.208
Can I create an index on numeric
field or a categorical or a text

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1915-1
00:09:10.208 --> 00:09:15.174
field so they they think in
terms of the size and then

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1915-2
00:09:15.174 --> 00:09:16.619
format etcetera.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1928-0
00:09:16.969 --> 00:09:20.099
But then the data scientists
will think in terms of is the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1928-1
00:09:20.099 --> 00:09:20.629
attribute.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1937-0
00:09:23.149 --> 00:09:24.589
Is that tribute nominal?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1949-0
00:09:24.639 --> 00:09:27.499
We have already seen these this
in the previous classes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1952-0
00:09:27.889 --> 00:09:29.099
Or is it ordinal?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1979-0
00:09:31.069 --> 00:09:35.870
Or or it can be the nominal can
be specialization of the nominal

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1979-1
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:38.529
is binary and also the ordinary
is.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1988-0
00:09:38.539 --> 00:09:40.159
Also, specialization of nomina.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/1993-0
00:09:40.549 --> 00:09:42.129
So then is it numeric?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2012-0
00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:49.012
And can I divide or only add up
or or compute the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2012-1
00:09:49.012 --> 00:09:50.309
differentiation?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2016-0
00:09:50.639 --> 00:09:52.339
So is it interval?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2029-0
00:09:53.919 --> 00:09:58.079
Scaling is only interval scaling
or ratio scaling.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2053-0
00:10:00.999 --> 00:10:05.086
So, so the and then you can have
a similarity measure and we'll

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2053-1
00:10:05.086 --> 00:10:07.449
come to the similarity measure
also.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2074-0
00:10:07.849 --> 00:10:14.112
So so now now the point is that
similarity and dissimilarity we

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2074-1
00:10:14.112 --> 00:10:16.559
can measure in any range.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2099-0
00:10:17.079 --> 00:10:22.819
For example, you can measure the
distance between the the what is

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2099-1
00:10:22.819 --> 00:10:27.341
our Galaxy Milky Way to
Andromeda in what units you

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2099-2
00:10:27.341 --> 00:10:28.559
measure, lady?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2125-0
00:10:28.569 --> 00:10:33.231
It's right and the distance
between uh, between, say,

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2125-1
00:10:33.231 --> 00:10:38.496
Hyderabad and Delhi, you are
going to measure it in possibly

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2125-2
00:10:38.496 --> 00:10:40.309
kilometers and miles.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2143-0
00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:43.949
So the units don't matter, so
you can measure it in any units.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2163-0
00:10:44.239 --> 00:10:48.796
And now the question is that the
units don't matter, but what

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2163-1
00:10:48.796 --> 00:10:51.369
matters then we look at one
thing.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2176-0
00:10:51.559 --> 00:10:56.134
So how many numbers are there
between, let's say one to

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2176-1
00:10:56.134 --> 00:10:56.869
Infinity?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2183-0
00:10:59.069 --> 00:10:59.949
How many numbers are there?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2196-0
00:11:04.329 --> 00:11:04.769
Infinity.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2200-0
00:11:05.399 --> 00:11:05.869
Infinite.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2202-0
00:11:05.659 --> 00:11:06.389
80 -, 1.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2208-0
00:11:05.859 --> 00:11:07.339
Day Infinity.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2206-0
00:11:05.879 --> 00:11:07.889
Absolutely, absolutely.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2211-0
00:11:07.999 --> 00:11:09.409
Infinity minus one is called.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2214-0
00:11:09.419 --> 00:11:10.149
OK, good.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2226-0
00:11:10.239 --> 00:11:12.949
So now, how many numbers are
there between zero and one?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2239-0
00:11:17.779 --> 00:11:18.259
Non 0.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2247-0
00:11:17.819 --> 00:11:18.869
This will pass Infinity.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2246-0
00:11:18.539 --> 00:11:18.699
Right.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2242-0
00:11:19.539 --> 00:11:20.019
Infinity.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2244-0
00:11:20.029 --> 00:11:20.229
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2248-0
00:11:20.239 --> 00:11:20.429
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2276-0
00:11:20.439 --> 00:11:25.566
OK, so it doesn't matter whether
you are going to take one to

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2276-1
00:11:25.566 --> 00:11:30.279
Infinity as your scale or 0 to
one as your scale, right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2282-0
00:11:30.859 --> 00:11:31.819
So we have.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2316-0
00:11:31.869 --> 00:11:35.208
So the point is that we talk
about one thing we talk about

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2316-1
00:11:35.208 --> 00:11:38.886
when we measure the distance is
like we talked about is it light

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2316-2
00:11:38.886 --> 00:11:41.319
years or is it kilometers or is
it meters?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2340-0
00:11:41.749 --> 00:11:45.417
So the units, they make a
difference, but then we are

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2340-1
00:11:45.417 --> 00:11:49.220
talking about we are focusing in
data science mostly on

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2340-2
00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:50.239
discrimination.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2348-0
00:11:53.469 --> 00:11:55.179
So that we can make a
prediction.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2398-0
00:11:59.399 --> 00:12:03.781
All or we can create a clusters
which are which are again based

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2398-1
00:12:03.781 --> 00:12:08.163
on another discrimination which
is similarity and dissimilarity

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2398-2
00:12:08.163 --> 00:12:12.271
which is which is saying that
what should stay together and

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2398-3
00:12:12.271 --> 00:12:16.379
what should be treated as a as a
different type of element.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2409-0
00:12:16.879 --> 00:12:19.209
Again, we are doing it based on
the data values.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2437-0
00:12:19.479 --> 00:12:24.058
So in all these cases, what we
need is really discrimination

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2437-1
00:12:24.058 --> 00:12:29.013
and zero to 1 provides as good a
discrimination as minus Infinity

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2437-2
00:12:29.013 --> 00:12:30.289
to plus Infinity.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2456-0
00:12:34.919 --> 00:12:38.841
Because in both cases we have
seen them equal numbers, we are

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2456-1
00:12:38.841 --> 00:12:40.549
talking about real numbers.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2464-0
00:12:45.989 --> 00:12:46.889
They are funny, right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2481-0
00:12:47.119 --> 00:12:51.211
So so the range don't matter,
you can the discrimination

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2481-1
00:12:51.211 --> 00:12:52.359
matters and all.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2493-0
00:12:52.369 --> 00:12:55.676
All that you are interested in
is discrimination and not real

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2493-1
00:12:55.676 --> 00:12:56.049
values.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2500-0
00:12:56.899 --> 00:12:57.929
Because, uh, you.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2531-0
00:12:57.939 --> 00:13:02.226
If you try to express a distance
between Kanyakumari to Kashmir

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2531-1
00:13:02.226 --> 00:13:05.642
in light years, so it will be
very inconvenient to

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2531-2
00:13:05.642 --> 00:13:07.249
inconvenient to measure.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2549-0
00:13:07.519 --> 00:13:11.023
So for sake of convenience, we
try to measure it in either

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2549-1
00:13:11.023 --> 00:13:13.339
kilometers or miles, but nothing
more.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2553-0
00:13:14.189 --> 00:13:15.499
So why not?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2558-0
00:13:15.859 --> 00:13:16.499
Why not?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2571-0
00:13:16.509 --> 00:13:20.279
We go for a range because most
of the time we won't be.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2586-0
00:13:20.289 --> 00:13:23.271
Discrimination has to be done by
the machine, so it doesn't

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2586-1
00:13:23.271 --> 00:13:23.619
matter.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2601-0
00:13:23.709 --> 00:13:26.739
So 0 to one is going to be
helpful in certain ways.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2606-0
00:13:26.749 --> 00:13:27.439
I mean, it's not.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2621-0
00:13:27.449 --> 00:13:30.279
I'm not going to say that it has
to be 0 to one.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2642-0
00:13:30.289 --> 00:13:33.327
It can very well be some if
somebody demands 0 to 5 should

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2642-1
00:13:33.327 --> 00:13:34.099
be their range.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2645-0
00:13:34.849 --> 00:13:35.589
That is pretty good.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2647-0
00:13:36.569 --> 00:13:37.119
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2665-0
00:13:37.209 --> 00:13:41.016
And and then the dissimilarity
and similarity, we almost

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2665-1
00:13:41.016 --> 00:13:43.019
majority using the same units.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2696-0
00:13:43.379 --> 00:13:47.471
OK, so so The thing is that
there are dissimilarities

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2696-1
00:13:47.471 --> 00:13:52.170
indicating exactly opposite of
what is similarity alright and

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2696-2
00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:54.519
the proximity we refer to both.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2713-0
00:13:54.559 --> 00:13:58.208
I mean, sometimes similarity and
sometimes just and this is the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2713-1
00:13:58.208 --> 00:13:58.949
data metrics.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2738-0
00:13:59.139 --> 00:14:02.169
So if you if you are very
familiar with the relational

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2738-1
00:14:02.169 --> 00:14:05.199
model, So what we are saying is
that this is a record.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2742-0
00:14:08.049 --> 00:14:08.689
Or it tuple.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2748-0
00:14:10.489 --> 00:14:12.449
And this is a relation.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2750-0
00:14:14.409 --> 00:14:14.749
Table.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2759-0
00:14:16.449 --> 00:14:18.229
Dataset, whatever you call it.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2769-0
00:14:20.789 --> 00:14:24.279
And each one of them each and
attribute.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2787-0
00:14:26.869 --> 00:14:30.246
So there are P attributes so
that same attributes are also

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2787-1
00:14:30.246 --> 00:14:32.249
referred many times as
dimensions.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2818-0
00:14:36.009 --> 00:14:40.284
So we have P dimensions and we
have no records or N tuples N

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2818-1
00:14:40.284 --> 00:14:44.489
data points, some some people
refer to them as data points.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2824-0
00:14:44.499 --> 00:14:46.679
Some people refer to them as
data objects.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2830-0
00:14:49.359 --> 00:14:49.809
Part of it.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2840-0
00:14:50.089 --> 00:14:53.689
And now, now we want to compute
the distance between them.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2860-0
00:14:54.039 --> 00:14:58.888
So there are yen N objects, so
we want to find the distance

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2860-1
00:14:58.888 --> 00:15:00.989
between these yen objects.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2882-0
00:15:00.999 --> 00:15:04.465
So you can treat them as yen
employees in your organization

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2882-1
00:15:04.465 --> 00:15:06.949
and for each employee you are
storing 100.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2931-0
00:15:07.459 --> 00:15:12.174
Ohh 100 data points so data
points can include age and where

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2931-1
00:15:12.174 --> 00:15:16.271
the person has studied
matriculation and what is the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2931-2
00:15:16.271 --> 00:15:21.063
native place and what is the
father's name and what is the as

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2931-3
00:15:21.063 --> 00:15:22.609
many type of things.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2937-0
00:15:22.619 --> 00:15:23.929
So gender, what is the gender?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2942-0
00:15:23.939 --> 00:15:24.919
What is the rank?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2947-0
00:15:24.929 --> 00:15:26.429
What is the education?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2954-0
00:15:26.439 --> 00:15:27.769
What is the certification rank?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2959-0
00:15:27.779 --> 00:15:28.579
All kinds of things.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2980-0
00:15:29.519 --> 00:15:32.891
So so now the question is that
you want to compute the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/2980-1
00:15:32.891 --> 00:15:35.649
difference difference between
one and other.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3002-0
00:15:35.919 --> 00:15:40.091
So you can create a difference
matrix and a difference matrix

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3002-1
00:15:40.091 --> 00:15:43.389
or a distance matrix, or a
dissimilarity matrix.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3020-0
00:15:43.399 --> 00:15:47.018
This can as well be a
similarity, so that is going to

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3020-1
00:15:47.018 --> 00:15:47.889
be symmetric.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3042-0
00:15:47.899 --> 00:15:59.769
So saying that B21 is equal to
D12, that is DIJ is equal to DJ.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3045-0
00:15:59.839 --> 00:16:00.279
Why?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3079-0
00:16:00.659 --> 00:16:06.538
So we have, it is sufficient and
then the diagonal elements for

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3079-1
00:16:06.538 --> 00:16:11.039
distance are all zero because
DII is equal to 0.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3110-0
00:16:11.389 --> 00:16:15.556
So diagonal elements are zero
and then so since D2 and D12 and

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3110-1
00:16:15.556 --> 00:16:19.459
D1 are two are same, we don't
even need to store the rest.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3117-0
00:16:19.889 --> 00:16:22.459
So we can store it as it
triangular matrix.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3162-0
00:16:27.429 --> 00:16:32.313
So now, now we had already said
that from a data scientist

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3162-1
00:16:32.313 --> 00:16:37.694
perspective the attributes take
certain types and let's see when

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3162-2
00:16:37.694 --> 00:16:42.743
when you have an employee, the
employee is going to have all

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3162-3
00:16:42.743 --> 00:16:44.399
types of attributes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3181-0
00:16:44.409 --> 00:16:49.082
For example, you can say the the
what is the mother tongue of the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3181-1
00:16:49.082 --> 00:16:49.719
employee.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3202-0
00:16:49.989 --> 00:16:54.247
So mother tongue in India, you
may get some 2020 languages or

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3202-1
00:16:54.247 --> 00:16:56.719
if you have even foreign
nationals.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3250-0
00:16:56.729 --> 00:17:01.033
So can you make it 100 languages
and now all you say is that the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3250-1
00:17:01.033 --> 00:17:04.411
language of person X is
different from language of

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3250-2
00:17:04.411 --> 00:17:08.715
person Y, so you can't have any
other differentiation and so are

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3250-3
00:17:08.715 --> 00:17:11.099
the OR the color of the eye
people.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3262-0
00:17:11.109 --> 00:17:15.559
Sometimes they they even keep
that for iris purposes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3278-0
00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:19.119
So is it a blue eyed or Black
Eyed or brown eyed or whatever?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3288-0
00:17:19.749 --> 00:17:22.279
So now now you have a situation.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3298-0
00:17:22.289 --> 00:17:25.709
So there are these attributes
are called nominal attributes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3325-0
00:17:26.899 --> 00:17:30.458
These attributes are nominal
attributes, so some of the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3325-1
00:17:30.458 --> 00:17:33.890
attributes that you were data
objects have or nominal

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3325-2
00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:34.589
attributes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3338-0
00:17:34.719 --> 00:17:37.593
So how do we compute the
difference based on nominal

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3338-1
00:17:37.593 --> 00:17:38.189
attributes?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3364-0
00:17:38.539 --> 00:17:42.044
So what we can say is that the
nominal attributes, if they too

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3364-1
00:17:42.044 --> 00:17:44.269
are different, we give a
distance of 1.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3378-0
00:17:44.799 --> 00:17:47.369
If the two are same, we're going
to give a value of 0.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3394-0
00:17:47.759 --> 00:17:53.389
So so now, now there are two
people who owns both have their

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3394-1
00:17:53.389 --> 00:17:54.589
pupils black.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3413-0
00:17:54.759 --> 00:17:57.603
OK, we say the distance is 0
between them with respect to

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3413-1
00:17:57.603 --> 00:17:58.339
that attribute.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3494-0
00:17:58.949 --> 00:18:02.475
Now, now what is the value that
we'll keep it aside because the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3494-1
00:18:02.475 --> 00:18:05.671
the product may have, for
example, we took the employees,

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3494-2
00:18:05.671 --> 00:18:09.087
but there may be product and the
products can have many, many

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3494-3
00:18:09.087 --> 00:18:12.007
features and maybe you are
working for an automobile

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3494-4
00:18:12.007 --> 00:18:15.147
company and each car model has
got certain features with

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3494-5
00:18:15.147 --> 00:18:18.453
respect to a compact or the
other end, then that makes some

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3494-6
00:18:18.453 --> 00:18:21.979
of those some of those features
are going to make a difference.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3523-0
00:18:23.429 --> 00:18:28.673
So suppose that instead of 1,
there are P nominal attributes

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3523-1
00:18:28.673 --> 00:18:33.315
and out of them Yammer are
matching and P -, M or not

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3523-2
00:18:33.315 --> 00:18:34.089
matching.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3530-0
00:18:39.489 --> 00:18:40.829
So it is very simple.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3552-0
00:18:41.009 --> 00:18:46.499
So the distance we will say is
that based on P attributes with

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3552-1
00:18:46.499 --> 00:18:47.719
young matches.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3571-0
00:18:47.929 --> 00:18:52.654
So we'll see the distance is P
-, M by P This can take a value

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3571-1
00:18:52.654 --> 00:18:53.779
from zero to 1.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3581-0
00:18:59.029 --> 00:19:01.269
So now let us forget about
everything.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3612-0
00:19:01.279 --> 00:19:05.313
Let's say color is the only
criteria you are using to

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3612-1
00:19:05.313 --> 00:19:09.870
differentiate the object 1234
and we are creating a distance

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3612-2
00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:11.439
matrix based on this.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3644-0
00:19:12.489 --> 00:19:16.826
So now what are what are we
getting the distance between one

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3644-1
00:19:16.826 --> 00:19:21.519
to one is 01 to two is 1, one to
three is 1 and one to four each.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3652-0
00:19:22.119 --> 00:19:22.879
That's simple as that.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3666-0
00:19:22.889 --> 00:19:25.098
And the rest of the things that
we can fill up using the same

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3666-1
00:19:25.098 --> 00:19:25.419
criteria.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3679-0
00:19:28.589 --> 00:19:32.269
And same thing can be computed
using a distance matrix.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3688-0
00:19:37.569 --> 00:19:38.019
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3699-0
00:19:37.639 --> 00:19:40.369
So how did you get this matrix
value?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3693-0
00:19:39.749 --> 00:19:40.149
Yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3700-0
00:19:40.159 --> 00:19:41.759
Yes, just just one minute.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3702-0
00:19:41.819 --> 00:19:42.359
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3713-0
00:19:42.549 --> 00:19:46.039
OK, then yes, one, one person
has raised a question.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3728-0
00:19:48.199 --> 00:19:48.869
Uh, can you?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3726-0
00:19:48.249 --> 00:19:48.509
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3754-0
00:19:48.519 --> 00:19:51.767
In the previous slide, how in
the previous slide, how did you

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3740-0
00:19:48.879 --> 00:19:49.699
Can you repeat the question?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3754-1
00:19:51.767 --> 00:19:52.919
get the matrix solved?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3759-0
00:19:53.929 --> 00:19:55.679
How did I get the matrix OK?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3763-0
00:19:55.749 --> 00:19:56.579
OK, alright.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3767-0
00:19:56.699 --> 00:19:57.729
Let me let me go back.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3793-0
00:19:59.449 --> 00:20:03.015
So the metrics is, uh, you're
talking about the metrics on the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3793-1
00:20:03.015 --> 00:20:05.279
right or the metrics table on
the left?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3791-0
00:20:06.119 --> 00:20:06.469
Right.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3807-0
00:20:06.479 --> 00:20:07.739
One this is equal to.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3800-0
00:20:07.509 --> 00:20:08.029
Right now.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3812-0
00:20:07.799 --> 00:20:08.839
OK, very fine.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3803-0
00:20:08.039 --> 00:20:08.379
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3815-0
00:20:08.849 --> 00:20:09.449
Fine, fine.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3824-0
00:20:09.489 --> 00:20:11.439
OK, very simple actually it is
very simple.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3833-0
00:20:11.769 --> 00:20:14.959
So how am I getting the this is
representing?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3870-0
00:20:19.859 --> 00:20:23.659
This is representing the
distance between one and two,

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3870-1
00:20:23.659 --> 00:20:27.528
and this is representing
distance between 3:00 and 4:00

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3870-2
00:20:27.528 --> 00:20:31.259
and you can see that each object
has got a key value.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3886-0
00:20:31.269 --> 00:20:34.499
So it is easy to identify what
is 3 and what is 4 right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3908-0
00:20:35.109 --> 00:20:39.694
So distance between three and
four is 1 because the color is

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3908-1
00:20:39.694 --> 00:20:42.249
green for three and red for
four.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3910-0
00:20:43.619 --> 00:20:44.109
Is that fine?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3925-0
00:20:48.809 --> 00:20:51.519
Is that fine or or am I am I?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3933-0
00:20:51.589 --> 00:20:54.009
Am I out of sync with you?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3978-0
00:20:54.769 --> 00:20:58.789
So R signing some weights to the
color, I mean, how?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3940-0
00:20:55.259 --> 00:20:55.439
You.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4065-0
00:20:58.199 --> 00:20:59.969
You have a hello.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3987-0
00:20:58.239 --> 00:21:01.079
Yeah, I'm not understanding how
can tell us can become numbers.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3968-0
00:20:58.299 --> 00:20:59.309
No, no, there is no need.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3983-0
00:20:59.319 --> 00:20:59.929
No, no, no.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/3991-0
00:20:59.939 --> 00:21:03.289
Mr Mr MEHAR, Mr Mr.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4010-0
00:21:03.299 --> 00:21:06.206
Chairman, I think he Mr MEHAR
Charan, you're asking no

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4010-1
00:21:06.206 --> 00:21:06.629
problem.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4021-0
00:21:06.229 --> 00:21:06.459
Yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4017-0
00:21:06.639 --> 00:21:08.109
We can assign the weight, but
why?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4024-0
00:21:08.119 --> 00:21:08.859
Why go to the weight?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4028-0
00:21:08.869 --> 00:21:09.009
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4042-0
00:21:09.019 --> 00:21:11.229
We will go to the wait a little
later, right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4053-0
00:21:11.279 --> 00:21:11.939
If we think that.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4047-0
00:21:11.289 --> 00:21:11.859
No, no, no.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4063-0
00:21:11.869 --> 00:21:16.849
I I just want to understand how
we considering red or green into

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4063-1
00:21:16.849 --> 00:21:17.539
distance.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4086-0
00:21:17.829 --> 00:21:18.729
I mean in in numerical.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4098-0
00:21:18.079 --> 00:21:21.186
Yeah, because red and see see Mr
MEHAR Charan all we are saying

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4076-0
00:21:18.089 --> 00:21:18.719
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4092-0
00:21:18.759 --> 00:21:19.539
Yeah, right. Right.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4098-1
00:21:21.186 --> 00:21:22.399
is that red is different.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4102-0
00:21:22.409 --> 00:21:23.439
Green is different.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4120-0
00:21:23.529 --> 00:21:25.731
We are not saying green is
superior to red or red is

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4120-1
00:21:25.731 --> 00:21:26.479
superior to green.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4140-0
00:21:26.689 --> 00:21:29.488
All we are saying is that one
object has a red and one object

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4140-1
00:21:29.488 --> 00:21:29.759
green.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4170-0
00:21:29.769 --> 00:21:32.729
So we say distance is one with
respect to the color, yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4184-0
00:21:30.309 --> 00:21:33.478
Well, I I understand I have to
support if it's a if it's a red

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4184-1
00:21:33.478 --> 00:21:35.289
and red, so the distance will be
0.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4182-0
00:21:35.679 --> 00:21:37.099
Geeta, absolutely that is right.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4210-0
00:21:37.109 --> 00:21:39.918
That is what happened with the
object one and four, because

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4210-1
00:21:39.918 --> 00:21:42.259
both of them are red color, we
set the object is.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4209-0
00:21:40.149 --> 00:21:40.789
OK, I understand.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4218-0
00:21:42.269 --> 00:21:43.449
Here is that clear.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4224-0
00:21:43.459 --> 00:21:46.509
So Miss Shamshad and Mr Charan?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4222-0
00:21:43.479 --> 00:21:43.619
And.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4230-0
00:21:47.809 --> 00:21:48.029
Hello.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4236-0
00:21:48.659 --> 00:21:49.629
Yes, yes, it's good.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4237-0
00:21:50.179 --> 00:21:50.769
It is clear.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4241-0
00:21:50.779 --> 00:21:52.069
OK, OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4250-0
00:21:51.779 --> 00:21:51.939
Hello.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4263-0
00:21:52.079 --> 00:21:53.979
So, Mr Pranav, you have a
question, yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4259-0
00:21:54.079 --> 00:21:54.929
Yes, Sir.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4294-0
00:21:54.939 --> 00:21:58.503
How are we categorizing
categorical value in like like

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4294-1
00:21:58.503 --> 00:22:02.521
we have only two colors green
and red but what we have 8 type

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4294-2
00:22:02.521 --> 00:22:03.169
of colors.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4314-0
00:22:03.179 --> 00:22:06.089
So how is as the numbers?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4332-0
00:22:04.199 --> 00:22:07.386
Well, because, see, The thing is
that the categorical by

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4332-1
00:22:07.386 --> 00:22:10.516
definition is such that we
cannot put a hierarchy or we

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4332-2
00:22:10.516 --> 00:22:12.529
cannot put any where anything
else.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4398-0
00:22:12.739 --> 00:22:16.357
All we can say is that we can
say that they are same or

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4398-1
00:22:16.357 --> 00:22:20.622
they're different and one of the
ways that we represent is that I

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4398-2
00:22:20.622 --> 00:22:24.563
hope you are present in the
webinar is A1 hot encoding where

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4398-3
00:22:24.563 --> 00:22:28.569
we are forced to create many
binary variables and then do it.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4396-0
00:22:26.289 --> 00:22:26.909
Text me.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4404-0
00:22:28.579 --> 00:22:29.569
That is an alternate way.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4409-0
00:22:29.579 --> 00:22:30.619
Let's not get into that.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4427-0
00:22:31.039 --> 00:22:35.211
So we don't have any other basis
to differentiate them, is that

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4427-1
00:22:35.211 --> 00:22:36.189
fine, Mr Prena?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4430-0
00:22:37.799 --> 00:22:37.979
Yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4436-0
00:22:39.539 --> 00:22:41.709
The first column I understand,
Sir.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4447-0
00:22:41.719 --> 00:22:44.049
But what about the second and
third column?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4470-0
00:22:44.419 --> 00:22:45.679
How we are deriving that?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4457-0
00:22:44.539 --> 00:22:45.529
It is identical.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4464-0
00:22:45.579 --> 00:22:46.269
It is identical.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4478-0
00:22:46.279 --> 00:22:49.099
Think about it the same way
second and third column.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4487-0
00:22:49.109 --> 00:22:51.809
Second column is talking about
distance between three and two.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4491-0
00:22:51.869 --> 00:22:52.569
Think about that.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4496-0
00:22:52.579 --> 00:22:52.979
Look at that.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4511-0
00:22:53.989 --> 00:22:57.019
I hope you are able to read that
distance between three and two.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4521-0
00:22:58.129 --> 00:23:01.719
It is same right same way we
compute the same way.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4548-0
00:23:05.099 --> 00:23:05.999
For each action.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4542-0
00:23:05.409 --> 00:23:06.779
I miss you, miss you to be.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4545-0
00:23:06.789 --> 00:23:07.299
Is it right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4551-0
00:23:07.349 --> 00:23:07.709
Is it fine?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4570-0
00:23:09.189 --> 00:23:14.309
Umm, sorry Sir, I'm not getting
how how that that distance.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4567-0
00:23:12.179 --> 00:23:12.539
No, no.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4572-0
00:23:14.319 --> 00:23:15.449
I'm the first.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4582-0
00:23:15.499 --> 00:23:18.389
Uh, the first column I am
getting that.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4588-0
00:23:18.399 --> 00:23:19.459
What's the distance between?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4592-0
00:23:19.469 --> 00:23:20.469
Because there is color.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4596-0
00:23:20.819 --> 00:23:21.169
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4621-0
00:23:21.179 --> 00:23:23.409
So that's is fine that how we
are deriving 0.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4612-0
00:23:22.219 --> 00:23:23.129
No, no, no.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4616-0
00:23:23.139 --> 00:23:23.499
We are.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4624-0
00:23:23.509 --> 00:23:25.209
We are seeing the second column
also.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4662-0
00:23:25.219 --> 00:23:28.041
It is the distance between the
color, but then in the second

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4662-1
00:23:28.041 --> 00:23:30.678
column what we are saying is
that it is distance between

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4662-2
00:23:30.678 --> 00:23:33.315
three and two which is capped,
not captured in the first

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4662-3
00:23:33.315 --> 00:23:33.639
column.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4713-0
00:23:34.349 --> 00:23:37.899
First column only measures the
distance with respect to one

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4713-1
00:23:37.899 --> 00:23:41.330
and, but then in that case we
don't get the distance with

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4713-2
00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:44.880
respect to two because the
distance between with respect to

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4713-3
00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:48.193
two we we have a distance
between two and three that we

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4713-4
00:23:48.193 --> 00:23:50.619
are going to represent using
using this.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4733-0
00:23:53.379 --> 00:23:56.080
Distance between two and three
is represented using this

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4733-1
00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:58.639
distance between three and four
is represented using.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4742-0
00:23:58.649 --> 00:24:00.409
This is that fine Missouri now.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4744-0
00:24:02.409 --> 00:24:02.549
Yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4746-0
00:24:03.849 --> 00:24:04.299
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4750-0
00:24:04.309 --> 00:24:04.779
Thank you.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4756-0
00:24:04.349 --> 00:24:04.689
Umm.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4760-0
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:06.179
OK, there is some other
question.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4783-0
00:24:06.709 --> 00:24:11.635
Yeah, for each attribute of the
data data set we we we need to

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4783-1
00:24:11.635 --> 00:24:14.919
means this matrix can be
generated right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4790-0
00:24:15.629 --> 00:24:17.539
Yes, we can generate if we wish.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4792-0
00:24:17.549 --> 00:24:17.859
Wish.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4794-0
00:24:17.869 --> 00:24:18.329
Yeah, right.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4822-0
00:24:21.569 --> 00:24:25.116
It's just you try to understand
what we are doing and we are

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4822-1
00:24:25.116 --> 00:24:28.430
going going into little more
complicated things as we go

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4822-2
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:28.779
along.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4848-0
00:24:29.689 --> 00:24:34.458
OK, so now now we have a we take
one, we go one step further and

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4848-1
00:24:34.458 --> 00:24:37.539
let us say we want to include
two things.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4857-0
00:24:37.889 --> 00:24:40.079
One is color and other is
position.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4867-0
00:24:40.089 --> 00:24:42.579
Position can be, let's say left,
right, center.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4885-0
00:24:42.909 --> 00:24:47.569
So that is representing possibly
some device way which can take

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4885-1
00:24:47.569 --> 00:24:49.899
its position in any of the ways.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4897-0
00:24:50.289 --> 00:24:53.759
So now we include that two
attributes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4901-0
00:24:54.109 --> 00:24:55.329
So P is equal to 2.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4908-0
00:24:57.189 --> 00:24:59.269
So P is equal to 2.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4921-0
00:25:00.999 --> 00:25:05.109
And then we are checking the
what is the similarity?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4950-0
00:25:05.419 --> 00:25:08.392
So now actually we have taken 6
objects, so we are going to

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4950-1
00:25:08.392 --> 00:25:10.819
create a triangular matrix which
is larger size.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4960-0
00:25:11.359 --> 00:25:15.309
So again, we are using the same
logic to compute the distance.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4970-0
00:25:18.659 --> 00:25:20.869
And the distance between two and
one.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4976-0
00:25:20.919 --> 00:25:21.749
What is happening?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4988-0
00:25:22.139 --> 00:25:24.309
This is R R&amp;B are different.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/4996-0
00:25:24.319 --> 00:25:26.189
LNC are different, so both are
different.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5031-0
00:25:26.679 --> 00:25:36.254
So matches are zero between
matches between one and 2R0, and

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5031-1
00:25:36.254 --> 00:25:43.789
So what we are getting D21 is so
D2D12 and D21.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5045-0
00:25:43.799 --> 00:25:48.329
Same is equal to 2 -, 0 by two
that is equal to 1.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5071-0
00:25:50.099 --> 00:25:54.107
So we are going to fill up the
calculate the same way and we

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5071-1
00:25:54.107 --> 00:25:56.669
are going to get the metrics
same way.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5077-0
00:25:58.449 --> 00:25:59.879
It's just one step further.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5088-0
00:25:59.889 --> 00:26:02.589
I mean, possibly some of you may
have already understood that.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5094-0
00:26:03.349 --> 00:26:04.649
So, so nothing more.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5121-0
00:26:04.659 --> 00:26:07.808
So when we have multiple
attributes, we are going to

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5121-1
00:26:07.808 --> 00:26:11.669
compute the same way and then we
are going to create the method.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5128-0
00:26:11.679 --> 00:26:13.849
So that is about the nominal
attributes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5141-0
00:26:13.959 --> 00:26:15.419
So this is the summary.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5143-0
00:26:14.679 --> 00:26:17.189
So how are we deriving M values,
Sir?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5153-0
00:26:17.259 --> 00:26:18.139
Number of mattress.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5154-0
00:26:18.039 --> 00:26:19.409
Yes, yes, just one minute.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5173-0
00:26:21.119 --> 00:26:24.519
Uh, So what is the question,
Miss Gentry?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5186-0
00:26:23.379 --> 00:26:27.359
However, deriving the number of
matches and value.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5182-0
00:26:26.759 --> 00:26:27.629
Number of matches.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5197-0
00:26:27.639 --> 00:26:31.118
Number of matches are straight
away observed, which visually

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5197-1
00:26:31.118 --> 00:26:32.259
observe the matches.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5244-0
00:26:32.769 --> 00:26:35.968
So you can see that between one
and two the matches are zero,

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5244-1
00:26:35.968 --> 00:26:39.166
but between two and three there
is one match right out of the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5244-2
00:26:39.166 --> 00:26:42.107
two we have one match, B&amp;G
are not matching, but the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5244-3
00:26:42.107 --> 00:26:44.119
position is both of them are
centered.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5257-0
00:26:44.129 --> 00:26:47.019
So C&amp;C are matching so we
say match is 1.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5266-0
00:26:47.329 --> 00:26:49.619
So what is happening between two
and three?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5280-0
00:26:49.749 --> 00:26:53.499
We are seeing that we can see
that what are we using.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5282-0
00:26:53.509 --> 00:26:54.759
We are using this.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5295-0
00:26:56.589 --> 00:26:57.669
So this is the.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5298-0
00:26:56.779 --> 00:26:58.769
Because they're so sorry, Ben
Carson.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5318-0
00:26:58.779 --> 00:27:02.662
But I also said that I
understand, but this thing I am

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5318-1
00:27:02.662 --> 00:27:04.639
literally not understanding.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5342-0
00:27:03.249 --> 00:27:06.809
Yeah, I also not understanding
this.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5324-0
00:27:04.649 --> 00:27:05.109
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5332-0
00:27:05.149 --> 00:27:05.309
That.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5355-0
00:27:05.159 --> 00:27:08.702
How that distance and this one
literally I'm not understanding,

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5339-0
00:27:07.329 --> 00:27:07.779
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5347-0
00:27:07.789 --> 00:27:08.519
Same here, Sir.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5383-0
00:27:08.249 --> 00:27:13.129
The the gestural the just want
to tell me understanding.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5355-1
00:27:08.702 --> 00:27:08.979
yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5364-0
00:27:09.009 --> 00:27:10.239
It's it's kind of confusing.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5384-0
00:27:11.459 --> 00:27:13.119
So with the first example,
please again.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5378-0
00:27:13.119 --> 00:27:13.509
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5398-0
00:27:13.519 --> 00:27:16.774
How distance is getting
calculated and how we are doing

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5398-1
00:27:16.774 --> 00:27:18.459
that matching and everything?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5437-0
00:27:18.579 --> 00:27:23.701
Can you just do a calculation
for the smaller one just for

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5403-0
00:27:18.789 --> 00:27:19.129
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5414-0
00:27:23.249 --> 00:27:23.559
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5423-0
00:27:23.569 --> 00:27:24.159
Yeah, why not?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5437-1
00:27:23.701 --> 00:27:24.829
four by four?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5428-0
00:27:24.729 --> 00:27:25.219
Why not?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5443-0
00:27:24.879 --> 00:27:27.009
That that's right, yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5433-0
00:27:25.549 --> 00:27:26.259
Why not?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5440-0
00:27:26.369 --> 00:27:26.829
Why not?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5444-0
00:27:26.839 --> 00:27:28.369
Yeah, OK. Alright.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5470-0
00:27:31.419 --> 00:27:32.929
So, so liquors.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5485-0
00:27:31.759 --> 00:27:34.756
But just wanted to tell me
understanding if you're in line

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5485-1
00:27:34.756 --> 00:27:38.059
two and three, the color is not
matching but other two positions

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5485-2
00:27:38.059 --> 00:27:38.719
are matching.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5505-0
00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:39.919
That's what we are saying,
right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5492-0
00:27:39.189 --> 00:27:39.539
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5494-0
00:27:39.549 --> 00:27:39.719
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5509-0
00:27:39.729 --> 00:27:42.639
So no, no, let me let me let me
do one thing.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5522-0
00:27:42.649 --> 00:27:46.579
So let me let me go and take
this and.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5528-0
00:27:46.649 --> 00:27:48.479
OK, so let I'm not able to.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5538-0
00:27:48.949 --> 00:27:52.479
OK, So what I'm doing is that I
am.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5543-0
00:27:58.369 --> 00:28:01.039
All right, this means.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5551-0
00:28:02.829 --> 00:28:06.669
OK, so I'm going here, OK?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5560-0
00:28:06.819 --> 00:28:10.529
And I'm constructing the same
table here.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5573-0
00:28:10.879 --> 00:28:15.159
So what I will do is you could
draw it with.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5597-0
00:28:16.799 --> 00:28:19.989
Sir, sorry, Sir, if you can, if
you can explain in a new slide.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5603-0
00:28:20.779 --> 00:28:22.009
Yeah, that is what I'm going to
do.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5605-0
00:28:22.019 --> 00:28:22.629
It that is.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5607-0
00:28:22.639 --> 00:28:23.009
What now?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5609-0
00:28:23.019 --> 00:28:23.649
So one.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5613-0
00:28:25.789 --> 00:28:26.319
Two.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5617-0
00:28:26.369 --> 00:28:28.299
OK, I will.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5624-0
00:28:28.369 --> 00:28:29.339
I will do one thing.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5626-0
00:28:29.349 --> 00:28:30.089
I'll I'll.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5643-0
00:28:51.549 --> 00:28:54.469
OK, So what I will do is yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5661-0
00:28:54.569 --> 00:29:01.857
So now I'll I will create a
small table which is which is

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5661-1
00:29:01.857 --> 00:29:03.239
object one.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5685-0
00:29:06.279 --> 00:29:15.279
Object 123 OK, so for that what
I'm saying is that 123 RLB CDC.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5688-0
00:29:23.099 --> 00:29:23.709
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5705-0
00:29:24.019 --> 00:29:28.241
And so now I want to compute
what is the distance between

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5705-1
00:29:28.241 --> 00:29:29.479
each one of them.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5713-0
00:29:32.129 --> 00:29:34.379
So now let me say distance.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5729-0
00:29:34.389 --> 00:29:37.681
Let me first find the matches
between them matches between one

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5729-1
00:29:37.681 --> 00:29:38.099
and two.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5739-0
00:29:38.389 --> 00:29:40.899
So P is equal to two in this
case.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5748-0
00:29:40.909 --> 00:29:43.729
OK, matches between one and two
is 0, right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5769-0
00:29:45.159 --> 00:29:47.159
The how piece to service to
confirm.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5768-0
00:29:46.359 --> 00:29:46.829
How's it?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5782-0
00:29:47.289 --> 00:29:50.546
B is equal to two because there
are two two variables P is equal

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5782-1
00:29:50.546 --> 00:29:51.949
to the number of parameters.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5791-0
00:29:53.299 --> 00:29:54.419
What is L&amp;C, Sir?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5789-0
00:29:53.859 --> 00:29:54.099
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5800-0
00:29:55.299 --> 00:29:56.429
Yeah, I'll.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5804-0
00:29:55.409 --> 00:29:56.999
Number of yell is left.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5820-0
00:29:56.439 --> 00:29:57.789
Are we use colors right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5815-0
00:29:57.049 --> 00:29:58.059
Yell is it is.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5828-0
00:29:58.069 --> 00:30:01.899
It is a nominal variable, so
nominal variable is that.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5837-0
00:30:01.909 --> 00:30:03.659
Suppose you are operating a
device.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5853-0
00:30:03.669 --> 00:30:06.322
The device can be in the
position, left side or right

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5853-1
00:30:06.322 --> 00:30:07.059
side or center.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5895-0
00:30:07.389 --> 00:30:11.357
So you can say YELCHURI or is
representing 3 positions, or you

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5895-1
00:30:11.357 --> 00:30:15.262
can it can be something like or
you placed objects at various

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5895-2
00:30:15.262 --> 00:30:19.419
points in the board that you can
define them either left or right

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5895-3
00:30:19.419 --> 00:30:20.049
or center.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5902-0
00:30:20.109 --> 00:30:20.839
Right or center.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5908-0
00:30:21.429 --> 00:30:23.159
So that is a nominal attributes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5926-0
00:30:23.169 --> 00:30:26.283
You cannot say that left is
superior to right or or center

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5926-1
00:30:26.283 --> 00:30:27.339
is better than left.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5946-0
00:30:27.349 --> 00:30:32.108
So let's say these are nominal
retries or or we can take or I

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5946-1
00:30:32.108 --> 00:30:32.799
can take.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5969-0
00:30:32.949 --> 00:30:37.266
Maybe if I'm confusing you with
this example, so let me let me

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5969-1
00:30:37.266 --> 00:30:39.939
do another example so I'm taking
that.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5980-0
00:30:40.379 --> 00:30:44.496
I'm looking at 2 attributes, one
is language, other is

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/5980-1
00:30:44.496 --> 00:30:45.319
profession.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6002-0
00:30:46.739 --> 00:30:53.653
So in both of them, suppose that
1234, so the language of 1 first

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6002-1
00:30:53.653 --> 00:30:55.539
person is Punjabi.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6022-0
00:30:57.449 --> 00:31:01.310
And the profession is a data
signed and the language of

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6022-1
00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:03.379
person two is let's say Hindi.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6029-0
00:31:05.569 --> 00:31:07.449
And the person is a doctor.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6047-0
00:31:09.299 --> 00:31:15.512
And person three is, let's say
Bengali Bengal and and the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6047-1
00:31:15.512 --> 00:31:17.869
person is is a lawyer.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6058-0
00:31:19.819 --> 00:31:23.039
And the person four, we can say
again Hindi.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6078-0
00:31:25.369 --> 00:31:29.823
Or OK, let me let me put a
little different because now I'm

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6078-1
00:31:29.823 --> 00:31:30.639
losing the.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6092-0
00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:33.829
OK, so let me put this person
also as a doctor, right.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6094-0
00:31:34.119 --> 00:31:34.839
So that helps.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6108-0
00:31:37.089 --> 00:31:40.239
And this person is Hindi and
this person is also a doctor.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6118-0
00:31:40.829 --> 00:31:43.139
So now, now let us compute the
distance.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6124-0
00:31:43.409 --> 00:31:45.459
So how many parameters are
there?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6132-0
00:31:45.649 --> 00:31:47.469
P is equal to two, right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6142-0
00:31:47.629 --> 00:31:50.189
Nobody has a doubt, language and
profession.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6145-0
00:31:49.199 --> 00:31:49.319
Yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6148-0
00:31:50.199 --> 00:31:52.349
There are two attributes and.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6160-0
00:31:52.359 --> 00:31:53.979
Now let us compute the matches.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6164-0
00:31:54.039 --> 00:31:55.879
Matches between one and two.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6173-0
00:31:56.599 --> 00:31:58.159
How many matches are there 0?
Right.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6183-0
00:31:59.439 --> 00:32:01.519
So how many matches are between
one and three?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6182-0
00:32:00.189 --> 00:32:00.319
Yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6192-0
00:32:03.929 --> 00:32:04.999
That is also zero.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6199-0
00:32:05.019 --> 00:32:05.229
0.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6204-0
00:32:05.129 --> 00:32:07.859
So now let us look at the
matches between 2:00 and 3:00.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6214-0
00:32:08.349 --> 00:32:09.249
This is equal to 1.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6215-0
00:32:08.739 --> 00:32:10.439
Said said.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6241-0
00:32:10.639 --> 00:32:14.946
What does it mean that matches
between one and two, which which

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6248-0
00:32:14.139 --> 00:32:16.767
Matches between the language is
not matching and profession is

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6241-1
00:32:14.946 --> 00:32:15.619
attribute?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6248-1
00:32:16.767 --> 00:32:17.309
not matching.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6259-0
00:32:17.799 --> 00:32:20.621
So both of them are not matched,
so the number of matches are

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6259-1
00:32:20.621 --> 00:32:20.849
zero.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6276-0
00:32:21.179 --> 00:32:24.637
So the formula finally we are
going to get is P -, M by P,

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6271-0
00:32:21.609 --> 00:32:21.939
Back.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6276-1
00:32:24.637 --> 00:32:24.989
right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6288-0
00:32:25.479 --> 00:32:27.399
So M is representing the number
of matches.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6285-0
00:32:25.809 --> 00:32:26.289
At.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6298-0
00:32:28.139 --> 00:32:31.929
So said this M1 by two means.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6312-0
00:32:32.179 --> 00:32:35.329
Are you matching Punjabi with
data science or what?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6315-0
00:32:35.389 --> 00:32:36.619
No, no, no, no, no.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6320-0
00:32:35.439 --> 00:32:36.859
I no.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6341-0
00:32:36.629 --> 00:32:40.721
The first person that the one is
a record identifier or a or a

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6341-1
00:32:40.721 --> 00:32:43.709
tuple identifier or a data
object identifier.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6348-0
00:32:45.449 --> 00:32:46.979
OK, M12 is A.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6357-0
00:32:48.499 --> 00:32:49.249
Attribute.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6366-0
00:32:49.169 --> 00:32:51.659
Not just between one person one
and person 2.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6376-0
00:32:52.879 --> 00:32:54.909
Ohh person one bit and person 2.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6379-0
00:32:54.849 --> 00:32:55.479
Royce.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6406-0
00:32:57.149 --> 00:33:00.029
Wasn't one needs here and person
two is here?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6413-0
00:32:59.039 --> 00:33:02.130
Yeah, it's a there's a row wise
match on language and

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6409-0
00:33:00.879 --> 00:33:01.489
But between.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6413-1
00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:02.759
profession.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6422-0
00:33:03.679 --> 00:33:06.679
Yes, the language and profession
are nominal attributes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6439-0
00:33:07.559 --> 00:33:11.819
But between M2 and three, we
have doctor as common.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6442-0
00:33:12.589 --> 00:33:13.809
Yeah, that is why there is one.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6451-0
00:33:13.819 --> 00:33:14.989
That is what I'm saying here.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6460-0
00:33:14.529 --> 00:33:15.279
Ohk OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6458-0
00:33:14.999 --> 00:33:16.019
I have put it here.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6464-0
00:33:16.029 --> 00:33:16.469
I have put it.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6468-0
00:33:17.179 --> 00:33:17.939
OK, OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6475-0
00:33:18.429 --> 00:33:21.299
And between M of three, sorry.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6480-0
00:33:21.369 --> 00:33:23.669
Two and four both are matching.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6485-0
00:33:25.209 --> 00:33:26.249
Two and four.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6489-0
00:33:26.349 --> 00:33:26.639
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6494-0
00:33:27.929 --> 00:33:28.629
Both are matched.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6493-0
00:33:28.039 --> 00:33:28.459
Yeah, yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6504-0
00:33:31.849 --> 00:33:35.299
But one uh, Sir, one comma,
three.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6514-0
00:33:35.449 --> 00:33:37.039
OK, nothing is matching.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6542-0
00:33:35.949 --> 00:33:40.729
Umm, one comma three is 1 comma
three is actually no match.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6534-0
00:33:37.049 --> 00:33:38.149
That's why it is coming 0.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6541-0
00:33:38.899 --> 00:33:39.519
Is the.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6547-0
00:33:40.639 --> 00:33:40.779
And.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6549-0
00:33:40.739 --> 00:33:42.219
Again, one comma, three is also
zero.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6554-0
00:33:43.149 --> 00:33:43.769
Hmm.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6584-0
00:33:44.979 --> 00:33:52.196
And even if we do that three
comma, 3, comma four, it will

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6584-1
00:33:52.196 --> 00:33:53.909
come. One one.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6578-0
00:33:52.439 --> 00:33:53.469
One it will.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6582-0
00:33:53.659 --> 00:33:54.409
It should be one.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6587-0
00:33:54.379 --> 00:33:54.989
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6589-0
00:33:54.419 --> 00:33:55.019
Yes, right.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6601-0
00:33:55.269 --> 00:33:57.329
OK, OK now.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6603-0
00:33:56.839 --> 00:33:59.269
But it's it's not a complete
match cell.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6605-0
00:33:57.579 --> 00:33:57.879
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6609-0
00:33:58.749 --> 00:33:58.999
From.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6635-0
00:33:59.349 --> 00:34:03.658
How come it be 1 like there is
still some distance between them

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6635-1
00:34:03.658 --> 00:34:06.149
right from the language
perspective?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6652-0
00:34:06.769 --> 00:34:09.329
Who about whom you're talking
which record?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6658-0
00:34:08.379 --> 00:34:11.989
Three and four, if we compare
three and four.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6666-0
00:34:12.519 --> 00:34:12.879
Huh.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6677-0
00:34:12.519 --> 00:34:14.736
So the profession is matching,
but the language is not

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6677-1
00:34:14.736 --> 00:34:15.099
matching.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6673-0
00:34:15.689 --> 00:34:16.059
No, no.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6688-0
00:34:16.069 --> 00:34:18.571
That is why we are saying among
the two attributes one is

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6688-1
00:34:18.571 --> 00:34:18.959
matching.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6745-0
00:34:18.969 --> 00:34:22.082
That is what we are saying among
the two attributes one is

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6697-0
00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:20.499
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6704-0
00:34:20.509 --> 00:34:20.959
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6724-0
00:34:21.029 --> 00:34:21.929
OK, matches one.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6723-0
00:34:21.279 --> 00:34:21.839
We didn't know.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6745-1
00:34:22.082 --> 00:34:25.459
matching and then we are going
to apply we are, we are going to

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6739-0
00:34:23.039 --> 00:34:25.079
So when it yeah, yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6745-2
00:34:25.459 --> 00:34:27.359
apply the distance formula
finally.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6757-0
00:34:26.999 --> 00:34:28.409
OK, OK. Yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6768-0
00:34:27.669 --> 00:34:30.789
So first we need to get the
M&amp;P correct, then we can

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6768-1
00:34:30.789 --> 00:34:31.829
apply the distance.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6815-0
00:34:31.839 --> 00:34:35.556
For me this is we get these
correct and then this is going

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6781-0
00:34:32.839 --> 00:34:33.309
Makes sense?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6815-1
00:34:35.556 --> 00:34:39.399
to be equal to distance distance
in the range of zero to 10.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6835-0
00:34:37.509 --> 00:34:42.448
So if we compare two and four,
then if we compare 24 then two

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6835-1
00:34:42.448 --> 00:34:44.599
are matching both the peas.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6827-0
00:34:44.099 --> 00:34:44.429
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6844-0
00:34:44.439 --> 00:34:47.372
So the distance should come at
zero distance based on nominal

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6844-1
00:34:47.372 --> 00:34:48.129
attributes is 0.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6846-0
00:34:49.339 --> 00:34:50.179
Sir.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6860-0
00:34:50.229 --> 00:34:52.309
Sir, let's say they were seven
parameters.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6857-0
00:34:50.769 --> 00:34:50.929
No.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6877-0
00:34:52.319 --> 00:34:55.329
Let's say language, profession
and then it's age.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6873-0
00:34:54.009 --> 00:34:55.039
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fine.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6885-0
00:34:55.429 --> 00:34:56.149
Yeah. Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6920-0
00:34:55.799 --> 00:34:59.986
Then if one would match, that
would mean means equal to 1, and

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6888-0
00:34:56.519 --> 00:34:56.649
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6920-1
00:34:59.986 --> 00:35:01.979
if all five would match, yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6913-0
00:35:00.199 --> 00:35:02.569
Yeah, you're meet equal to 1 M
is equal to 1.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6956-0
00:35:02.579 --> 00:35:06.096
What you are saying is you M is
equal to 1 and P is equal to 7

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6939-0
00:35:05.279 --> 00:35:05.529
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6956-1
00:35:06.096 --> 00:35:08.719
and you will use the same
formula 7 -, 1 by 7.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6950-0
00:35:08.099 --> 00:35:09.239
OK, OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7005-0
00:35:09.249 --> 00:35:11.809
So basically there's no limit,
as if like you know,

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6968-0
00:35:11.189 --> 00:35:11.469
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6974-0
00:35:11.479 --> 00:35:12.119
Yeah, right.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7005-1
00:35:11.809 --> 00:35:14.419
probability, we generally go for
zero and one right.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6979-0
00:35:12.129 --> 00:35:12.579
Great.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/6995-0
00:35:12.649 --> 00:35:14.099
That is why we have put these
variables.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7013-0
00:35:14.919 --> 00:35:16.949
Yeah, yeah, that is why we have
put them as variables.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7020-0
00:35:17.109 --> 00:35:17.369
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7038-0
00:35:17.119 --> 00:35:20.001
And we have also declared that
we want a rigidity within the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7025-0
00:35:17.979 --> 00:35:18.149
Hello.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7038-1
00:35:20.001 --> 00:35:20.899
range of zero to 1.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7080-0
00:35:21.879 --> 00:35:25.575
So so like when we are forming
the metrics like then the column

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7046-0
00:35:22.249 --> 00:35:22.539
Alright.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7048-0
00:35:23.039 --> 00:35:23.199
But.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7080-1
00:35:25.575 --> 00:35:29.155
one would be like created based
on the lag language attribute

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7080-2
00:35:29.155 --> 00:35:32.908
only and then the second column
would be created on the basis of

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7080-3
00:35:32.908 --> 00:35:33.659
professional.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7086-0
00:35:34.579 --> 00:35:35.069
Is that correct?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7099-0
00:35:36.059 --> 00:35:38.709
No, no, in in this data set in
this data set.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7115-0
00:35:38.719 --> 00:35:43.502
But this this concept applies to
any any data set with any

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7115-1
00:35:43.502 --> 00:35:44.069
values.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7122-0
00:35:44.319 --> 00:35:45.809
It may not be language
profession.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7133-0
00:35:45.819 --> 00:35:49.881
For example, you are talking
about, let us say color and

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7133-1
00:35:49.881 --> 00:35:50.309
hobby.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7157-0
00:35:50.359 --> 00:35:53.937
So fine, you are saying that the
color is also matches or does

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7157-1
00:35:53.937 --> 00:35:56.209
not match hobby matches does not
match.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7189-0
00:35:56.539 --> 00:36:00.171
So you take them in the same way
the nominal attribute is that we

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7189-1
00:36:00.171 --> 00:36:03.363
have no ranking among the
values, but then the values can

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7189-2
00:36:03.363 --> 00:36:04.739
either match or mismatch.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7194-0
00:36:04.819 --> 00:36:05.179
That's it.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7221-0
00:36:06.469 --> 00:36:08.569
So so far each table.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7201-0
00:36:06.499 --> 00:36:06.829
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7225-0
00:36:06.699 --> 00:36:08.959
So kindly complete the matrix
for given example.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7218-0
00:36:06.839 --> 00:36:08.149
So what what I have?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7254-0
00:36:10.299 --> 00:36:13.931
So what I have understood here
is we take one row as a

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7249-0
00:36:10.509 --> 00:36:10.769
Uh.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7254-1
00:36:13.931 --> 00:36:17.629
reference and then we compare
all other rows with that.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7283-0
00:36:18.089 --> 00:36:22.320
That is how we generate the
first column and then the second

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7268-0
00:36:18.279 --> 00:36:19.999
Yeah, yeah, that means yeah,
yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7281-0
00:36:21.739 --> 00:36:21.989
Hmm.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7283-1
00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:23.569
per second column.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7314-0
00:36:23.579 --> 00:36:27.661
Your second row becomes the
reference and then you compare

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7314-1
00:36:27.661 --> 00:36:31.189
all the next rows with that
second row attributes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7306-0
00:36:30.579 --> 00:36:31.409
Absolutely right.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7323-0
00:36:31.419 --> 00:36:33.950
Absolutely right that that is,
that is how we create the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7323-1
00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:34.749
triangular matrix.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7329-0
00:36:34.759 --> 00:36:35.639
Absolutely right, yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7330-0
00:36:35.209 --> 00:36:36.539
OK, makes sense.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7336-0
00:36:39.989 --> 00:36:40.359
Yes, Sir.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7353-0
00:36:40.349 --> 00:36:41.969
Anyone. Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7350-0
00:36:40.369 --> 00:36:41.169
Please can so.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7356-0
00:36:41.379 --> 00:36:43.599
So in that case them one comma
one would be.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7364-0
00:36:45.279 --> 00:36:47.039
One comma one has to be 0,
right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7370-0
00:36:47.049 --> 00:36:49.029
Is it not so?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7383-0
00:36:49.139 --> 00:36:52.129
So distance of object to the
same object has to be 0.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7382-0
00:36:50.399 --> 00:36:50.569
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7398-0
00:36:53.869 --> 00:36:54.539
By definition.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7411-0
00:36:54.259 --> 00:36:57.089
The stands were busy though, but
the match would be too right.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7424-0
00:36:58.149 --> 00:37:00.659
The match is to when the match
is 2, the distance is 0.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7430-0
00:36:59.029 --> 00:36:59.239
The.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7462-0
00:37:00.669 --> 00:37:04.967
Is it not when P is equal to 2P
is equal to M, the distance is

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7462-1
00:37:04.967 --> 00:37:06.399
0, right, P -, M / P?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7453-0
00:37:05.289 --> 00:37:05.789
Yeah, yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7458-0
00:37:07.759 --> 00:37:08.099
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7476-0
00:37:08.019 --> 00:37:09.979
2 minus ZERO 2 -, 0 by 2.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7477-0
00:37:08.239 --> 00:37:10.019
And so you get a 0 on the.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7510-0
00:37:12.269 --> 00:37:15.819
So is there zero or is it once
or two if?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7496-0
00:37:12.469 --> 00:37:13.309
Yes, yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7505-0
00:37:15.139 --> 00:37:16.509
No, no, no, no, no.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7529-0
00:37:16.519 --> 00:37:18.957
When the distance it is zero,
when similarity it will be 1

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7529-1
00:37:18.957 --> 00:37:20.569
similarity we will see how to
compute.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7538-0
00:37:20.579 --> 00:37:22.569
We'll come to that, but the
distance is 0, right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7544-0
00:37:25.379 --> 00:37:25.639
We can.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7581-0
00:37:25.649 --> 00:37:28.929
We complete the matrix for the
given example for better

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7567-0
00:37:26.459 --> 00:37:26.849
What do you want?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7563-0
00:37:28.179 --> 00:37:28.529
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7577-0
00:37:28.339 --> 00:37:28.659
Yummy.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7579-0
00:37:28.539 --> 00:37:29.559
Can you go back to that slide?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7581-1
00:37:28.929 --> 00:37:29.749
understanding.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7595-0
00:37:30.889 --> 00:37:33.319
This this matrix or you want
this matrix?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7611-0
00:37:33.809 --> 00:37:35.779
No, here the example what you're
explaining.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7605-0
00:37:35.109 --> 00:37:35.289
You.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7614-0
00:37:35.799 --> 00:37:36.719
Yeah, here.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7606-0
00:37:36.509 --> 00:37:36.799
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7608-0
00:37:36.809 --> 00:37:37.039
What?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7623-0
00:37:37.049 --> 00:37:40.429
What I'm explaining OK, so let
me let me go to.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7628-0
00:37:41.259 --> 00:37:41.439
Cool.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7633-0
00:37:41.969 --> 00:37:44.189
Alright, So what I will do is.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7669-0
00:37:46.799 --> 00:37:50.250
And so it matters where we
always between zero and one like

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7669-1
00:37:50.250 --> 00:37:52.839
the the method that will be
created correct.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7682-0
00:37:54.169 --> 00:37:55.499
What is the question, Mr Abina?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7700-0
00:37:56.799 --> 00:37:59.216
I said the matters that you're
creating right now is between

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7700-1
00:37:59.216 --> 00:38:00.009
zero and one, right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7727-0
00:38:00.439 --> 00:38:02.759
So with the matrix one.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7731-0
00:38:00.449 --> 00:38:03.196
Yeah, yeah, that is all the all
the all the elements will be

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7731-1
00:38:03.196 --> 00:38:05.764
between zero and one based on
the formula we have taken,

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7731-2
00:38:05.764 --> 00:38:06.259
right? Yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7733-0
00:38:07.519 --> 00:38:08.239
But thank you.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7738-0
00:38:12.789 --> 00:38:13.199
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7745-0
00:38:13.249 --> 00:38:15.579
So we will complete the metrics.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7770-0
00:38:15.589 --> 00:38:19.610
So for that what I need to do is
I'll let me create a duplicate

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7770-1
00:38:19.610 --> 00:38:21.809
of the slide and then go here
and.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7782-0
00:38:23.719 --> 00:38:26.129
Because it's not allowing me to
erase in part.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7789-0
00:38:26.139 --> 00:38:27.419
So let me erase the whole thing.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7808-0
00:38:30.299 --> 00:38:34.995
All right, so So what I have got
here is that let me put the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7808-1
00:38:34.995 --> 00:38:35.919
values back.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7820-0
00:38:40.159 --> 00:38:44.389
Uh, So what we have is the ID.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7830-0
00:38:45.569 --> 00:38:50.869
Then we have a the language, and
we have a profession.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7839-0
00:38:52.909 --> 00:38:55.719
OK, SO1234.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7845-0
00:38:56.089 --> 00:38:56.739
And then what?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7853-0
00:38:56.749 --> 00:39:00.259
We put it P DHD right.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7861-0
00:39:02.559 --> 00:39:08.329
BDSHB.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7876-0
00:39:08.939 --> 00:39:16.429
Doctor, I'm putting it as DVR,
then BDR and then HDR.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7904-0
00:39:16.619 --> 00:39:21.883
OK, so now we want to compute
the matrix so the matrix is

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7904-1
00:39:21.883 --> 00:39:26.239
going to be the distance matrix
is going to be.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7930-0
00:39:27.689 --> 00:39:31.793
Said if I marry quest and more
parameters and less rows to get

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7930-1
00:39:31.793 --> 00:39:34.659
the sense of it because if less
parameters.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7947-0
00:39:36.789 --> 00:39:38.619
No, the formula is same.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7951-0
00:39:36.909 --> 00:39:37.959
They may not get the full
lesson.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7954-0
00:39:38.629 --> 00:39:39.829
So how does that?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7967-0
00:39:39.989 --> 00:39:43.249
Because we will take more time,
but the formula is same, right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7977-0
00:39:44.199 --> 00:39:45.929
The we will use the same
formula.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7995-0
00:39:45.999 --> 00:39:49.565
The number of parameters, number
of parameters minus the number

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/7995-1
00:39:49.565 --> 00:39:52.239
of matches divided by the number
of parameters.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8040-0
00:39:53.159 --> 00:39:59.531
So with the one this is we are
getting zero with one, two also

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8040-1
00:39:59.531 --> 00:40:06.105
we are getting one to one is 01
to two is 0 then one to three is

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8040-2
00:40:06.105 --> 00:40:11.769
0 and ohh I'm sorry distance is
matches are zero right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8055-0
00:40:11.879 --> 00:40:13.999
So I'm sorry, just give me one
minute.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8079-0
00:40:13.929 --> 00:40:18.019
Ah, how one to two is 0, Sir.
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8059-0
00:40:16.009 --> 00:40:16.259
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8063-0
00:40:16.269 --> 00:40:16.419
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8067-0
00:40:16.429 --> 00:40:17.219
Just give me one minute.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8074-0
00:40:17.229 --> 00:40:18.079
Give me one minute.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8076-0
00:40:18.749 --> 00:40:19.499
I have.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8090-0
00:40:19.549 --> 00:40:21.679
I have to correct so this is 0.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8099-0
00:40:22.249 --> 00:40:24.499
This is 111.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8117-0
00:40:25.319 --> 00:40:28.879
OK, so so now we need to
compute.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8108-0
00:40:28.339 --> 00:40:28.489
A.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8110-0
00:40:28.499 --> 00:40:29.029
How?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8136-0
00:40:29.039 --> 00:40:32.709
How it is one mile, Sir, it is
2, huh?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8125-0
00:40:30.859 --> 00:40:31.249
One.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8129-0
00:40:31.259 --> 00:40:31.949
OK, OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8146-0
00:40:32.019 --> 00:40:36.069
So the matches between one and
two are zero, right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8157-0
00:40:36.139 --> 00:40:40.279
M0 between one and two object
one and object 2.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8160-0
00:40:40.469 --> 00:40:41.609
The language is different.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8168-0
00:40:41.619 --> 00:40:42.449
Profession is different.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8176-0
00:40:42.909 --> 00:40:45.269
Yeah, both are different, so.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8182-0
00:40:44.799 --> 00:40:47.689
So P is P is 2 and M is 2.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8195-0
00:40:47.859 --> 00:40:51.429
So common things are zero, so 0
/ P zero.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8200-0
00:40:51.439 --> 00:40:52.549
So we are getting zero.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8203-0
00:40:52.959 --> 00:40:54.029
Sorry. Sorry.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8211-0
00:40:54.039 --> 00:40:55.689
No, no, P is not sorry.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8229-0
00:40:55.759 --> 00:41:00.169
You're now instead of me can me
confusing you are confusing me.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8241-0
00:41:00.179 --> 00:41:02.429
OK, so the P is too always two.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8243-0
00:41:01.109 --> 00:41:01.529
Interesting.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8250-0
00:41:02.519 --> 00:41:04.219
OK, the M is changing.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8265-0
00:41:04.439 --> 00:41:11.669
So M is 0 so so 2 -, 0 by two,
which is equal to 1.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8292-0
00:41:11.979 --> 00:41:16.743
So which is with respect to one
to 2123 and 124, all of them are

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8292-1
00:41:16.743 --> 00:41:17.989
coming to be one.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8294-0
00:41:18.789 --> 00:41:19.519
Today, right.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8298-0
00:41:19.529 --> 00:41:19.689
Right.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8318-0
00:41:20.319 --> 00:41:22.309
OK, so now let us take you.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8315-0
00:41:20.629 --> 00:41:21.409
Hmm. Hmm.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8323-0
00:41:21.479 --> 00:41:23.569
And the first element will
always be 0, Sir.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8330-0
00:41:23.929 --> 00:41:24.399
Yeah, yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8338-0
00:41:24.369 --> 00:41:25.059
I mean the top one.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8348-0
00:41:24.409 --> 00:41:28.219
Better all the darknell elements
are zero, so 222 is also zero.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8347-0
00:41:27.339 --> 00:41:27.619
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8371-0
00:41:28.589 --> 00:41:36.237
Then 2-3 let us see one is
matched, M is equal to 1 and 2.5

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8368-0
00:41:34.209 --> 00:41:34.889
The .5.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8371-1
00:41:36.237 --> 00:41:36.619
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8382-0
00:41:36.769 --> 00:41:38.719
So now let us look at two to
four.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8413-0
00:41:38.729 --> 00:41:43.433
Both are matched, so the
distance EG zero distance is 0

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8397-0
00:41:40.159 --> 00:41:41.139
To .5 again.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8413-1
00:41:43.433 --> 00:41:47.129
because the yummy is 2 and P is
anyway too.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8422-0
00:41:47.179 --> 00:41:48.749
So 2 -, 2, so it is 0.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8439-0
00:41:49.009 --> 00:41:52.359
But Doctor, Doctor is matching
with Doctor, right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8431-0
00:41:49.249 --> 00:41:50.009
So now let.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8452-0
00:41:52.939 --> 00:41:57.131
Yeah, that is why the match
between two and four between two

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8452-1
00:41:57.131 --> 00:41:57.749
and four.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8462-0
00:41:57.799 --> 00:42:01.689
The the distance is 0 because it
is H3.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8471-0
00:42:01.699 --> 00:42:02.869
Is this and H4?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8492-0
00:42:02.879 --> 00:42:05.699
Is this H and Dr so both of them
are matched?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8476-0
00:42:03.599 --> 00:42:03.979
Got it.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8485-0
00:42:03.989 --> 00:42:04.479
Got it. Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8501-0
00:42:06.459 --> 00:42:07.969
The 2 -, 2, zero. OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8495-0
00:42:06.779 --> 00:42:06.939
Yep.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8498-0
00:42:08.359 --> 00:42:08.989
Yeah, right.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8517-0
00:42:08.999 --> 00:42:13.661
OK, so now let us look at three
and three to three zero and

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8517-1
00:42:13.661 --> 00:42:14.749
three to four.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8542-0
00:42:14.879 --> 00:42:20.111
So one match among the two
parameters, so it is .5 and then

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8532-0
00:42:16.449 --> 00:42:16.999
.5.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8542-1
00:42:20.111 --> 00:42:20.809
this is.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8546-0
00:42:20.879 --> 00:42:22.559
This completes the triangular
matrix.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8568-0
00:42:25.929 --> 00:42:28.559
So so always it will be like
lower triangular metrics.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8566-0
00:42:28.979 --> 00:42:29.849
No, not necessary.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8608-0
00:42:29.859 --> 00:42:32.479
You can write upper triangular
matrix also because it's going

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8608-1
00:42:32.479 --> 00:42:35.057
to give you the same answer
right upper triangular matrix is

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8608-2
00:42:35.057 --> 00:42:37.382
also giving you the same
information as a lower trend,

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8608-3
00:42:37.382 --> 00:42:40.129
but then the authors of the book
may have their own preferences.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8618-0
00:42:44.259 --> 00:42:45.509
Now it is clear.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8631-0
00:42:46.019 --> 00:42:46.599
Thank you, Sir.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8648-0
00:42:46.079 --> 00:42:49.654
So either you compare from
bottom to up and up to bottom,

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8632-0
00:42:46.309 --> 00:42:46.649
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8648-1
00:42:49.654 --> 00:42:50.579
depends on you.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8641-0
00:42:50.919 --> 00:42:51.269
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8645-0
00:42:51.279 --> 00:42:51.989
Yeah, right. Right.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8651-0
00:42:51.999 --> 00:42:53.109
It doesn't make matter.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8675-0
00:42:53.119 --> 00:42:56.996
OK, so now let us let us proceed
to a new type of variable which

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8661-0
00:42:53.569 --> 00:42:53.769
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8669-0
00:42:54.769 --> 00:42:55.199
The.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8675-1
00:42:56.996 --> 00:42:58.189
is ordinal variable.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8688-0
00:42:58.499 --> 00:43:00.849
So we need to think about this
in a different way.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8709-0
00:43:01.059 --> 00:43:03.765
So far we looked at saying that
all the professions are same and

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8709-1
00:43:03.765 --> 00:43:04.889
all the languages are same.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8719-0
00:43:04.899 --> 00:43:07.809
So we cannot only say matched or
mismatched.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8742-0
00:43:08.079 --> 00:43:12.400
So now let us say the attributes
are like they have a relation

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8742-1
00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:14.389
which is in order among them.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8752-0
00:43:14.799 --> 00:43:17.129
So it is like a military
ranking.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8775-0
00:43:17.139 --> 00:43:23.513
So you cannot say that kernel
and major odd same or in general

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8775-1
00:43:23.513 --> 00:43:25.739
and and major or same.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8785-0
00:43:25.749 --> 00:43:27.829
So you say that there is a
distance between the.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8825-0
00:43:28.649 --> 00:43:33.498
So so now, now you have got
grades, grades, let us say ABC

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8825-1
00:43:33.498 --> 00:43:38.347
and then you have you have to
define an order between them

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8825-2
00:43:38.347 --> 00:43:42.949
saying that A is superior to
B&amp;B is superior to AC.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8841-0
00:43:43.359 --> 00:43:47.037
Similarly with respect to the
size you have to create an order

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8841-1
00:43:47.037 --> 00:43:47.679
among them.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8859-0
00:43:48.529 --> 00:43:52.365
So these are also categorical
variables, but these are ordinal

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8850-0
00:43:49.799 --> 00:43:50.029
Stop.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8859-1
00:43:52.365 --> 00:43:52.669
type.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8864-0
00:43:52.679 --> 00:43:53.839
They have got an order.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8881-0
00:43:54.829 --> 00:43:58.065
These are not simple nominal,
but they are a specialization of

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8881-1
00:43:58.065 --> 00:43:59.349
nominal which is ordinal.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8888-0
00:43:59.909 --> 00:44:01.099
So we call them.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8898-0
00:44:01.109 --> 00:44:03.309
In fact, many people don't refer
them as nominal.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8921-0
00:44:03.319 --> 00:44:06.569
They just say they are nodding
so they look like nominal

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8921-1
00:44:06.569 --> 00:44:09.249
because they are also having a
variable value.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8945-0
00:44:09.429 --> 00:44:13.632
So now what we need to do is
that we need to have a mechanism

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8937-0
00:44:11.349 --> 00:44:11.649
That.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8945-1
00:44:13.632 --> 00:44:15.259
to compute the distance.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8982-0
00:44:15.269 --> 00:44:21.187
What we do is that we are going
to assign them values one to M

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8960-0
00:44:15.959 --> 00:44:17.949
Hold on but.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8982-1
00:44:21.187 --> 00:44:26.917
based on their order, and then
we using that we are going to

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8982-2
00:44:26.917 --> 00:44:28.889
compute the distance.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/8985-0
00:44:29.219 --> 00:44:29.889
So.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9011-0
00:44:29.959 --> 00:44:34.833
So what we do is that suppose
there is a, there is a variable

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9011-1
00:44:34.833 --> 00:44:37.899
which is in the fair good index
layer.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9015-0
00:44:38.019 --> 00:44:38.469
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9026-0
00:44:38.759 --> 00:44:43.369
So we are saying that the three
grades that are given are fair.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9030-0
00:44:45.539 --> 00:44:47.369
Good and excellent.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9066-0
00:44:49.259 --> 00:44:53.619
So what we are going to do is
that put one here 2 here and

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9066-1
00:44:53.619 --> 00:44:58.349
three here and then we are going
to create a jet score of this.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9077-0
00:44:58.859 --> 00:45:02.589
Based on that, we are going to
give the ranks.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9093-0
00:45:02.859 --> 00:45:07.141
So now what we say is that this
is representing the maximum

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9093-1
00:45:07.141 --> 00:45:07.569
value.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9132-0
00:45:07.979 --> 00:45:12.599
This is representing the minimum
value and we are going to create

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9132-1
00:45:12.599 --> 00:45:16.659
a jet score for each one of
these values and that will be

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9132-2
00:45:16.659 --> 00:45:21.069
that will be actual value minus
1 divided by the maximum value

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9132-3
00:45:21.069 --> 00:45:21.769
minus one.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9137-0
00:45:22.139 --> 00:45:23.279
So what will happen?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9147-0
00:45:23.289 --> 00:45:25.089
This is going to get a score of
0.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9159-0
00:45:25.099 --> 00:45:26.969
This is going to get a score of
.1.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9166-0
00:45:26.979 --> 00:45:27.939
This is going to get a score of.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9180-0
00:45:36.489 --> 00:45:40.419
All right, so so here is here is
the example.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9195-0
00:45:40.709 --> 00:45:46.521
So we have three grades that
people have got, excellent fade

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9195-1
00:45:46.521 --> 00:45:47.379
and good.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9231-0
00:45:47.749 --> 00:45:51.302
So we are calling fade as one
good as two excellent as three

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9231-1
00:45:51.302 --> 00:45:54.798
and then once we create a jet
score which is which we make,

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9231-2
00:45:54.798 --> 00:45:57.419
some people may refer as a
normalized score.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9253-0
00:45:57.789 --> 00:46:00.874
So what you are getting is that
you're converting them into

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9253-1
00:46:00.874 --> 00:46:02.519
values in the range of 0 to one.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9287-0
00:46:02.889 --> 00:46:06.644
So now if you want to compute
the distance, the suppose that

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9287-1
00:46:06.644 --> 00:46:10.337
there are four students with
this, so you want to compute a

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9287-2
00:46:10.337 --> 00:46:11.999
distance matrix among them.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9320-0
00:46:12.109 --> 00:46:15.925
So you are getting distance
between one and two is 1 -, 0

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9320-1
00:46:15.925 --> 00:46:20.069
distance between one and three
is 1 -, .5 distance between one

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9320-2
00:46:20.069 --> 00:46:21.319
and four is 1 -, 1.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9325-0
00:46:21.329 --> 00:46:22.569
So this is what you'll get.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9331-0
00:46:29.919 --> 00:46:30.219
Right.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9337-0
00:46:31.799 --> 00:46:32.369
So they're gonna.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9344-0
00:46:32.109 --> 00:46:32.339
Uh.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9347-0
00:46:32.379 --> 00:46:34.299
Let's explain it once again,
please.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9359-0
00:46:34.639 --> 00:46:35.959
I didn't the rank part.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9354-0
00:46:34.719 --> 00:46:35.079
Yeah, yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9360-0
00:46:35.029 --> 00:46:35.309
Umm.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9357-0
00:46:36.919 --> 00:46:37.229
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9368-0
00:46:37.239 --> 00:46:37.479
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9371-0
00:46:37.539 --> 00:46:38.109
So.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9401-0
00:46:38.029 --> 00:46:41.169
I think the please baby, please
be bit slow.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9396-0
00:46:38.179 --> 00:46:41.442
So the bank part first thing is
that we are we are trying to do

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9396-1
00:46:41.442 --> 00:46:42.309
a simplification.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9420-0
00:46:42.319 --> 00:46:45.750
We are doing a simplification,
so we are saying that all the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9420-1
00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:48.169
ranks are equally distant from
each other.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9467-0
00:46:48.889 --> 00:46:53.064
So what we are doing is that we
are we have started putting the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9467-1
00:46:53.064 --> 00:46:57.305
numbers so that we will be able
to get a score in the range of 0

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9467-2
00:46:57.305 --> 00:47:01.285
to one and then we are going to
start computing the distance

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9467-3
00:47:01.285 --> 00:47:02.459
using those codes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9492-0
00:47:02.469 --> 00:47:07.220
So what we did is so, so we have
converted excellent becomes 1

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9492-1
00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:11.519
fair becomes zero and good
becomes something in between.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9528-0
00:47:11.529 --> 00:47:15.262
So but suppose you have more
number of grades, so then the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9528-1
00:47:15.262 --> 00:47:17.729
grading will be different, so it
will.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9547-0
00:47:17.079 --> 00:47:19.876
Is it a similar way we should
did the last example or

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9547-1
00:47:19.876 --> 00:47:22.569
different formulas or and were
able to relate that?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9543-0
00:47:20.709 --> 00:47:20.859
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9554-0
00:47:21.559 --> 00:47:25.279
This is a no no, forget about
last example.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9570-0
00:47:25.289 --> 00:47:28.056
Last example is about nominal
attributes, so now we are

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9570-1
00:47:28.056 --> 00:47:29.539
looking at ordinal attributes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9604-0
00:47:29.989 --> 00:47:34.043
So what we are saying is that so
our intent of this lecture is to

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9604-1
00:47:34.043 --> 00:47:37.360
tell you that distance
computation is nontrivial task

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9604-2
00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:39.879
and then we are going through
the steps.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9625-0
00:47:39.949 --> 00:47:43.161
So we have completed for one
type of variable and then we are

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9625-1
00:47:43.161 --> 00:47:44.819
working on 2nd type of variable.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9631-0
00:47:45.229 --> 00:47:46.419
So second type of variable.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9639-0
00:47:46.429 --> 00:47:47.779
Again, you again think about
them.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9650-0
00:47:48.069 --> 00:47:50.519
So this is ordinal where there
is a ranking.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9670-0
00:47:50.749 --> 00:47:54.380
So we have to put them into a
ranking order and then we need

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9670-1
00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:55.809
to compute the distance.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9682-0
00:47:55.889 --> 00:47:56.799
A vacation.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9677-0
00:47:56.099 --> 00:47:57.809
So am I am In Sync?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9683-0
00:47:57.819 --> 00:47:58.569
Who is the person?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9686-0
00:47:58.579 --> 00:47:59.029
Who is?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9697-0
00:47:59.119 --> 00:47:59.999
Who asked this question?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9719-0
00:48:00.809 --> 00:48:03.349
I asked about candidates, show
the example again once.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9717-0
00:48:01.949 --> 00:48:04.429
OK, Miss money it, miss Manisha.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9724-0
00:48:04.439 --> 00:48:04.879
Is that clear?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9756-0
00:48:06.269 --> 00:48:08.439
Uh, Sir, I have one question
regarding this.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9736-0
00:48:07.439 --> 00:48:07.939
No, Sir.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9748-0
00:48:08.869 --> 00:48:09.299
No, no.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9774-0
00:48:09.209 --> 00:48:10.649
Essential hello.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9781-0
00:48:09.309 --> 00:48:12.169
OK, Miss Manisha is asking me
more, more clarification.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9778-0
00:48:09.419 --> 00:48:11.399
But could you please go back on
the flight service?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9779-0
00:48:11.589 --> 00:48:11.819
No.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9793-0
00:48:13.019 --> 00:48:15.009
Yeah, if you can you know.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9794-0
00:48:14.439 --> 00:48:15.589
But I can give teams honey.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9811-0
00:48:17.659 --> 00:48:19.279
Explain one more time.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9822-0
00:48:18.869 --> 00:48:19.059
That.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9832-0
00:48:19.339 --> 00:48:20.559
A bit slow, I mean I.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9808-0
00:48:19.549 --> 00:48:19.799
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9818-0
00:48:19.809 --> 00:48:20.459
Yeah, we do that.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9851-0
00:48:20.469 --> 00:48:23.098
I mean, I will do that one more
time, but meanwhile somebody

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9855-0
00:48:21.929 --> 00:48:24.779
And and also please be on the
slides, so don't come on the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9851-1
00:48:23.098 --> 00:48:24.089
wants to say something.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9855-1
00:48:24.779 --> 00:48:25.069
teams.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9870-0
00:48:26.659 --> 00:48:29.009
The point is that OK, I will
stay on the anyway.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9887-0
00:48:29.019 --> 00:48:32.357
I'm going back to slide now and
then staying there because

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9887-1
00:48:32.357 --> 00:48:33.489
somebody is talking.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9896-0
00:48:33.499 --> 00:48:34.739
I just want to know what is the?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9901-0
00:48:34.779 --> 00:48:35.809
What is the question?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9928-0
00:48:35.819 --> 00:48:38.735
And then only if I remove the
slide, maybe I'll be able to

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9924-0
00:48:37.359 --> 00:48:39.329
Right, Sir.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9928-1
00:48:38.735 --> 00:48:39.279
check that.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9926-0
00:48:39.339 --> 00:48:40.989
111 question I have.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9935-0
00:48:41.059 --> 00:48:41.579
Can you hear me?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9943-0
00:48:42.789 --> 00:48:44.859
Yes, Mr Charan.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9941-0
00:48:43.169 --> 00:48:43.459
Yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9946-0
00:48:44.459 --> 00:48:45.909
We have. Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9954-0
00:48:44.869 --> 00:48:45.739
Yeah, yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9997-0
00:48:45.949 --> 00:48:48.860
So in in nominal we were
talking, we were talking about 3

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9997-1
00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:52.021
attributes at once and then this
ordinal attribute we are just

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9997-2
00:48:52.021 --> 00:48:54.279
taking one attribute that is
test right and.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/9983-0
00:48:53.449 --> 00:48:53.719
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10000-0
00:48:53.729 --> 00:48:53.899
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10005-0
00:48:53.909 --> 00:48:56.871
We we'll go to more attributes,
but first let us be clear about

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10005-1
00:48:56.871 --> 00:48:57.519
one attribute.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10032-0
00:48:57.529 --> 00:48:59.579
How do you compute so in
previous?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10016-0
00:48:58.239 --> 00:48:58.599
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10047-0
00:48:58.609 --> 00:49:01.299
I I just wanted to understand
that that's this, this.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10038-0
00:48:59.589 --> 00:49:01.169
Previously this, Mr.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10042-0
00:49:01.179 --> 00:49:01.999
Chairman, just listen.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10048-0
00:49:02.009 --> 00:49:02.739
Listen for a minute.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10080-0
00:49:02.749 --> 00:49:05.889
OK, then you can ask when the
nominal attributes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10088-0
00:49:05.899 --> 00:49:09.336
When we took only one attribute,
let us say color, all we said is

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10088-1
00:49:09.336 --> 00:49:12.409
that the distance can be either
zero or one, nothing else.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10091-0
00:49:12.549 --> 00:49:13.259
Is that correct?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10111-0
00:49:13.269 --> 00:49:16.639
I hope you remember that either
it matches or does not match.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10109-0
00:49:13.929 --> 00:49:14.949
Yeah. Hmm.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10133-0
00:49:16.649 --> 00:49:19.689
It matches the distance is 0 if
it does not match, the distance

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10133-1
00:49:19.689 --> 00:49:21.019
is 1, but ordinal attribute.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10159-0
00:49:21.029 --> 00:49:24.730
What we are saying is that if
when they don't match, don't put

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10159-1
00:49:24.730 --> 00:49:28.079
it as a blindly as one compute
using a normalized score.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10163-0
00:49:28.489 --> 00:49:28.949
Is that clear?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10169-0
00:49:30.429 --> 00:49:31.619
Yes, that is clear.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10175-0
00:49:31.769 --> 00:49:33.199
My question is a bit different.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10222-0
00:49:33.209 --> 00:49:36.424
Uh, all I wanted to know is
whether this in in case of

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10222-1
00:49:36.424 --> 00:49:39.523
ordinal attributes we are
creating separate distance

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10222-2
00:49:39.523 --> 00:49:42.563
matrix for each attribute
whereas in normal we were

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10235-0
00:49:41.379 --> 00:49:44.186
Mariabelle each variable right
each each parameter or

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10222-3
00:49:42.563 --> 00:49:43.089
creating.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10235-1
00:49:44.186 --> 00:49:45.329
attribute, right? Yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10243-0
00:49:45.489 --> 00:49:47.779
Yeah, but in nominal, we were
creating just one matrix.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10249-0
00:49:47.789 --> 00:49:48.019
Which?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10260-0
00:49:47.949 --> 00:49:50.999
Because because all of them are
computed in the same way, right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10262-0
00:49:48.029 --> 00:49:49.719
Uh, concerted everything.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10286-0
00:49:51.049 --> 00:49:54.548
All of them either match or
mismatch, nothing else, either

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10273-0
00:49:51.789 --> 00:49:52.039
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10296-0
00:49:53.969 --> 00:49:56.199
OK on this.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10286-1
00:49:54.548 --> 00:49:55.259
zero or one.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10297-0
00:49:55.489 --> 00:49:57.349
But in this case we have to
treat it differently.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10301-0
00:50:01.239 --> 00:50:01.779
Alright, alright.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10309-0
00:50:02.329 --> 00:50:03.579
I mean, OK from my side.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10311-0
00:50:04.349 --> 00:50:04.999
All right.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10325-0
00:50:05.509 --> 00:50:09.519
OK, so so I think I think, Miss
Manisha said.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10334-0
00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:11.539
She still needs an explanation,
right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10338-0
00:50:11.549 --> 00:50:12.429
Miss Manisha, can we talk?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10345-0
00:50:15.519 --> 00:50:16.449
That yeah, yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10347-0
00:50:17.609 --> 00:50:18.399
OK, OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10375-0
00:50:18.489 --> 00:50:22.233
So you are clear about that the
grades are ranked, so they

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10375-1
00:50:22.233 --> 00:50:25.659
cannot be treated simply as two
grades are different.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10373-0
00:50:23.129 --> 00:50:23.319
Hey.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10394-0
00:50:25.969 --> 00:50:30.370
So you need to say that good is
close to excellent compared to

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10394-1
00:50:30.370 --> 00:50:30.719
fair.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10400-0
00:50:31.029 --> 00:50:31.509
Is that clear?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10403-0
00:50:32.519 --> 00:50:32.719
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10413-0
00:50:33.799 --> 00:50:38.129
OK, so so this normalization
value it is representing that.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10419-0
00:50:38.179 --> 00:50:39.049
Do you agree with that?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10441-0
00:50:39.299 --> 00:50:42.499
So you are seeing on the slide I
have put an arrow below that

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10441-1
00:50:42.499 --> 00:50:43.479
actual differences.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10443-0
00:50:43.189 --> 00:50:43.309
Yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10452-0
00:50:43.989 --> 00:50:46.369
So that is that is looking good,
right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10459-0
00:50:46.479 --> 00:50:48.649
So now use that to compute
distance.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10457-0
00:50:47.089 --> 00:50:47.309
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10464-0
00:50:49.179 --> 00:50:50.679
Use that to compute distance.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10483-0
00:50:53.429 --> 00:50:55.479
Look at it carefully. Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10502-0
00:50:53.719 --> 00:50:58.826
But in that in that case only
one and four has has two

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10502-1
00:50:58.826 --> 00:51:00.219
matches, right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10499-0
00:50:59.409 --> 00:51:01.099
One in for it is not matching.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10510-0
00:51:01.109 --> 00:51:03.609
Don't talk about matching with
ordinary attributes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10532-0
00:51:03.619 --> 00:51:06.825
Ordinal attributes we have to
compute the distance so it is no

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10532-1
00:51:06.825 --> 00:51:09.319
longer matching the same formula
does not apply.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10530-0
00:51:06.969 --> 00:51:07.329
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10549-0
00:51:11.859 --> 00:51:14.776
So we need to compute The Jets
score and then compute the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10549-1
00:51:14.776 --> 00:51:15.229
distance.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10552-0
00:51:16.289 --> 00:51:17.519
So what is here?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10576-0
00:51:17.569 --> 00:51:22.509
Ours are Rif, is is ranking.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10573-0
00:51:20.239 --> 00:51:23.629
R is a ranking, R is the actual
ranking value.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10590-0
00:51:23.719 --> 00:51:27.299
So what you can see is that for
fail, the value is 0.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10624-0
00:51:27.699 --> 00:51:33.401
For fail, the ranking is 1, so Z
score is 0 for good, the ranking

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10624-1
00:51:33.401 --> 00:51:38.499
is 2, jet score is .5 for
excellent, ranking is 3 and Jets

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10613-0
00:51:34.419 --> 00:51:34.649
Hello.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10624-2
00:51:38.499 --> 00:51:39.449
score is 1.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10627-0
00:51:39.499 --> 00:51:39.919
Is that clear?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10633-0
00:51:41.419 --> 00:51:43.509
Hmm yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10638-0
00:51:43.939 --> 00:51:46.909
Not no, not Sir.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10640-0
00:51:46.969 --> 00:51:47.329
No, Sir.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10643-0
00:51:49.059 --> 00:51:49.479
No.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10647-0
00:51:49.549 --> 00:51:50.669
OK, alright.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10651-0
00:51:50.399 --> 00:51:50.659
Mm-hmm.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10657-0
00:51:51.099 --> 00:51:53.569
Any volunteer to explain to Miss
Manisha?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10664-0
00:51:56.029 --> 00:51:58.069
Shall I give an attempt to
Manisha?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10679-0
00:52:00.039 --> 00:52:01.189
Who wants to miss Jangiti?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10685-0
00:52:00.619 --> 00:52:01.609
Same thing here.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10687-0
00:52:01.199 --> 00:52:02.029
Yes, please go ahead.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10702-0
00:52:01.739 --> 00:52:02.659
Yeah, 20 here.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10699-0
00:52:02.039 --> 00:52:03.509
I'm showing the slide you
explained.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10711-0
00:52:03.519 --> 00:52:03.799
Yes, yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10712-0
00:52:03.909 --> 00:52:05.709
Uh, yeah, you can go to the
slide.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10716-0
00:52:09.079 --> 00:52:09.809
Manisha.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10723-0
00:52:10.699 --> 00:52:12.349
So you just I'm.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10769-0
00:52:12.359 --> 00:52:16.928
I'm first going to compare
between the last method and this

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10769-1
00:52:16.928 --> 00:52:21.574
method right last method we
computed distance right distance

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10769-2
00:52:21.574 --> 00:52:26.144
equal to P -, m by M right and
that is what you used in the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10769-3
00:52:26.144 --> 00:52:28.809
matrix which is on the right
side.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10775-0
00:52:28.899 --> 00:52:29.359
Is that clear?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10795-0
00:52:29.749 --> 00:52:33.769
P -, M BPP, total number of
parameters, yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10792-0
00:52:32.349 --> 00:52:32.549
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10787-0
00:52:32.749 --> 00:52:33.679
Sorry, P -.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10808-0
00:52:33.689 --> 00:52:38.440
M by P so the last method the
right side matrix was computed

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10808-1
00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:39.219
using P -.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10814-0
00:52:39.269 --> 00:52:40.969
M by P is that clear?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10821-0
00:52:40.779 --> 00:52:42.049
Yes. Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10840-0
00:52:42.709 --> 00:52:47.359
OK, so in this in this original
attribute, you're going to use

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10840-1
00:52:47.359 --> 00:52:48.319
two formulas.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10854-0
00:52:48.329 --> 00:52:51.399
I'm just going to explain only
from the mathematical view.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10856-0
00:52:50.139 --> 00:52:50.319
No.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10858-0
00:52:51.469 --> 00:52:51.779
Right.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10887-0
00:52:52.089 --> 00:52:56.492
So I'm going to use two formulas
for computing the matrix which

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10865-0
00:52:52.529 --> 00:52:52.819
Hmm.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10887-1
00:52:56.492 --> 00:53:00.069
is on the right side, which is
the D matrix, right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10893-0
00:53:00.289 --> 00:53:02.319
You're going to use the formula.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10891-0
00:53:00.599 --> 00:53:00.899
Hmm.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10896-0
00:53:03.249 --> 00:53:03.779
Uh.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10907-0
00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:06.399
A 1 -, A two, A 1 -.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10931-0
00:53:06.409 --> 00:53:11.720
A2 You're not going to use P -,
M by P you're going to use a 1

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10919-0
00:53:07.919 --> 00:53:08.079
And.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10931-1
00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:13.069
-, A, two clear.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10941-0
00:53:12.599 --> 00:53:14.329
Doing, yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10948-0
00:53:14.069 --> 00:53:15.969
What I -, J.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10946-0
00:53:14.939 --> 00:53:16.649
No, I didn't get the matrix
part.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10973-0
00:53:16.659 --> 00:53:19.009
Sorry, can you explain how did
we get this matrix?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10983-0
00:53:17.749 --> 00:53:22.132
When I'll come to the next part,
I'll come to the matrix part,

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10983-1
00:53:22.132 --> 00:53:22.549
right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10989-0
00:53:22.659 --> 00:53:22.919
Even.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10992-0
00:53:22.689 --> 00:53:24.909
So one one second one.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10994-0
00:53:23.319 --> 00:53:23.499
No.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/10996-0
00:53:24.919 --> 00:53:25.339
So what is?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11008-0
00:53:25.289 --> 00:53:26.159
What does it mean?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11020-0
00:53:25.389 --> 00:53:26.459
A1 And what is A2?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11026-0
00:53:26.169 --> 00:53:27.669
A1 Yeah, yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11015-0
00:53:27.049 --> 00:53:27.279
I'll.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11021-0
00:53:27.289 --> 00:53:28.199
I'll come to that.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11028-0
00:53:28.249 --> 00:53:29.119
I'll come to that.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11043-0
00:53:29.269 --> 00:53:32.841
Right, so now you understood
that the matrix is computed

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11043-1
00:53:32.841 --> 00:53:34.659
using two different formulas.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11045-0
00:53:34.729 --> 00:53:35.189
Is that clear?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11064-0
00:53:38.139 --> 00:53:41.469
Two different formula means you
are talking about that last one.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11055-0
00:53:38.509 --> 00:53:38.669
Yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11068-0
00:53:41.779 --> 00:53:42.369
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11094-0
00:53:41.999 --> 00:53:44.319
That is the nominal attribute,
no?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11097-0
00:53:42.279 --> 00:53:45.009
Last one last one.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11071-0
00:53:42.419 --> 00:53:42.789
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11080-0
00:53:42.799 --> 00:53:44.209
Maybe, maybe, maybe.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11082-0
00:53:44.219 --> 00:53:44.529
Miss.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11088-0
00:53:44.779 --> 00:53:45.509
Miss jangiti.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11090-0
00:53:45.559 --> 00:53:45.799
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11092-0
00:53:45.809 --> 00:53:45.959
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11098-0
00:53:45.969 --> 00:53:46.209
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11101-0
00:53:46.219 --> 00:53:47.029
Just hold on.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11122-0
00:53:47.039 --> 00:53:48.809
Maybe I will explain I I think.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11106-0
00:53:47.209 --> 00:53:47.499
I'll.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11139-0
00:53:47.509 --> 00:53:49.769
I'll just take one more second
set too.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11124-0
00:53:48.819 --> 00:53:49.569
OK, Miss Jenny.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11128-0
00:53:49.579 --> 00:53:49.969
Thank you.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11130-0
00:53:50.019 --> 00:53:50.329
I'll.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11136-0
00:53:50.339 --> 00:53:50.969
I'll just.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11144-0
00:53:51.079 --> 00:53:51.809
I'll just hold on.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11151-0
00:53:51.999 --> 00:53:54.079
I think Miss Manisha is asking
more questions.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11173-0
00:53:54.089 --> 00:53:56.799
So, Miss Manisha, you still have
doubts, so let me explain.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11195-0
00:53:56.529 --> 00:53:59.587
No, I I think there are
questions coming from other

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11195-1
00:53:59.587 --> 00:54:00.469
ladies as well.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11191-0
00:54:00.019 --> 00:54:00.949
OK, no problem.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11209-0
00:54:00.539 --> 00:54:02.479
I I'm asking the questions, Sir.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11200-0
00:54:00.959 --> 00:54:02.109
If others others have the.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11207-0
00:54:02.989 --> 00:54:03.979
Yeah, missed some shot.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11240-0
00:54:03.439 --> 00:54:03.799
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11214-0
00:54:03.989 --> 00:54:05.039
You want to ask the question?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11218-0
00:54:05.049 --> 00:54:05.659
Yeah, go ahead.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11234-0
00:54:05.669 --> 00:54:06.599
Go ahead and ask the question.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11238-0
00:54:06.559 --> 00:54:08.409
I want to know how did we get
the matrix.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11264-0
00:54:08.419 --> 00:54:11.269
Sir, I got understood how the
how are we getting the norm?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11262-0
00:54:09.259 --> 00:54:09.599
Thank you.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11250-0
00:54:09.519 --> 00:54:09.809
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11257-0
00:54:09.819 --> 00:54:10.049
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11259-0
00:54:10.099 --> 00:54:10.629
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11267-0
00:54:10.739 --> 00:54:11.649
OK, OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11287-0
00:54:11.669 --> 00:54:13.019
But how are getting matrix?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11270-0
00:54:11.759 --> 00:54:11.979
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11277-0
00:54:11.989 --> 00:54:12.489
You're missing.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11282-0
00:54:13.419 --> 00:54:13.939
No, no, miss.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11292-0
00:54:13.949 --> 00:54:15.529
Some shot, so just keep on.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11304-0
00:54:15.539 --> 00:54:18.389
Be patiently say yes or no to
everything I say.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11315-0
00:54:18.459 --> 00:54:21.009
OK, I'm going to slowly tell you
one by one.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11328-0
00:54:21.379 --> 00:54:25.949
So you are clear that there is a
ranking ranking in the.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11354-0
00:54:26.199 --> 00:54:29.930
This is clear right there is a
test scores have a ranking and

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11354-1
00:54:29.930 --> 00:54:32.999
that can be represented
mathematically using this.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11359-0
00:54:33.209 --> 00:54:34.539
That is clear, right, Miss
Shamshad?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11364-0
00:54:36.469 --> 00:54:36.969
No home.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11399-0
00:54:36.979 --> 00:54:41.659
So I'm clear about the norm is
getting by the formula ah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11381-0
00:54:39.539 --> 00:54:40.209
No, no, no.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11384-0
00:54:40.219 --> 00:54:41.109
Don't go to north.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11394-0
00:54:41.119 --> 00:54:42.109
Don't go to north, I said.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11407-0
00:54:42.119 --> 00:54:43.639
The rank rank is clear.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11422-0
00:54:44.379 --> 00:54:46.509
Land is something which we
assigned right 123.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11438-0
00:54:46.649 --> 00:54:51.432
No, no, I'm saying whether is it
clear to you or not, it is clear

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11434-0
00:54:50.109 --> 00:54:50.289
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11438-1
00:54:51.432 --> 00:54:52.519
it is assigned.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11448-0
00:54:52.529 --> 00:54:55.319
Yeah, that is right because the
rank exists.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11465-0
00:54:55.329 --> 00:54:58.375
That is what we we think that
the variable has a rank existing

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11465-1
00:54:58.375 --> 00:54:58.859
within it.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11493-0
00:54:59.069 --> 00:55:01.771
So when we say the size is
small, medium and large, we

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11493-1
00:55:01.771 --> 00:55:04.571
don't say that the distance
between medium and large and

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11493-2
00:55:04.571 --> 00:55:05.799
small and large are same.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11521-0
00:55:05.849 --> 00:55:08.717
That is, that is the intent, so
the ranking exists, so all we

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11521-1
00:55:08.717 --> 00:55:11.539
are saying is that we have put
the ranking in a number form.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11554-0
00:55:11.649 --> 00:55:15.300
So number form is fine with you
when we put the ranking in

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11536-0
00:55:13.959 --> 00:55:14.159
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11554-1
00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:18.950
number form then what we use is
that we use The Jets score

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11547-0
00:55:16.939 --> 00:55:17.139
Well.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11554-2
00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:20.559
formula for normalization.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11572-0
00:55:22.309 --> 00:55:25.149
Miss Shamshad, you can see The
Jets score formula right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11575-0
00:55:24.909 --> 00:55:25.309
Right.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11598-0
00:55:25.749 --> 00:55:29.959
The maximum is 3 here, minimum
is 1, here one is anyway used as

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11586-0
00:55:28.859 --> 00:55:29.069
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11598-1
00:55:29.959 --> 00:55:32.459
the minimum, so that one is
standard.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11618-0
00:55:32.869 --> 00:55:36.704
So we are saying that for every
rank I'm going to create a judge

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11618-1
00:55:36.704 --> 00:55:38.179
score using this formula.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11623-0
00:55:38.189 --> 00:55:39.659
That is called normalized score.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11633-0
00:55:40.049 --> 00:55:41.509
So this is same aged score.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11644-0
00:55:43.019 --> 00:55:43.239
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11660-0
00:55:43.149 --> 00:55:47.654
So now the jet school for
excellent is 1 and for fail it

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11660-1
00:55:47.654 --> 00:55:48.049
is 0.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11686-0
00:55:48.059 --> 00:55:52.338
Miss Numpad is a clear why the
excellent is 1 and fade is 0.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11673-0
00:55:49.729 --> 00:55:50.229
Yeah. So.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11686-1
00:55:52.338 --> 00:55:52.759
Right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11689-0
00:55:53.419 --> 00:55:53.719
Right.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11693-0
00:55:54.069 --> 00:55:54.279
Right.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11706-0
00:55:54.559 --> 00:55:59.369
OK, so now what we are saying is
that forget about PM&amp;P.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11725-0
00:55:59.459 --> 00:56:03.009
We are saying that distance
between one and two is directly

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11725-1
00:56:03.009 --> 00:56:05.789
the distance that we should put
in the matrix.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11746-0
00:56:06.239 --> 00:56:09.123
So what we have done is that
distance between one and two we

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11746-1
00:56:09.123 --> 00:56:10.399
have put it in the metrics.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11762-0
00:56:10.989 --> 00:56:14.256
Similarly, distance between one
three has to be put in this

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11762-1
00:56:14.256 --> 00:56:15.399
position, column 1/3.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11799-0
00:56:15.899 --> 00:56:19.967
Is it clear Miss Shamshad and
3/4 again we are putting the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11799-1
00:56:19.967 --> 00:56:24.035
distance .5 because that we
directly computed the distance

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11799-2
00:56:24.035 --> 00:56:25.069
mishad is that?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11810-0
00:56:24.459 --> 00:56:27.739
Said that, uh, this is service.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11833-0
00:56:26.899 --> 00:56:30.729
So you're considering that row
wise you're subtracting the.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11849-0
00:56:29.749 --> 00:56:33.871
No, no, don't go to always
columnwise Don wise column wise

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11849-1
00:56:33.871 --> 00:56:37.993
every every element in the
distance matrix is representing

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11849-2
00:56:37.993 --> 00:56:39.739
the distance I, J, right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11881-0
00:56:40.149 --> 00:56:43.375
So if you have got element IJ
that is representing the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11881-1
00:56:43.375 --> 00:56:45.839
distance between element I and
element J.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11913-0
00:56:46.229 --> 00:56:49.588
So in our case the range is
1234, so I said the three four

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11893-0
00:56:46.399 --> 00:56:47.299
But in the formula.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11913-1
00:56:49.588 --> 00:56:53.174
element is representing distance
between third element and 4th

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11913-2
00:56:53.174 --> 00:56:53.629
element.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11918-0
00:56:56.409 --> 00:56:57.559
So one minute.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11921-0
00:56:57.629 --> 00:56:57.899
What?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11924-0
00:56:57.909 --> 00:56:58.759
One minute, Sir.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11963-0
00:56:58.769 --> 00:57:03.944
I want to understand here what
are the attributes so test rank

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11951-0
00:57:03.889 --> 00:57:05.959
That attitude is the test score.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11963-1
00:57:03.944 --> 00:57:07.559
we are giving normalized we are
giving huh.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11958-0
00:57:06.069 --> 00:57:06.809
Just one minute.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11971-0
00:57:06.819 --> 00:57:09.979
The attribute name is a test
score, nothing else.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11979-0
00:57:10.289 --> 00:57:11.819
Others are derived attributes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11984-0
00:57:10.579 --> 00:57:12.539
Only test OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/11987-0
00:57:11.829 --> 00:57:13.649
Rank and norm are derived
attributes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12017-0
00:57:14.589 --> 00:57:18.970
OK, OK, so attribute our test
and on basis of that we are

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12017-1
00:57:18.970 --> 00:57:22.369
calculating we are calculating
the distance.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12011-0
00:57:21.289 --> 00:57:22.099
Yeah, absolutely.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12020-0
00:57:22.149 --> 00:57:23.899
Right, right, right, right.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12070-0
00:57:23.339 --> 00:57:29.048
OK, so so if I'm just talking
about the second one, I 2nd row

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12070-1
00:57:29.048 --> 00:57:34.664
1.0 whatever it is coming so you
are calculating what is the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12070-2
00:57:34.664 --> 00:57:38.439
value of our at that time R is
11 minus.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12066-0
00:57:37.579 --> 00:57:39.249
No, it does not matter once.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12102-0
00:57:39.379 --> 00:57:42.674
See, once you got the normalized
score, the rank is actually it

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12102-1
00:57:42.674 --> 00:57:45.866
is already absorbed because this
one is coming because we are

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12102-2
00:57:45.866 --> 00:57:47.719
comparing these two elements
right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12127-0
00:57:48.649 --> 00:57:51.800
The first student normalized
score is one and second student

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12127-1
00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:55.106
normally score is 0 so that is
why we are getting a distance of

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12127-2
00:57:55.106 --> 00:57:55.209
1.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12134-0
00:57:58.709 --> 00:58:00.379
Sir, can I try this?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12136-0
00:58:00.749 --> 00:58:01.159
Actually.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12150-0
00:58:01.169 --> 00:58:04.499
See the rank which we are giving
one to three.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12166-0
00:58:04.829 --> 00:58:06.969
The same thing we are trying to
normalize.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12158-0
00:58:05.429 --> 00:58:05.979
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12160-0
00:58:06.039 --> 00:58:06.539
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12170-0
00:58:06.649 --> 00:58:08.659
OK, friend, just one minute.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12174-0
00:58:08.739 --> 00:58:10.479
A friend just one minute.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12181-0
00:58:10.489 --> 00:58:11.009
Who is talking?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12214-0
00:58:12.559 --> 00:58:16.840
I who is Mr Vinay, do you want
to answer the question or do you

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12188-0
00:58:12.619 --> 00:58:13.509
Yeah, this is Vinay.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12214-1
00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:18.379
want to ask a question?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12206-0
00:58:18.179 --> 00:58:18.659
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12237-0
00:58:18.669 --> 00:58:21.879
I just want to answer that we
are normalizing proportionate.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12226-0
00:58:20.269 --> 00:58:21.159
No, no, please hold.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12230-0
00:58:21.169 --> 00:58:21.799
Please hold.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12240-0
00:58:21.869 --> 00:58:23.119
Please hold just one minute.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12245-0
00:58:22.749 --> 00:58:23.179
Yeah, sure.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12252-0
00:58:23.209 --> 00:58:26.069
I you can, you can come in just
one minute.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12271-0
00:58:26.129 --> 00:58:30.839
I because I I think there is a
who is who still has a doubt.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12282-0
00:58:30.849 --> 00:58:32.389
Is it Miss Shamshad or somebody
else?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12289-0
00:58:32.839 --> 00:58:33.979
Surbhi surbhi, Sir.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12290-0
00:58:34.869 --> 00:58:35.759
Sort of emissary.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12294-0
00:58:35.769 --> 00:58:36.079
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12299-0
00:58:36.119 --> 00:58:37.339
Is it still you?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12305-0
00:58:36.359 --> 00:58:36.539
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12314-0
00:58:37.349 --> 00:58:38.619
Do you still have some doubt?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12322-0
00:58:39.029 --> 00:58:39.699
What is the doubt?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12312-0
00:58:39.149 --> 00:58:39.469
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12318-0
00:58:39.479 --> 00:58:40.319
Yeah, that's yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12333-0
00:58:40.329 --> 00:58:43.187
Yeah, that's the thing I'm
asking that how you are

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12333-1
00:58:43.187 --> 00:58:43.859
calculating.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12372-0
00:58:43.869 --> 00:58:47.901
I am just confused with the
formula where you have written R

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12359-0
00:58:47.879 --> 00:58:48.239
No, no.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12372-1
00:58:47.901 --> 00:58:50.809
So what will be the value of
R&amp;M's huh?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12366-0
00:58:49.399 --> 00:58:50.859
See, he miss?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12369-0
00:58:50.869 --> 00:58:51.229
Should be.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12374-0
00:58:51.239 --> 00:58:52.309
Just listen to me first.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12382-0
00:58:52.319 --> 00:58:53.209
Listen to me first.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12390-0
00:58:52.879 --> 00:58:53.719
Yeah. OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12401-0
00:58:53.279 --> 00:58:56.609
There is only one attribute we
are considering which is the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12401-1
00:58:56.609 --> 00:58:58.329
test score for that test score.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12420-0
00:58:58.339 --> 00:59:01.212
We are computing the rank
because we can always write the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12420-1
00:59:01.212 --> 00:59:02.549
them in the form of a rank.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12437-0
00:59:02.839 --> 00:59:05.855
So this is a derived attribute
rank and norm is a further

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12437-1
00:59:05.855 --> 00:59:06.999
derived from the rank.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12452-0
00:59:07.099 --> 00:59:11.152
So we are actually computing the
distance based on the test score

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12452-1
00:59:11.152 --> 00:59:11.889
Miss Surbhi.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12460-0
00:59:11.899 --> 00:59:14.149
So just please understand only
one attribute.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12474-0
00:59:14.219 --> 00:59:15.219
Do you still have some doubt?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12472-0
00:59:15.949 --> 00:59:16.859
Ah no.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12482-0
00:59:16.869 --> 00:59:18.619
So test is code means you are
telling.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12505-0
00:59:18.629 --> 00:59:20.609
Excellent, fair, good,
excellent. Right.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12491-0
00:59:19.959 --> 00:59:20.199
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12501-0
00:59:20.209 --> 00:59:22.109
Yeah, that test score is a test
grade.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12524-0
00:59:22.119 --> 00:59:24.771
You may say it is this instead
of score, you call it a grade.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12524-1
00:59:24.771 --> 00:59:24.899
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12533-0
00:59:25.769 --> 00:59:28.179
Test grade grade means
normalized one.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12537-0
00:59:27.009 --> 00:59:27.199
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12547-0
00:59:28.359 --> 00:59:29.199
Oh, no, no.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12575-0
00:59:28.959 --> 00:59:32.728
No, no, that's the grade we are
giving fair good and excellent

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12554-0
00:59:32.149 --> 00:59:32.479
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12562-0
00:59:32.489 --> 00:59:32.909
Yeah, that's.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12575-1
00:59:32.728 --> 00:59:36.497
and that we have converted into
ranks because the data science

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12570-0
00:59:35.399 --> 00:59:35.829
Hmm.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12575-2
00:59:36.497 --> 00:59:39.189
requires some distance
discrimination power.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12596-0
00:59:39.419 --> 00:59:41.823
So we convert it into rank
because finally we have to put

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12596-1
00:59:41.823 --> 00:59:43.149
it into some number form, right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12616-0
00:59:43.419 --> 00:59:46.197
Discrimination is always number
wise, that is, that is how most

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12608-0
00:59:43.809 --> 00:59:44.159
Hmm.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12616-1
00:59:46.197 --> 00:59:47.109
of the time it works.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12646-0
00:59:47.599 --> 00:59:50.695
So we had to convert it into a
number and then we convert it

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12629-0
00:59:48.189 --> 00:59:48.579
Umm.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12646-1
00:59:50.695 --> 00:59:53.029
into jet score and then we
computed distance.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12652-0
00:59:53.359 --> 00:59:55.329
Miss Surbhi, are we with me?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12657-0
00:59:54.649 --> 00:59:55.029
So what?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12670-0
00:59:55.819 --> 00:59:57.999
Or have a am I missing
something?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12679-0
00:59:58.239 --> 01:00:00.339
Can you can you go back to slide
Sir?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12691-0
01:00:01.159 --> 01:00:05.469
I will go back to the slide, but
you have to point out exactly.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12700-0
01:00:05.579 --> 01:00:07.089
So this is the test grade.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12710-0
01:00:06.749 --> 01:00:10.809
So just just how you calculated
the 1.0.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12775-0
01:00:10.889 --> 01:00:15.869
Can you write that that distance
D12, huh? Umm.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12725-0
01:00:11.809 --> 01:00:13.639
Like, OK, OK, I will do that.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12740-0
01:00:13.649 --> 01:00:15.559
I will do that just one minute,
Miss Ruby.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12745-0
01:00:15.569 --> 01:00:16.179
Just hold on.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12756-0
01:00:16.729 --> 01:00:20.059
So so for student one so it.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12769-0
01:00:20.069 --> 01:00:23.319
So let me let me let me Miss
Surbhi, you just keep answering.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12777-0
01:00:23.329 --> 01:00:23.819
Yes or no.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12795-0
01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:28.308
When I explain OK for student
one, you agree the test grade is

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12791-0
01:00:26.099 --> 01:00:26.399
Sure.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12795-1
01:00:28.308 --> 01:00:29.019
excellent.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12818-0
01:00:29.209 --> 01:00:33.173
So with the rank that we can
give is the maximum that is 3,

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12818-1
01:00:33.173 --> 01:00:35.419
the rank is increasing order
123.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12847-0
01:00:35.479 --> 01:00:39.526
OK, so the maximum rank three
and then the formula for jet

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12847-1
01:00:39.526 --> 01:00:43.229
score, you are able to see the
formula for jet score.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12868-0
01:00:43.319 --> 01:00:47.250
So that formula is 1 Miss Surbhi
is are these things clear for

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12868-1
01:00:47.250 --> 01:00:47.999
student one?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12873-0
01:00:49.019 --> 01:00:50.409
Yeah, for the student. It is.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12878-0
01:00:49.539 --> 01:00:50.039
Excellent.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12895-0
01:00:50.649 --> 01:00:54.299
Yeah, it is 3 -, 1, and what
will be the M?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12892-0
01:00:53.819 --> 01:00:54.449
No, no, no.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12904-0
01:00:54.459 --> 01:00:57.669
Don't put the very the CC is not
existing on the screen.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12912-0
01:00:57.679 --> 01:00:58.809
Please can you repeat what is?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12920-0
01:00:58.819 --> 01:00:59.539
What is that you want to?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12922-0
01:01:00.379 --> 01:01:00.909
No, no.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12944-0
01:01:00.979 --> 01:01:05.873
Uh, I am telling that you are
talking about formula, so R is

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12944-1
01:01:05.873 --> 01:01:07.959
clear, R is three, 3 -, 1.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12983-0
01:01:07.969 --> 01:01:12.408
We are doing it is coming to,
but whatever the value what

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12983-1
01:01:12.408 --> 01:01:17.076
value will come for matches MM,
F -, 1 the below denominator

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13011-0
01:01:16.369 --> 01:01:20.327
Yummy is the maximum rank
maximum rank that is 3 maximum

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12987-0
01:01:16.679 --> 01:01:17.959
Ms MS3.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/12983-2
01:01:17.076 --> 01:01:17.459
side.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13011-1
01:01:20.327 --> 01:01:22.549
number of ranks number of ranks.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13004-0
01:01:20.799 --> 01:01:21.489
He managed to.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13007-0
01:01:21.799 --> 01:01:22.749
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13009-0
01:01:22.799 --> 01:01:23.549
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13015-0
01:01:23.559 --> 01:01:24.699
OK, OK, got it.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13023-0
01:01:24.709 --> 01:01:25.999
Got it, got it.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13030-0
01:01:27.029 --> 01:01:27.459
All right.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13035-0
01:01:27.249 --> 01:01:27.859
Got it.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13032-0
01:01:27.509 --> 01:01:28.079
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13037-0
01:01:28.129 --> 01:01:28.619
Got it.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13043-0
01:01:28.169 --> 01:01:28.469
Thank you.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13040-0
01:01:28.629 --> 01:01:29.079
Thank you.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13049-0
01:01:29.089 --> 01:01:29.469
Thank you.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13054-0
01:01:30.039 --> 01:01:32.449
So MF always remains to be 3,
right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13058-0
01:01:30.439 --> 01:01:30.669
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13073-0
01:01:32.459 --> 01:01:33.609
Because that's the maximum.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13063-0
01:01:32.899 --> 01:01:33.449
No, no.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13093-0
01:01:33.459 --> 01:01:35.799
If there is a, if there is
another examination with five

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13093-1
01:01:35.799 --> 01:01:37.359
grades, you're going to get 5,
right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13121-0
01:01:38.059 --> 01:01:39.969
No, but in this specific example
it is 3.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13137-0
01:01:38.559 --> 01:01:42.399
I mean, people, what you have to
pick exam. Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13114-0
01:01:39.979 --> 01:01:40.789
You guys are example.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13128-0
01:01:40.799 --> 01:01:42.139
It is 3 yeah, because there are.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13153-0
01:01:41.989 --> 01:01:46.409
Yet, well, it is constant here
for one question.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13147-0
01:01:42.149 --> 01:01:43.949
There are only three possible
grades.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13143-0
01:01:42.349 --> 01:01:43.129
Yeah, yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13161-0
01:01:43.959 --> 01:01:44.479
Ranks in.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13167-0
01:01:46.009 --> 01:01:46.189
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13391-0
01:01:46.419 --> 01:01:50.019
It is constant for one matrix it
is constant. Uh.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13180-0
01:01:47.919 --> 01:01:50.864
No one one week for each
attribute it changes for each

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13180-1
01:01:50.864 --> 01:01:51.989
attribute it changes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13202-0
01:01:52.079 --> 01:01:55.188
So in your in your employee
database there are 10

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13202-1
01:01:55.188 --> 01:01:56.929
designations and you have a.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13215-0
01:01:56.979 --> 01:02:00.199
You are a strictly hierarchical
organization, 1234 it goes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13224-0
01:02:00.379 --> 01:02:01.859
So when you compute, there is a.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13232-0
01:02:01.869 --> 01:02:02.869
Umm is equal to 10.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13250-0
01:02:02.919 --> 01:02:05.070
Again, you need to do a
normalization for all the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13250-1
01:02:05.070 --> 01:02:06.919
designations using the umm is
equal to 10.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13265-0
01:02:10.659 --> 01:02:11.459
So I have a question.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13267-0
01:02:11.059 --> 01:02:11.379
Yeah, yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13261-0
01:02:11.089 --> 01:02:11.469
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13272-0
01:02:12.359 --> 01:02:14.029
Yes, Miss Shamshad has a
question.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13278-0
01:02:14.039 --> 01:02:14.479
Yeah, go ahead.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13289-0
01:02:15.389 --> 01:02:18.528
So I mean right now we calculate
only for one particular

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13289-1
01:02:18.528 --> 01:02:19.079
attribute.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13303-0
01:02:19.209 --> 01:02:22.349
Can we have multiple attributes
in similar original fashion?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13298-0
01:02:19.629 --> 01:02:19.769
Yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13306-0
01:02:23.289 --> 01:02:23.699
Yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13316-0
01:02:24.209 --> 01:02:26.809
Yeah, we have to do for each
attribute independently, right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13352-0
01:02:29.029 --> 01:02:32.970
Also, we'll get uh for each
particular uh, we'll get

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13352-1
01:02:32.970 --> 01:02:36.019
multiple matrix then, but one
attribute.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13363-0
01:02:34.939 --> 01:02:37.977
Yeah, we can get multiple
matrixes and since the matrix

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13363-1
01:02:37.977 --> 01:02:40.309
size is same, if we wish we can
add right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13374-0
01:02:42.029 --> 01:02:42.439
I mean.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13378-0
01:02:42.299 --> 01:02:44.099
Because the matrix size is
identical, right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13387-0
01:02:44.389 --> 01:02:47.739
Currently we have this whatever
matrix we got.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13394-0
01:02:47.749 --> 01:02:49.089
It is for only one attribute.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13407-0
01:02:50.169 --> 01:02:52.648
Yeah, currently my current
matrix is only for first

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13407-1
01:02:52.648 --> 01:02:53.459
attribute, right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13415-0
01:02:53.469 --> 01:02:53.989
One attribute.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13426-0
01:02:53.739 --> 01:02:57.780
But if I have 3 ordinal
variables, I'll be having 3

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13426-1
01:02:57.780 --> 01:02:58.479
matrices.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13428-0
01:02:59.689 --> 01:03:00.339
Absolutely yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13434-0
01:03:01.309 --> 01:03:01.589
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13442-0
01:03:02.309 --> 01:03:05.239
It, Sir, one question like the
same.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13448-0
01:03:05.249 --> 01:03:06.999
Let me continue the same
question.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13465-0
01:03:07.209 --> 01:03:11.069
If you have two parameters it we
need to add it this this like

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13465-1
01:03:11.069 --> 01:03:11.559
example.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13497-0
01:03:11.569 --> 01:03:14.796
If there is a both the
differences are point 5.5 so it

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13497-1
01:03:14.796 --> 01:03:17.729
will be one or we have to create
another metrics.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13507-0
01:03:18.369 --> 01:03:20.739
No, we will see how what to do
it, how to combine.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13535-0
01:03:20.749 --> 01:03:23.815
We have not come to that, but
The thing is, what I'm saying is

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13525-0
01:03:22.729 --> 01:03:22.929
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13535-1
01:03:23.815 --> 01:03:26.444
when the metrics are of
identical size, we can have a

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13535-2
01:03:26.444 --> 01:03:26.979
mechanisms.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13553-0
01:03:27.069 --> 01:03:29.693
It simple addition is also
possible, but they can be more

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13553-1
01:03:29.693 --> 01:03:30.779
complex mechanisms also.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13554-0
01:03:31.829 --> 01:03:32.279
Sure, Sir.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13575-0
01:03:35.009 --> 01:03:38.239
Or after additions or we can
divide each element by two.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13608-0
01:03:38.249 --> 01:03:42.169
It will again become a 01
matrix, yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13582-0
01:03:39.839 --> 01:03:40.209
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13591-0
01:03:40.219 --> 01:03:41.429
Yeah, we can do that
normalization.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13601-0
01:03:41.439 --> 01:03:42.729
So what you are concerned about?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13603-0
01:03:42.739 --> 01:03:43.219
Zero to one.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13627-0
01:03:43.229 --> 01:03:46.431
Yeah, we will find ways to keep
it, but sometimes we may even

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13617-0
01:03:45.159 --> 01:03:45.639
Yeah, sure.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13627-1
01:03:46.431 --> 01:03:47.309
violate 0 to one.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13644-0
01:03:47.319 --> 01:03:50.585
We go and go for zero to five
because our intention is again a

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13644-1
01:03:50.585 --> 01:03:52.089
discrimination, nothing more.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13651-0
01:03:52.139 --> 01:03:53.519
So so zero to 1.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13708-0
01:03:53.529 --> 01:03:57.208
We'll try to keep it at that is
the how the authors have done it

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13708-1
01:03:57.208 --> 01:04:00.716
mostly 0 to one, but then that
is not a any Bible saying that

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13708-2
01:04:00.716 --> 01:04:04.112
it has to be 0 to and it can
very well be zero to three and

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13708-3
01:04:04.112 --> 01:04:06.149
still you will get the same
result.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13712-0
01:04:06.159 --> 01:04:07.219
Same discriminating power.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13716-0
01:04:08.249 --> 01:04:08.689
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13722-0
01:04:08.699 --> 01:04:11.179
So we will go further, we'll go
further.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13737-0
01:04:13.589 --> 01:04:14.699
So now we have.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13741-0
01:04:13.649 --> 01:04:17.739
Sir, I have one concern in this
slide.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13747-0
01:04:17.329 --> 01:04:17.469
Yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13762-0
01:04:17.789 --> 01:04:21.459
Can you please go back to that
slide? Yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13758-0
01:04:19.769 --> 01:04:21.099
Go to the previous slide.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13764-0
01:04:21.149 --> 01:04:22.269
OK, this slide right.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13781-0
01:04:23.929 --> 01:04:26.509
Yes, here in the the.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13775-0
01:04:24.749 --> 01:04:25.809
Please confirm this slide.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13786-0
01:04:25.819 --> 01:04:26.149
Yes, yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13783-0
01:04:26.519 --> 01:04:27.039
Yes, yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13811-0
01:04:27.449 --> 01:04:33.762
Here in the two comma one, I
think we have to put like 0.0 -,

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13811-1
01:04:33.762 --> 01:04:34.169
1.0.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13822-0
01:04:35.199 --> 01:04:37.949
Yeah, but you take the distance
is always absolute.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13848-0
01:04:36.769 --> 01:04:39.989
Just yes, it's modulus is there.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13826-0
01:04:37.959 --> 01:04:38.609
Absolute.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13869-0
01:04:38.679 --> 01:04:41.372
So when you say the distance
between Hyderabad to Delhi is

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13850-0
01:04:39.999 --> 01:04:40.799
So no issue.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13869-1
01:04:41.372 --> 01:04:43.927
1000 kilometers, we need to
Hyderabad also becomes 1000

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13861-0
01:04:41.879 --> 01:04:42.219
Yes, yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13869-2
01:04:43.927 --> 01:04:44.429
kilometers.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13884-0
01:04:43.959 --> 01:04:48.219
Umm, it's more than this one
hour perfecting, yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13886-0
01:04:45.589 --> 01:04:48.259
Yeah, distance is absolutely.
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13893-0
01:04:51.039 --> 01:04:51.509
Alright.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13897-0
01:04:51.349 --> 01:04:52.179
OK. Thank.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13898-0
01:04:51.519 --> 01:04:52.579
So we'll proceed further.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13901-0
01:04:53.609 --> 01:04:54.039
So.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13924-0
01:04:54.049 --> 01:04:57.399
So, Sir, once after we plotting
that matrix, what do we do next?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13919-0
01:04:56.989 --> 01:04:57.139
Yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13922-0
01:04:58.329 --> 01:04:58.919
What do we do?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13925-0
01:04:58.929 --> 01:04:59.199
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13930-0
01:04:59.209 --> 01:05:00.579
Yeah, just be patient.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13932-0
01:05:00.589 --> 01:05:00.889
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13938-0
01:05:00.969 --> 01:05:01.899
Yeah, we'll lose some.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13950-0
01:05:01.909 --> 01:05:04.279
We'll do a few more things, but
let's be patient, OK?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13957-0
01:05:05.009 --> 01:05:05.219
Look.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13958-0
01:05:05.579 --> 01:05:06.779
Because we need to get the.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13978-0
01:05:06.839 --> 01:05:11.094
See what we said is that when
you have two employees, some

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/13978-1
01:05:11.094 --> 01:05:12.969
attributes may be ordinal.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14011-0
01:05:12.979 --> 01:05:17.187
For example, designation, you
may treat it as ordinal, but

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14011-1
01:05:17.187 --> 01:05:21.751
then some other thing like the
language of the person you treat

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14011-2
01:05:21.751 --> 01:05:23.249
it as a as a nominal.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14022-0
01:05:23.539 --> 01:05:25.669
So we have to have a mechanism
to combine.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14025-0
01:05:25.679 --> 01:05:26.379
We'll come to that.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14032-0
01:05:26.389 --> 01:05:27.899
We'll come to the mechanisms to
combine.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14042-0
01:05:30.619 --> 01:05:33.229
OK, so we are proceeding little
further.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14053-0
01:05:33.419 --> 01:05:36.694
So so there are multiple
attributes, so multiple

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14053-1
01:05:36.694 --> 01:05:37.429
attributes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14060-0
01:05:37.439 --> 01:05:38.369
What is going to happen?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14065-0
01:05:38.379 --> 01:05:39.389
We have tried to.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14077-0
01:05:39.479 --> 01:05:41.149
We have put it in a more compact
way.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14097-0
01:05:41.539 --> 01:05:50.040
So suppose size has got yes LM
and then quality has got war

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14097-1
01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:53.299
fade or excellent fade.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14105-0
01:05:54.579 --> 01:05:56.949
Uh, sorry. Food fade.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14108-0
01:05:57.239 --> 01:05:58.669
Good, excellent.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14116-0
01:05:59.019 --> 01:06:01.909
So there are four possible
values here.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14154-0
01:06:02.139 --> 01:06:06.466
OK, there are three possible
values here, so we are going to

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14154-1
01:06:06.466 --> 01:06:10.864
normalize them and we are going
to get a normalized score for

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14154-2
01:06:10.864 --> 01:06:14.269
each one of the values using the
normalization.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14167-0
01:06:14.279 --> 01:06:16.469
So we are putting them in a
brief form.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14233-0
01:06:16.739 --> 01:06:21.496
So for 4/4 objects, 2 attributes
size and quality and both of

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14233-1
01:06:21.496 --> 01:06:25.793
them are ordinal and size got
three possible values and

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14233-2
01:06:25.793 --> 01:06:30.627
quality got four possible values
and we combine them we we are

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14233-3
01:06:30.627 --> 01:06:35.538
going to normalize site and we
are normalizing quality and this

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14233-4
01:06:35.538 --> 01:06:40.142
is what we get the values within
the brackets or normalized

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14233-5
01:06:40.142 --> 01:06:40.679
values.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14246-0
01:06:41.049 --> 01:06:44.899
So can you take a minute to
absorb it and ask questions?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14252-0
01:06:44.909 --> 01:06:45.959
Now, not even minute.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14266-0
01:06:45.969 --> 01:06:48.399
Maybe I think in 10 SEC or half
a minute you can absorb.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14278-0
01:06:51.389 --> 01:06:53.639
And then you can ask me if there
are doubts.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14312-0
01:06:55.969 --> 01:06:59.243
It is identical to the previous
slide, but we have two

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14312-1
01:06:59.243 --> 01:07:02.457
attributes, so we needed to do
normalization for both

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14312-2
01:07:02.457 --> 01:07:04.659
attributes in an independent
manner.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14319-0
01:07:05.149 --> 01:07:07.189
Normalization for each attribute
is independent.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14329-0
01:07:11.599 --> 01:07:12.749
And how to compute distance?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14333-0
01:07:12.759 --> 01:07:13.289
We'll come to that.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14340-0
01:07:14.199 --> 01:07:15.269
How to compute distance?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14350-0
01:07:15.329 --> 01:07:16.869
How do how do we combine this?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14356-0
01:07:16.919 --> 01:07:17.479
We'll come to that.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14368-0
01:07:18.829 --> 01:07:20.789
So the second point, how did we
arrive at that, Sir?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14370-0
01:07:21.859 --> 01:07:22.499
Quality.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14385-0
01:07:22.509 --> 01:07:24.209
Is it the quality you are
saying?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14386-0
01:07:23.569 --> 01:07:24.719
No, no, no, no, no.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14400-0
01:07:24.729 --> 01:07:27.109
Normalized values of small of
size.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14395-0
01:07:27.089 --> 01:07:27.749
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14398-0
01:07:27.759 --> 01:07:28.339
Right, right.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14420-0
01:07:28.389 --> 01:07:35.379
So so see the the first object A
has size of small and size.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14439-0
01:07:35.389 --> 01:07:39.955
We said is ordinal, so we are
going to assign them ranks of

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14439-1
01:07:39.955 --> 01:07:40.259
123.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14445-0
01:07:40.309 --> 01:07:40.979
Is that clear?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14454-0
01:07:41.449 --> 01:07:42.109
OK, OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14451-0
01:07:41.559 --> 01:07:41.959
Yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14484-0
01:07:41.969 --> 01:07:47.127
Tell them become 123 and then we
used a rank formula that is

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14465-0
01:07:44.009 --> 01:07:44.309
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14477-0
01:07:46.609 --> 01:07:47.399
Got it, got it.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14484-1
01:07:47.127 --> 01:07:49.579
given here to get you get OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14483-0
01:07:47.629 --> 01:07:48.399
Got it. OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14495-0
01:07:55.779 --> 01:07:57.329
So I think it is clear.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14512-0
01:07:57.539 --> 01:08:03.381
So now what can we do is that we
can combine them using Euclidean

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14512-1
01:08:03.381 --> 01:08:04.089
measure.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14535-0
01:08:04.139 --> 01:08:09.706
If we want to keep the distance
as within zero to 1, so we can

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14535-1
01:08:09.706 --> 01:08:12.269
use a Euclidean distance, uh.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14548-0
01:08:12.279 --> 01:08:14.589
I'm sorry, Euclidean distance
does not guarantee it will be.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14561-0
01:08:14.599 --> 01:08:17.309
It is within 01, but then it is
a.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14579-0
01:08:17.319 --> 01:08:22.173
It is 1 popular measure and what
we can do is that we can also

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14579-1
01:08:22.173 --> 01:08:24.099
use a Manhattan distance.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14593-0
01:08:24.109 --> 01:08:26.824
We are going to see what is
Manhattan distance, Manhattan

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14593-1
01:08:26.824 --> 01:08:27.479
distance each.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14595-0
01:08:28.799 --> 01:08:29.939
Simply add.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14617-0
01:08:32.899 --> 01:08:37.467
And you Canadian distance is
like A2 dimensional distance

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14617-1
01:08:37.467 --> 01:08:39.909
object A and object B are here.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14626-0
01:08:40.179 --> 01:08:41.649
How do I compute the distance?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14633-0
01:08:41.659 --> 01:08:43.209
I take this and this.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14701-0
01:08:43.299 --> 01:08:46.988
I'm going to compute the
diagonal so the diagonal is a ^2

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14701-1
01:08:46.988 --> 01:08:51.059
+ b ^2 and root of that, so that
is how we are going to compute

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14701-2
01:08:51.059 --> 01:08:55.067
if we want and we can also have
other distance which I said is

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14701-3
01:08:55.067 --> 01:08:59.074
that simply add the two matrices
so then what we get is called

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14701-4
01:08:59.074 --> 01:09:00.919
Manhattan distance simply at.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14709-0
01:09:01.059 --> 01:09:03.369
So we have to have a mechanism.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14720-0
01:09:03.379 --> 01:09:04.369
So what are the mechanisms?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14734-0
01:09:04.379 --> 01:09:06.948
There are even more mechanisms
we let's not talk about them

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14734-1
01:09:06.948 --> 01:09:07.119
now.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14749-0
01:09:07.779 --> 01:09:12.085
So we combine the distances
after we get the distance for

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14749-1
01:09:12.085 --> 01:09:13.199
each attribute.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14799-0
01:09:13.249 --> 01:09:17.469
In case of ordinal because in
case of a nominal we are getting

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14799-1
01:09:17.469 --> 01:09:21.555
it one stroke, P -, M by P in
ordinal before each attribute,

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14799-2
01:09:21.555 --> 01:09:25.709
we compute the normalized value
for each attribute we get the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14799-3
01:09:25.709 --> 01:09:29.259
distance and then we have a
mechanism to combine it.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14824-0
01:09:31.269 --> 01:09:34.999
So this is the summary of how we
compute the distance for.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14815-0
01:09:33.299 --> 01:09:33.599
Said.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14825-0
01:09:35.439 --> 01:09:35.709
I have.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14830-0
01:09:35.719 --> 01:09:37.029
I have a question, Sir.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14834-0
01:09:37.309 --> 01:09:38.069
Yes, yes, yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14893-0
01:09:38.719 --> 01:09:43.363
OK, actually what is the
reasoning behind to calculate

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14893-1
01:09:43.363 --> 01:09:48.935
the distance like first or being
the nominal be calculated r -, m

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14893-2
01:09:48.935 --> 01:09:53.917
by R and after that in the
second B calculate the distance

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14893-3
01:09:53.917 --> 01:09:58.814
AJ minus AI and now it third B
are following the includin

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14893-4
01:09:58.814 --> 01:09:59.489
formula.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14913-0
01:09:59.759 --> 01:10:03.162
Now, what is the reasoning
behind how you decided that this

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14913-1
01:10:03.162 --> 01:10:03.389
one?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14924-0
01:10:03.399 --> 01:10:06.359
I'm going to calculate the
distance by this method.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14932-0
01:10:07.209 --> 01:10:09.679
OK, Mr VISHAL, let me put it
this way.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14937-0
01:10:09.969 --> 01:10:11.399
So now you are.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14956-0
01:10:11.409 --> 01:10:16.608
You have to sell a gadget and
your company says that find the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14956-1
01:10:16.608 --> 01:10:17.279
maximum.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14972-0
01:10:17.289 --> 01:10:21.590
Find the best possible customers
for whom who are likely to buy

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/14972-1
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:22.329
the gadget.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15015-0
01:10:22.769 --> 01:10:26.515
So now your immediate intention
is that you need to find a

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15015-1
01:10:26.515 --> 01:10:30.452
discriminating way to because
they they your company gave out

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15015-2
01:10:30.452 --> 01:10:34.580
database of 10,00,000 people in
the city and you have to sell an

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15015-3
01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:35.659
expensive gadget.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15027-0
01:10:36.079 --> 01:10:38.409
So now you have to differentiate
the people.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15039-0
01:10:38.969 --> 01:10:40.069
Mr Vishal, are you with me?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15048-0
01:10:42.629 --> 01:10:43.229
Yes, yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15054-0
01:10:43.169 --> 01:10:44.609
This, Mr VISHAL, are you with
me?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15067-0
01:10:45.109 --> 01:10:46.829
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm
following you.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15098-0
01:10:46.429 --> 01:10:49.522
Because you understood the
problem, your company needs to

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15098-1
01:10:49.522 --> 01:10:52.509
sell a gadget which is an
expensive or fancy gadget and

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15098-2
01:10:52.509 --> 01:10:55.976
you got lot of attributes about
1,000,000 people that are living

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15098-3
01:10:55.976 --> 01:10:56.669
in your city.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15112-0
01:10:57.179 --> 01:11:00.289
So now you have to have a
focused marketing.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15105-0
01:10:57.279 --> 01:10:57.559
Umm.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15136-0
01:11:00.699 --> 01:11:04.093
So you want to identify who are
the people who are likely to

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15136-1
01:11:04.093 --> 01:11:06.987
buy, and then you think that
many attributes make a

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15136-2
01:11:06.987 --> 01:11:07.599
difference.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15149-0
01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:10.479
So you need to have a mechanism
to combine them.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15154-0
01:11:10.529 --> 01:11:11.649
A miss Mr VIKAS.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15162-0
01:11:11.659 --> 01:11:12.699
VISHAL, are you with me?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15176-0
01:11:12.789 --> 01:11:15.069
So you have to find a mechanism
to combine.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15174-0
01:11:12.859 --> 01:11:13.179
Yeah, yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15201-0
01:11:15.229 --> 01:11:18.387
I'm not saying that I have
already given you a mechanism to

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15201-1
01:11:18.387 --> 01:11:21.388
combine, but I'm saying that
some possible mechanisms to

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15201-2
01:11:21.388 --> 01:11:21.809
combine.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15213-0
01:11:22.489 --> 01:11:22.989
Yeah. True.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15215-0
01:11:24.659 --> 01:11:24.869
True.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15224-0
01:11:25.039 --> 01:11:26.169
Mr VISHAL, you are with me.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15219-0
01:11:26.129 --> 01:11:26.529
Yeah, yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15222-0
01:11:26.539 --> 01:11:26.919
Yes, Sir.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15228-0
01:11:26.929 --> 01:11:27.289
Yes, Sir.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15238-0
01:11:27.939 --> 01:11:30.069
OK, so now we have come done.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15242-0
01:11:30.079 --> 01:11:32.689
The two nominal and ordinal.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15265-0
01:11:32.769 --> 01:11:35.334
So let us take break for five
minutes and then we'll talk

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15265-1
01:11:35.334 --> 01:11:36.749
about other types of attributes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15260-0
01:11:35.419 --> 01:11:35.609
So.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15267-0
01:11:37.179 --> 01:11:38.259
So I doubt.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15275-0
01:11:39.389 --> 01:11:39.529
Yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15283-0
01:11:40.559 --> 01:11:42.489
And it just got it back to that
previous slide.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15290-0
01:11:42.539 --> 01:11:43.959
You kleidion distance.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15306-0
01:11:44.959 --> 01:11:47.859
Previous slide is this slide or
another slide.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15310-0
01:11:48.279 --> 01:11:49.249
This one, this one.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15320-0
01:11:49.479 --> 01:11:50.169
This one, yes, yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15314-0
01:11:49.579 --> 01:11:50.809
How did we? Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15326-0
01:11:50.819 --> 01:11:52.909
How did we calculate this
distance measure?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15335-0
01:11:54.239 --> 01:11:56.889
Ohh, why did we take a a
diagonal measure?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15362-0
01:11:56.959 --> 01:12:02.326
So you know, you know, when we
have a, we have a the this is

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15362-1
01:12:02.326 --> 01:12:06.109
actually coming from a simple
graph major.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15374-0
01:12:06.119 --> 01:12:10.069
Suppose that you have a point
here, which is a.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15398-0
01:12:10.079 --> 01:12:16.524
Let us say this is 21, OK and
this is representing one point

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15398-1
01:12:16.524 --> 01:12:20.539
and I have another point which
is 55.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15407-0
01:12:21.039 --> 01:12:23.409
So I need to compute the
distance between the two.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15446-0
01:12:23.659 --> 01:12:28.699
So what I'm going to do is that
I'm going to compute the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15446-1
01:12:28.699 --> 01:12:34.447
distance, that's why minus 2 ^2
plus uh and 5 -, 1, ^2, and then

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15446-2
01:12:34.447 --> 01:12:36.569
take the square root of.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15460-0
01:12:37.019 --> 01:12:38.869
This is the hypotenuse formula.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15468-0
01:12:38.879 --> 01:12:42.039
Diagonal formula Miss Shamshad
you have doubt about this one.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15483-0
01:12:44.699 --> 01:12:46.599
Umm, OK, so I've got it.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15479-0
01:12:47.169 --> 01:12:47.519
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15509-0
01:12:47.529 --> 01:12:50.579
So that is the way because this
is called, you know the right

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15509-1
01:12:50.579 --> 01:12:53.579
angle triangle, we compute the
distance along one dimension,

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15509-2
01:12:53.579 --> 01:12:55.399
the other dimension, and we
combine.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15523-0
01:12:55.729 --> 01:12:59.179
That is the diagonal as the
distance, so this is 1 approach.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15532-0
01:12:59.359 --> 01:13:01.439
And as I said, this is not the
only approach.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15537-0
01:13:01.449 --> 01:13:02.279
So just hold it.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15546-0
01:13:02.289 --> 01:13:03.869
So this is 1 possible approach.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15564-0
01:13:05.169 --> 01:13:07.139
So that can you go back to the
slide once?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15568-0
01:13:08.339 --> 01:13:09.609
They go to the slide again, yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15573-0
01:13:11.289 --> 01:13:12.489
Not this one higher.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15583-0
01:13:13.989 --> 01:13:15.999
Alright, so let us take the
break.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15588-0
01:13:15.199 --> 01:13:15.739
Ohh.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15598-0
01:13:16.009 --> 01:13:18.799
So so you can possibly review
the slide.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15637-0
01:13:18.889 --> 01:13:23.329
I'm putting that I'm giving a
break to others so so you can

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15637-1
01:13:23.329 --> 01:13:28.213
let us take a 5 minute break and
I'm going to open that slide and

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15637-2
01:13:28.213 --> 01:13:31.839
you can absorb or ask questions
after the break.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15643-0
01:13:32.139 --> 01:13:33.409
Michelle, Chad is there trait?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15655-0
01:13:35.169 --> 01:13:35.569
Yes, so.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15651-0
01:13:36.199 --> 01:13:36.789
It is fake.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15653-0
01:13:36.799 --> 01:13:37.049
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15657-0
01:13:37.059 --> 01:13:37.609
Thank you.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15664-0
01:13:37.759 --> 01:13:39.939
So I'm leaving this slide open
and.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15770-0
01:17:47.729 --> 01:17:49.779
OK, let's get restarted.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15774-0
01:17:49.849 --> 01:17:50.239
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15792-0
01:17:50.289 --> 01:17:55.896
So question from Mr Srinivas is
that can I explain that table

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15792-1
01:17:55.896 --> 01:17:56.439
again?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15800-0
01:17:56.729 --> 01:17:58.189
Mr Srinivas, can you speak?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15797-0
01:17:59.019 --> 01:17:59.249
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15801-0
01:17:59.259 --> 01:17:59.649
Yeah, Sir.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15810-0
01:17:59.659 --> 01:18:01.129
So I was talking about.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15812-0
01:18:00.419 --> 01:18:00.639
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15835-0
01:18:01.599 --> 01:18:03.629
I was talking about this one
from that table to.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15829-0
01:18:01.699 --> 01:18:04.009
Yes, yes, yes, Mr Cinemas.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15837-0
01:18:04.019 --> 01:18:05.249
Just just listen to me.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15851-0
01:18:05.259 --> 01:18:06.809
Maybe that clarifies.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15856-0
01:18:06.919 --> 01:18:10.745
So you take now there are two
independent attributes called

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15856-1
01:18:10.745 --> 01:18:11.829
size and quality.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15909-0
01:18:11.879 --> 01:18:16.149
So size you can take it as ex
and quality as Y or vice versa

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15909-1
01:18:16.149 --> 01:18:20.489
doesn't matter and now you take
them, you plot them as if you

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15909-2
01:18:20.489 --> 01:18:24.759
are plotting them on a graph and
then you try to compute the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15909-3
01:18:24.759 --> 01:18:29.169
distance using the right angle
formula that we have hypotenuse

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15909-4
01:18:29.169 --> 01:18:29.729
formula.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15929-0
01:18:30.319 --> 01:18:34.747
So which is the which is called
in in mathematics sizes

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15929-1
01:18:34.747 --> 01:18:36.249
Euclidean distance.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15977-0
01:18:37.139 --> 01:18:40.696
So as as we are going to see
little later, there are many

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15977-1
01:18:40.696 --> 01:18:44.621
types of distances, but for time
being letters take one example

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15977-2
01:18:44.621 --> 01:18:48.485
Euclidean distance which is very
common which we have which we

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15977-3
01:18:48.485 --> 01:18:50.999
which we which is often very
often used.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/15989-0
01:18:52.419 --> 01:18:56.129
So the in Mr Srinivas, am I
missing something?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16005-0
01:18:56.179 --> 01:18:57.339
Or please ask what is it?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16002-0
01:18:56.629 --> 01:18:59.059
No, no, no, no, no, you are not
missing, Sir.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16010-0
01:18:59.069 --> 01:19:00.139
So I'm I'm clear now.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16022-0
01:19:00.709 --> 01:19:02.539
Can you go back to the previous
slide please?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16024-0
01:19:00.849 --> 01:19:01.489
OK, good.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16038-0
01:19:02.909 --> 01:19:03.689
One slide back.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16028-0
01:19:03.069 --> 01:19:03.339
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16047-0
01:19:03.349 --> 01:19:05.995
Yeah, I'll go back to which
slide this slide are previous

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16047-1
01:19:05.995 --> 01:19:06.269
slide.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16052-0
01:19:07.559 --> 01:19:08.599
Uh, slide 15.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16054-0
01:19:09.689 --> 01:19:10.909
Slide 15, OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16063-0
01:19:16.119 --> 01:19:17.219
OK, OK, I'm good now.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16065-0
01:19:17.969 --> 01:19:18.319
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16084-0
01:19:18.329 --> 01:19:23.271
Alright, so now we'll go to
proceed with new attribute type

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16084-1
01:19:23.271 --> 01:19:26.319
which is which is binary
attributes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16105-0
01:19:26.629 --> 01:19:29.083
So binary attributes, some
people may say that it is a

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16105-1
01:19:29.083 --> 01:19:30.779
specialization of nominal
attributes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16114-0
01:19:30.789 --> 01:19:31.879
No, nothing wrong with that.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16125-0
01:19:32.039 --> 01:19:36.999
But binary attributes are more
common in many domains.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16131-0
01:19:37.349 --> 01:19:40.349
For example, you may do.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16148-0
01:19:40.629 --> 01:19:43.149
Sometimes there may be an
executive medical checkup that

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16148-1
01:19:43.149 --> 01:19:43.989
you may go through.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16183-0
01:19:44.069 --> 01:19:48.130
So in that case, they're going
to make 150 tests and all the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16183-1
01:19:48.130 --> 01:19:52.325
tests the results can be treated
as a binary saying that is it

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16183-2
01:19:52.325 --> 01:19:54.389
coming as a normal or abnormal.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16189-0
01:19:54.739 --> 01:19:55.859
So that becomes a binary.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16198-0
01:19:55.869 --> 01:19:57.039
Forget about all the numbers.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16210-0
01:19:57.519 --> 01:20:00.389
So in that case you have got a
large number of variables.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16219-0
01:20:00.399 --> 01:20:01.889
It is a binary variables.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16251-0
01:20:01.899 --> 01:20:05.832
Many times tend to be large
numbers and then we need to make

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16251-1
01:20:05.832 --> 01:20:09.701
a comparison of data objects
based on many binary variables

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16251-2
01:20:09.701 --> 01:20:10.539
that we have.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16258-0
01:20:11.599 --> 01:20:14.819
Someone know within seven the
basic problem?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16285-0
01:20:16.219 --> 01:20:19.612
Uh, so we are calculating
distance using different methods

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16285-1
01:20:19.612 --> 01:20:23.407
and how to interpret the results
of for the practical application

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16285-2
01:20:23.407 --> 01:20:23.809
I mean.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16290-0
01:20:25.069 --> 01:20:26.739
Mr Vijaykanth, you are.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16310-0
01:20:26.749 --> 01:20:30.649
You are asking me how will we
use these distances, right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16322-0
01:20:31.349 --> 01:20:34.112
You know, for the particular
application, so the trying to

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16322-1
01:20:34.112 --> 01:20:35.329
find the the combinations.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16329-0
01:20:35.339 --> 01:20:36.839
What is the best possible
combinations?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16350-0
01:20:36.929 --> 01:20:38.859
No, can be a used for.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16341-0
01:20:38.219 --> 01:20:39.009
No, no, we will.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16354-0
01:20:39.019 --> 01:20:41.049
We will come to the see the
practical applications.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16377-0
01:20:41.059 --> 01:20:45.260
These are all practical because
because many times we need to do

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16377-1
01:20:45.260 --> 01:20:47.069
a, we need to do a grouping.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16402-0
01:20:47.119 --> 01:20:51.093
That example bank may say that
segment the customers so that we

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16402-1
01:20:51.093 --> 01:20:54.259
will assign suitable ranked
relationship managers.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16416-0
01:20:54.629 --> 01:20:57.961
So somebody becomes a platinum
customer, somebody becomes a

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16416-1
01:20:57.961 --> 01:20:58.739
gold customer.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16425-0
01:20:58.849 --> 01:21:00.219
So these are all practical.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16443-0
01:21:00.229 --> 01:21:02.742
So in that case they need to
consider the attributes that

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16443-1
01:21:02.742 --> 01:21:04.519
they consider maybe different
from ours.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16478-0
01:21:04.609 --> 01:21:07.761
So if you give me your domain
example, we can do that, maybe

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16478-1
01:21:07.761 --> 01:21:10.759
in webinar or something, but
then this is the this is the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16478-2
01:21:10.759 --> 01:21:13.239
method is not going to be any
different, right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16484-0
01:21:13.979 --> 01:21:14.689
Hi, Mr vikant.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16491-0
01:21:14.169 --> 01:21:14.349
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16489-0
01:21:14.779 --> 01:21:15.239
Didn't know.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16495-0
01:21:15.299 --> 01:21:16.249
Are we missing something?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16507-0
01:21:17.299 --> 01:21:19.249
Nothing that you're populating
distance, right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16516-0
01:21:19.259 --> 01:21:21.429
So can you just give an example?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16527-0
01:21:21.439 --> 01:21:24.829
OK, how to use the distance
value?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16636-0
01:21:24.959 --> 01:21:28.116
What you're getting right, so
how to convert that as a

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16551-0
01:21:26.399 --> 01:21:28.129
How do you use the distance
values?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16636-1
01:21:28.116 --> 01:21:28.919
practical, uh.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16563-0
01:21:28.339 --> 01:21:29.849
How do you use the distance
values?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16566-0
01:21:29.859 --> 01:21:30.719
It's simple.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16584-0
01:21:30.779 --> 01:21:33.396
See first thing is that you have
done a discrimination by

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16584-1
01:21:33.396 --> 01:21:34.659
creating the distance right.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16617-0
01:21:35.099 --> 01:21:38.736
You have created a
discrimination saying that, say

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16617-1
01:21:38.736 --> 01:21:43.301
you can say that if you compare
the distance of Chennai, Bombay

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16617-2
01:21:43.301 --> 01:21:47.509
and Delhi say that bombai is
closer to Chennai than Delhi.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16628-0
01:21:47.959 --> 01:21:50.269
So you created the
discrimination how to use it?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16667-0
01:21:50.279 --> 01:21:53.969
We'll see because they there are
many applications where we can

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16672-0
01:21:51.469 --> 01:21:51.869
Ohh.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16667-1
01:21:53.969 --> 01:21:57.544
use it, but first, the first
purpose of creating the distance

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16667-2
01:21:57.544 --> 01:22:01.119
is to create a discrimination
with very complex data objects.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16673-0
01:22:01.209 --> 01:22:01.949
A Mr vijaykanth.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16690-0
01:22:01.959 --> 01:22:04.089
Are we In Sync so with?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16683-0
01:22:02.929 --> 01:22:03.459
Yes, I know.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16696-0
01:22:03.469 --> 01:22:03.919
Thank you.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16706-0
01:22:04.139 --> 01:22:07.057
Because at this distance we are
talking about Chennai to Delhi

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16706-1
01:22:07.057 --> 01:22:08.169
is finally it is simple.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16724-0
01:22:08.539 --> 01:22:11.747
You are measuring both of them
in a single one variable that is

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16724-1
01:22:11.747 --> 01:22:12.349
a kilometer.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16732-0
01:22:12.359 --> 01:22:14.089
So one is 2000, another is 1000.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16753-0
01:22:14.099 --> 01:22:17.631
OK, so but then we were dealing
with complex objects which have

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16753-1
01:22:17.631 --> 01:22:18.679
got 100 attributes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16756-0
01:22:18.689 --> 01:22:20.159
So we still need to
discriminate.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16758-0
01:22:21.469 --> 01:22:21.939
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16765-0
01:22:22.449 --> 01:22:22.709
Thank you.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16763-0
01:22:22.719 --> 01:22:24.249
Alright, OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16773-0
01:22:24.299 --> 01:22:25.849
So we are proceeding further.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16782-0
01:22:26.159 --> 01:22:28.589
Suppose that there are some
binary attributes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16793-0
01:22:28.799 --> 01:22:31.049
So what do we do with the binary
attributes?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16821-0
01:22:31.279 --> 01:22:36.341
So binary attributes the way
we'll go about is that suppose

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16821-1
01:22:36.341 --> 01:22:39.969
we have binary attributes where
let's say.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16831-0
01:22:40.039 --> 01:22:42.647
Let me simplify this so
attribute 1 attribute 2

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16831-1
01:22:42.647 --> 01:22:43.299
attribute 3.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16843-0
01:22:48.289 --> 01:22:50.579
Attribute to attribute 3.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16860-0
01:22:50.649 --> 01:22:55.176
So all I'm saying is that I'm
going to give all of them as 10

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16860-1
01:22:55.176 --> 01:22:55.979
attributes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16878-0
01:22:55.989 --> 01:23:00.448
So either one or zero fine
because binary, so I can call

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16878-1
01:23:00.448 --> 01:23:01.309
them as 10.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16907-0
01:23:01.499 --> 01:23:07.021
So now I'm saying object one, so
this has got an attribute value

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16907-1
01:23:07.021 --> 01:23:10.589
of 1 here 0 here and one here
object two.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16918-0
01:23:10.679 --> 01:23:13.889
This has got a 0 here, 0 here
and one here.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16929-0
01:23:14.299 --> 01:23:18.369
Object Three is having one here,
one here and zero here.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16951-0
01:23:18.759 --> 01:23:22.945
So now I want to compute the
distance among the the data

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16951-1
01:23:22.945 --> 01:23:25.589
objects based on binary
attributes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16969-0
01:23:25.839 --> 01:23:30.353
So what I need to do is that so
far distance between one and

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16969-1
01:23:30.353 --> 01:23:30.649
two.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16980-0
01:23:33.069 --> 01:23:34.759
Distance between one and two.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16984-0
01:23:35.209 --> 01:23:36.399
I can rewrite this.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/16999-0
01:23:36.409 --> 01:23:41.719
This is same thing as distance
between one and two is equal to.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17011-0
01:23:42.129 --> 01:23:46.179
I can treat in simple way as P
-.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17030-0
01:23:46.369 --> 01:23:51.045
M by Pi can do that because
there are three attributes, and

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17030-1
01:23:51.045 --> 01:23:53.149
among them two are matched.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17042-0
01:23:53.469 --> 01:23:57.779
So the distance I'm going to get
is to one by three, right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17061-0
01:23:58.389 --> 01:24:02.784
So that that can be one approach
and another approach is that we

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17061-1
01:24:02.784 --> 01:24:04.609
treat the piece separately.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17073-0
01:24:04.619 --> 01:24:07.789
And sorry, the one separately
and 0 separately.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17080-0
01:24:08.059 --> 01:24:10.949
So I'm going to do that saying
that.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17095-0
01:24:10.959 --> 01:24:14.439
How many ones are matched and
how many zeros are matched?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17106-0
01:24:14.519 --> 01:24:17.669
So now I'm going to create a
matrix.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17114-0
01:24:17.679 --> 01:24:19.719
So what I'm doing, I'm going to
create.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17128-0
01:24:30.289 --> 01:24:32.809
I'm going to create saying that
object one.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17138-0
01:24:37.459 --> 01:24:39.019
And object two.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17152-0
01:24:40.239 --> 01:24:43.869
So I'm saying that there are
some one some zeros here.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17158-0
01:24:43.879 --> 01:24:45.389
Someone sum zeros here.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17183-0
01:24:45.779 --> 01:24:50.571
What I'm saying that there is
there are objects, both of them

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17183-1
01:24:50.571 --> 01:24:54.899
are one with only one situation
so that is attribute 3.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17191-0
01:24:56.999 --> 01:24:58.569
And attribute 3.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17230-0
01:24:58.579 --> 01:25:05.000
Both of them have the one so
object one is 1 and object two

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17230-1
01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:11.849
is 0 width attribute 1 so that
is again one and object two is 1

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17230-2
01:25:11.849 --> 01:25:13.989
but object one is 0.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17259-0
01:25:13.999 --> 01:25:19.901
There are no such attributes and
there is one attribute 2 where

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17259-1
01:25:19.901 --> 01:25:24.419
both of them are you getting
these numbers 1011.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17267-0
01:25:24.699 --> 01:25:28.129
I'm trying to compare object two
with object one.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17280-0
01:25:30.639 --> 01:25:31.819
And what I'm doing is.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17281-0
01:25:31.029 --> 01:25:31.909
So can you please repeat?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17288-0
01:25:34.029 --> 01:25:35.519
OK, OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17296-0
01:25:36.389 --> 01:25:39.199
So object one and object two.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17314-0
01:25:39.209 --> 01:25:44.626
So all I am doing is I am
computing how many times both of

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17314-1
01:25:44.626 --> 01:25:45.819
them are one.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17322-0
01:25:46.829 --> 01:25:47.909
Who is this Miss Shamshad?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17336-0
01:25:49.869 --> 01:25:50.429
Yes, Sir.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17330-0
01:25:50.819 --> 01:25:51.229
Miss them?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17332-0
01:25:51.239 --> 01:25:51.489
Check.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17355-0
01:25:51.539 --> 01:25:54.874
So can you tell me looking at
these two objects, object one

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17355-1
01:25:54.874 --> 01:25:57.819
and object two, how many times
both of them are one?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17369-0
01:26:00.219 --> 01:26:00.779
One time.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17377-0
01:26:01.299 --> 01:26:03.489
One so that is what we are going
to put here.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17403-0
01:26:04.079 --> 01:26:08.161
So that is what is we can say
let us say that is Q number of

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17403-1
01:26:08.161 --> 01:26:11.039
times that is both of them are
equal to 1.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17470-0
01:26:18.309 --> 01:26:23.511
OK, so how many times object one
has got a one, but object two

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17470-1
01:26:23.511 --> 01:26:28.713
has got zero so again one right
so that we are putting it here

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17470-2
01:26:28.713 --> 01:26:33.502
so that we can call it by a
separate variable and then we

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17470-3
01:26:33.502 --> 01:26:38.786
are calling another one which is
object one is 0 but object two

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17470-4
01:26:38.786 --> 01:26:39.199
is 1.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17489-0
01:26:39.409 --> 01:26:44.049
So there are no such cases so
that we are yes is equal to 0

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17489-1
01:26:44.049 --> 01:26:46.059
and both of them are zero.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17494-0
01:26:46.449 --> 01:26:47.659
Both of them are zero.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17515-0
01:26:47.669 --> 01:26:53.352
There is one so that is P so we
can create a cross tabulation so

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17515-1
01:26:53.352 --> 01:26:53.789
this.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17539-0
01:26:59.819 --> 01:27:05.132
For for comparing only the
binary attributes of two data

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17539-1
01:27:05.132 --> 01:27:09.979
objects can you can you just try
to absorb is that?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17576-0
01:27:14.839 --> 01:27:19.335
So we have to form this matrix
for all the attributes like 1-2,

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17576-1
01:27:19.335 --> 01:27:20.599
then 2-3 then 3/4.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17572-0
01:27:21.319 --> 01:27:21.649
No, no.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17574-0
01:27:21.659 --> 01:27:22.219
Just one minute.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17582-0
01:27:22.229 --> 01:27:23.569
Yes, yes, not attributes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17601-0
01:27:23.579 --> 01:27:26.997
All the objects right for each
object we need to do that for

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17600-0
01:27:25.609 --> 01:27:25.829
Other.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17601-1
01:27:26.997 --> 01:27:27.669
each object.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17606-0
01:27:27.679 --> 01:27:28.719
We need to do that.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17616-0
01:27:28.859 --> 01:27:31.569
Essentially it will become a
formula in in due course.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17620-0
01:27:31.579 --> 01:27:32.089
We'll see.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17649-0
01:27:32.399 --> 01:27:36.850
It is becoming a formula because
total number of attributes is P

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17649-1
01:27:36.850 --> 01:27:40.411
OK, B is total number of
attribute and how many are

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17658-0
01:27:37.279 --> 01:27:37.489
Hey.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17649-2
01:27:40.411 --> 01:27:40.959
matches.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17673-0
01:27:41.229 --> 01:27:47.229
Matches are Q + B, right Q + P
or representing the matches and

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17673-1
01:27:47.229 --> 01:27:51.229
R Plus yes, is representing the
mismatch.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17697-0
01:27:49.799 --> 01:27:49.909
I.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17681-0
01:27:51.499 --> 01:27:53.529
So P is sum of all of this.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17708-0
01:27:53.629 --> 01:27:59.208
So if do you call this as a Yum,
so the formula is going to be P

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17708-1
01:27:59.208 --> 01:28:01.869
-, M by P the distance formula.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17711-0
01:28:05.149 --> 01:28:05.499
Uh.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17730-0
01:28:16.429 --> 01:28:18.399
So we will write it this way.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17732-0
01:28:16.449 --> 01:28:17.559
And what is M?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17763-0
01:28:18.449 --> 01:28:23.042
We will write the distance as R
Plus is equal to R Plus is equal

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17763-1
01:28:23.042 --> 01:28:26.999
to P, -, M because R Plus is
representing the distance.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17761-0
01:28:26.819 --> 01:28:28.169
Said what is M?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17774-0
01:28:28.479 --> 01:28:29.319
What is M?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17792-0
01:28:28.809 --> 01:28:32.351
Yummies matches that we have
seen in the nominal attributes,

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17792-1
01:28:32.351 --> 01:28:35.719
just to ensure that we are not
using a different concept.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17788-0
01:28:32.889 --> 01:28:33.169
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17804-0
01:28:36.269 --> 01:28:37.819
Yum is a nominal attributes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17803-0
01:28:36.809 --> 01:28:37.479
OK, OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17815-0
01:28:37.829 --> 01:28:40.459
When we you can remember, I will
go back to that slide.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17827-0
01:28:43.169 --> 01:28:46.229
So we talked about this P -, M
by P, right.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17841-0
01:28:50.859 --> 01:28:53.059
This is the first type of
attribute we have seen today.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17851-0
01:28:54.649 --> 01:28:56.249
Some nominal attributes are.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17884-0
01:28:57.129 --> 01:29:01.398
I mean we understood that then
why don't we go back using the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17884-1
01:29:01.398 --> 01:29:02.569
same P -, N by P?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17878-0
01:29:02.279 --> 01:29:03.649
No, no, we we'll come to that.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17892-0
01:29:03.659 --> 01:29:05.529
Why we needed to do a little
difference?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17950-0
01:29:05.539 --> 01:29:09.481
There are some differences we'll
come to that, but what we are

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17910-0
01:29:07.379 --> 01:29:07.899
OK, OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17950-1
01:29:09.481 --> 01:29:13.548
saying is that the distance is R
Plus yes where where one object

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17950-2
01:29:13.548 --> 01:29:17.364
is 1 and other object is 0 or
vice versa and total number of

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17950-3
01:29:17.364 --> 01:29:21.056
attributes is QR plus plus T
that you can write it as P if

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17950-4
01:29:21.056 --> 01:29:21.619
you wish.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17985-0
01:29:23.229 --> 01:29:27.459
So this is representing the
distance, but the only trick is

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17985-1
01:29:27.459 --> 01:29:31.971
that here this is representing a
symmetric binary dissimilarity

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17985-2
01:29:31.971 --> 01:29:36.272
that is both one and 0 have
equal importance with respect to

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/17985-3
01:29:36.272 --> 01:29:37.259
the attribute.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18002-0
01:29:38.719 --> 01:29:43.529
But uh, I hope it is clear the
distance formula.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18015-0
01:29:44.589 --> 01:29:47.869
So how did we arrive at uh, the
numerator R Plus, yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18016-0
01:29:47.489 --> 01:29:47.619
It's.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18031-0
01:29:48.679 --> 01:29:53.227
R Plus is representing R is
representing when object ID is

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18031-1
01:29:53.227 --> 01:29:54.769
1, object J is zero.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18050-0
01:29:54.779 --> 01:29:58.749
That is, R&amp;S is representing
when object ID 0, object J is

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18050-1
01:29:58.749 --> 01:30:00.639
one you can see in this table.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18053-0
01:30:02.969 --> 01:30:03.389
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18069-0
01:30:06.799 --> 01:30:09.009
Essentially, they are
representing mismatch of the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18069-1
01:30:09.009 --> 01:30:09.789
binary attributes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18072-0
01:30:12.509 --> 01:30:12.999
No.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18092-0
01:30:13.009 --> 01:30:14.749
So what we are saying is that
when they are.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18106-0
01:30:14.099 --> 01:30:17.892
Is that how do we decide like
which two attributes we need to

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18106-1
01:30:17.892 --> 01:30:18.809
take like DI J.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18133-0
01:30:18.819 --> 01:30:22.573
So first row to compare second
or first to third or first to

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18127-0
01:30:22.079 --> 01:30:23.969
No, we have to do it
exhaustively.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18133-1
01:30:22.573 --> 01:30:22.819
4th.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18157-0
01:30:23.979 --> 01:30:27.060
We have to do it for everything,
but because we are going to

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18157-1
01:30:27.060 --> 01:30:29.939
write it as a formula, we the
machine will do it 1 by 1.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18160-0
01:30:29.949 --> 01:30:30.369
So.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18178-0
01:30:30.439 --> 01:30:33.101
So the point is that when we
understand it, we have to

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18178-1
01:30:33.101 --> 01:30:35.279
understand that any object ID to
any object.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18208-0
01:30:39.139 --> 01:30:43.069
Yeah, but when you create a D
matrix and you compare 2 rows, I

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18198-0
01:30:39.209 --> 01:30:40.109
This is the meeting.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18208-1
01:30:43.069 --> 01:30:44.629
mean couple of rows only.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18215-0
01:30:44.639 --> 01:30:45.759
So how do you derive that?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18241-0
01:30:45.769 --> 01:30:48.909
Which two rows to be compared or
which few rows do we compare?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18231-0
01:30:47.699 --> 01:30:48.809
No speak.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18265-0
01:30:48.989 --> 01:30:52.787
See, The thing is that when you
looked at this matrix, this

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18265-1
01:30:52.787 --> 01:30:55.699
matrix represents every possible
combination.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18269-0
01:30:55.709 --> 01:30:56.309
Don't you see that?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18290-0
01:30:57.639 --> 01:31:00.795
Don't you see that every
possible combination is here, so

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18290-1
01:31:00.795 --> 01:31:03.189
you can take a combination of
four and one.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18303-0
01:31:03.199 --> 01:31:05.629
It is here the combination of
three and two.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18306-0
01:31:05.639 --> 01:31:06.249
It is here.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18311-0
01:31:06.299 --> 01:31:07.059
Everything is there.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18314-0
01:31:08.209 --> 01:31:09.609
The Matrix will capture
everything.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18318-0
01:31:15.999 --> 01:31:16.549
Admin Singh.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18325-0
01:31:18.199 --> 01:31:19.969
That R is a mismatch.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18332-0
01:31:19.979 --> 01:31:21.469
And yes, is also a mismatch.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18361-0
01:31:21.479 --> 01:31:24.689
That's why you're adding R Plus,
yes, in the top and in the.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18353-0
01:31:23.859 --> 01:31:24.609
That is correct.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18357-0
01:31:24.619 --> 01:31:25.309
That is correct.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18363-0
01:31:25.639 --> 01:31:26.509
That is correct, yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18364-0
01:31:26.219 --> 01:31:27.919
OK, OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18378-0
01:31:31.379 --> 01:31:32.499
We're gonna explain the point.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18386-0
01:31:32.509 --> 01:31:35.319
#2 and the people team.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18384-0
01:31:34.169 --> 01:31:35.159
Point #2.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18387-0
01:31:35.289 --> 01:31:36.019
Yes, yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18430-0
01:31:36.089 --> 01:31:43.100
OK, point #2 in which one which
this slide or this slide which

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18446-0
01:31:40.379 --> 01:31:45.210
Yeah, the similarity that is
based on the symmetric one of

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18430-1
01:31:43.100 --> 01:31:44.769
slide point #2?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18446-1
01:31:45.210 --> 01:31:49.059
the current slide only which you
are in, yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18437-0
01:31:48.049 --> 01:31:49.119
OK, OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18439-0
01:31:49.179 --> 01:31:49.739
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18456-0
01:31:49.849 --> 01:31:51.659
Tell me, what is the point #2
can you?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18467-0
01:31:51.709 --> 01:31:52.869
Can you just help me?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18481-0
01:31:52.169 --> 01:31:55.738
This similarity that is based on
the symmetric binary attributes

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18481-1
01:31:55.738 --> 01:31:58.209
is called as symmetric binary
dissimilarity.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18482-0
01:31:58.839 --> 01:31:59.329
Yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18491-0
01:31:59.419 --> 01:32:02.129
So we are not differentiating
one and 0.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18514-0
01:32:02.419 --> 01:32:07.683
So whether it is 1 to 0 or 0 to
one and then one to one and zero

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18514-1
01:32:07.683 --> 01:32:08.169
to 00.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18543-0
01:32:08.179 --> 01:32:12.129
So we are treating one and zero
as equal States and we are

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18543-1
01:32:12.129 --> 01:32:15.409
comparing their similar their
match or mismatch.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18549-0
01:32:15.779 --> 01:32:19.449
But then sometimes there are
attributes for them.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18567-0
01:32:19.599 --> 01:32:23.800
One and 0 cannot be treated in a
symmetric way, so that will come

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18567-1
01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:24.309
to that.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18600-0
01:32:24.459 --> 01:32:28.009
But as of now, we have a
symmetric binary attributes, so

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18600-1
01:32:28.009 --> 01:32:31.933
this is simply saying yes or no
type of attributes and both of

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18600-2
01:32:31.933 --> 01:32:33.739
them are of equal importance.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18608-0
01:32:34.629 --> 01:32:35.879
Is that clear, Miss Inshaat?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18615-0
01:32:36.489 --> 01:32:37.789
That is why we call it
symmetric.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18633-0
01:32:41.639 --> 01:32:43.109
Miss Inshad, please say yes or
no.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18628-0
01:32:43.319 --> 01:32:43.689
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18635-0
01:32:43.699 --> 01:32:45.009
Yeah, I'm trying to understand.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18648-0
01:32:45.019 --> 01:32:48.289
So like what is this similarity
over here?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18663-0
01:32:49.689 --> 01:32:52.819
The dissimilarity between the
object ID and J.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18701-0
01:32:53.049 --> 01:32:56.469
So here we are seeing now
because when object object one

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18701-1
01:32:56.469 --> 01:33:00.309
has got a attribute one as one
and object two has attribute one

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18701-2
01:33:00.309 --> 01:33:03.789
as zero that should represent
some form of dissimilarity.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18709-0
01:33:03.799 --> 01:33:04.159
Is it not?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18722-0
01:33:05.589 --> 01:33:06.979
Reminder difference basically.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18723-0
01:33:07.709 --> 01:33:08.019
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18736-0
01:33:08.029 --> 01:33:10.939
Finally, we'll combine that the
way we are combining is.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18743-0
01:33:10.949 --> 01:33:12.979
First, we are combining all
binary attributes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18777-0
01:33:13.189 --> 01:33:16.051
So what we are taking is that
all attributes are equal and

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18777-1
01:33:16.051 --> 01:33:19.058
then we are taking their they
take and take only two possible

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18777-2
01:33:19.058 --> 01:33:20.319
values either zero or one.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18792-0
01:33:20.749 --> 01:33:24.219
And we started computing the
distance and we got this.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18820-0
01:33:24.279 --> 01:33:28.109
This cross tabulation can store
all the all the differences and

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18820-1
01:33:28.109 --> 01:33:31.580
then we are using the formula
this formula to compute the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18820-2
01:33:31.580 --> 01:33:32.119
distance.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18851-0
01:33:32.829 --> 01:33:36.292
Click on the complete the
metrics for the example which

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18851-1
01:33:36.292 --> 01:33:40.002
you shared for tribute 123 that
will that will give a clear

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18840-0
01:33:37.229 --> 01:33:37.969
Yeah, please.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18851-2
01:33:40.002 --> 01:33:40.929
picture for us.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18852-0
01:33:40.539 --> 01:33:42.649
K OK, OK, alright.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18867-0
01:33:44.829 --> 01:33:50.159
OK, so now now let us look at
let me use a different color.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18876-0
01:33:53.879 --> 01:33:55.549
So the distance matrix.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18882-0
01:33:55.919 --> 01:33:58.109
So this is a three by three.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18903-0
01:33:58.119 --> 01:34:03.963
So anyway, this is 0, so now we
need to compute for one and two

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18903-1
01:34:03.963 --> 01:34:05.059
one and two.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18916-0
01:34:05.069 --> 01:34:10.249
We are seeing that the the
differences are only one right.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18923-0
01:34:10.299 --> 01:34:11.709
This is R Plus, yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18949-0
01:34:12.039 --> 01:34:16.379
So R is 1 and SC0 because there
is no nothing where attribute

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18949-1
01:34:16.379 --> 01:34:18.969
object one is 0 and object two
is 1.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18967-0
01:34:19.339 --> 01:34:22.298
So the difference is only one
and the total number of

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18967-1
01:34:22.298 --> 01:34:23.449
attributes are three.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18977-0
01:34:23.849 --> 01:34:26.659
So we are getting the distance
as one by three.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18987-0
01:34:27.089 --> 01:34:28.129
Is that fine, Miss Shamshad?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19020-0
01:34:28.909 --> 01:34:32.129
Between one and two and now
between one and three.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/18998-0
01:34:30.499 --> 01:34:30.909
Yes, Sir.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19033-0
01:34:30.919 --> 01:34:33.923
If I'm not apply, if I buy
seeing the mattress, I can say

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19033-1
01:34:33.923 --> 01:34:36.771
that there's only one
difference, but we don't have to

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19033-2
01:34:36.771 --> 01:34:37.289
apply the.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19048-0
01:34:38.909 --> 01:34:42.449
Ohh thing which we derived right
TIJ over here.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19052-0
01:34:43.739 --> 01:34:44.409
No, no.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19062-0
01:34:44.479 --> 01:34:46.849
For one and two, you wanted me
to compute.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19069-0
01:34:46.919 --> 01:34:48.509
So what is the queue there?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19075-0
01:34:48.559 --> 01:34:49.829
Q is equal to 1 right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19095-0
01:34:50.869 --> 01:34:54.532
Q is equal to 1 because there is
one attribute for which both of

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19095-1
01:34:54.532 --> 01:34:55.659
them are one, right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19107-0
01:34:56.499 --> 01:35:00.409
So so for object one and object
two.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19100-0
01:34:56.679 --> 01:34:56.849
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19137-0
01:35:00.759 --> 01:35:07.338
So now let us take object one
versus objective object two, no,

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19121-0
01:35:04.639 --> 01:35:04.859
What?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19142-0
01:35:06.499 --> 01:35:08.779
What is cute? What?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19137-1
01:35:07.338 --> 01:35:09.009
just one minute.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19154-0
01:35:09.019 --> 01:35:12.151
Miss Shamshad that I'll just get
the get this object one versus

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19154-1
01:35:12.151 --> 01:35:12.689
object two.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19196-0
01:35:12.959 --> 01:35:17.918
So now we are looking at QQ is
equal to how much one right

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19167-0
01:35:13.419 --> 01:35:13.939
That's all.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19196-1
01:35:17.918 --> 01:35:23.212
because there is one for which
yeah for our object ID is 1 and

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19185-0
01:35:18.289 --> 01:35:19.039
The next song.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19196-2
01:35:23.212 --> 01:35:24.389
object J is 0.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19218-0
01:35:24.479 --> 01:35:28.379
So object one is 1 and object
two is 0 object.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19213-0
01:35:27.799 --> 01:35:28.049
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19224-0
01:35:28.059 --> 01:35:28.439
So one.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19230-0
01:35:28.389 --> 01:35:30.379
One is when this is also one,
right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19240-0
01:35:30.889 --> 01:35:32.979
So R is equal to 1.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19237-0
01:35:31.079 --> 01:35:31.459
Yeah. So.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19267-0
01:35:33.049 --> 01:35:36.742
So yes, is equal to 0 because
there is nothing where object

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19267-1
01:35:36.742 --> 01:35:38.219
two is 1 and object 180.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19275-0
01:35:38.549 --> 01:35:39.879
So yes, is equal to zero.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19279-0
01:35:38.929 --> 01:35:39.539
For example.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19277-0
01:35:40.169 --> 01:35:40.599
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19299-0
01:35:40.729 --> 01:35:44.546
And then T is equal to also one
because both of them are zero

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19299-1
01:35:44.546 --> 01:35:45.839
for our attribute to.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19316-0
01:35:46.149 --> 01:35:50.288
So now we use the formula that
is given here to compute the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19316-1
01:35:50.288 --> 01:35:50.909
distance.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19317-0
01:35:50.289 --> 01:35:50.869
Got it. So.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19330-0
01:35:54.729 --> 01:35:55.409
Is that clear?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19336-0
01:35:55.419 --> 01:35:56.509
Miss Shamshad, this formula.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19343-0
01:35:56.369 --> 01:35:56.869
Yeah. So.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19354-0
01:35:57.629 --> 01:36:00.129
OK, so this will give us a value
of 1 by 3.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19378-0
01:36:00.849 --> 01:36:06.309
So cute queue is a dissimilarity
that the difference.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19373-0
01:36:05.549 --> 01:36:06.719
Give me the similarity.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19402-0
01:36:06.729 --> 01:36:09.752
Q is the similarity so that is
why in the distance formula it

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19402-1
01:36:09.752 --> 01:36:12.629
doesn't come Q is similarity
because both of them are one.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19415-0
01:36:14.489 --> 01:36:16.569
OK and.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19412-0
01:36:16.139 --> 01:36:17.549
So Q is similarity.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19417-0
01:36:17.559 --> 01:36:18.609
Both of them are one, yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19419-0
01:36:21.189 --> 01:36:21.469
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19428-0
01:36:24.409 --> 01:36:27.159
Alright, OK, so so now.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19457-0
01:36:27.209 --> 01:36:32.667
Now what happens is that there
are sometimes the attributes are

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19457-1
01:36:32.667 --> 01:36:37.527
such that we do not care well
when the attribute has a 0

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19457-2
01:36:37.527 --> 01:36:38.039
value.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19468-0
01:36:38.819 --> 01:36:43.239
So now let me let me look at
2/2.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19473-0
01:36:44.199 --> 01:36:45.299
Ohm.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19486-0
01:36:45.579 --> 01:36:51.629
Let me say two documents where
we are considering the keywords.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19504-0
01:36:51.919 --> 01:36:57.962
OK, so our keywords include
million keywords, but then

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19504-1
01:36:57.962 --> 01:37:00.819
document one has keywords.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19509-0
01:37:03.779 --> 01:37:06.429
Document one includes cricket.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19515-0
01:37:08.729 --> 01:37:10.829
OK, then India.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19520-0
01:37:12.579 --> 01:37:13.509
And Pakistan?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19528-0
01:37:16.499 --> 01:37:20.719
And the document 2 includes
cricket.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19532-0
01:37:23.759 --> 01:37:24.129
India.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19535-0
01:37:26.019 --> 01:37:26.979
And England?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19544-0
01:37:29.739 --> 01:37:33.039
So now we want to compute the.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19562-0
01:37:33.099 --> 01:37:39.165
This is the this so we have got
a we have got a lexicon lexicon

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19562-1
01:37:39.165 --> 01:37:39.639
with.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19570-0
01:37:42.869 --> 01:37:45.709
With uh 100,000 keywords.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19592-0
01:37:47.579 --> 01:37:50.666
So what we are saying is that
these are the only important

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19592-1
01:37:50.666 --> 01:37:52.549
keywords that we are interested
in.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19608-0
01:37:52.819 --> 01:37:57.870
So now we are saying that the
cricket present here cricket is

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19608-1
01:37:57.870 --> 01:37:58.929
present here.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19613-0
01:37:59.239 --> 01:38:00.409
India is present here.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19616-0
01:38:00.419 --> 01:38:01.109
Present here.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19635-0
01:38:01.319 --> 01:38:04.813
Pakistan is present here, but
Pakistan is 0 here and England

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19635-1
01:38:04.813 --> 01:38:05.729
is present here.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19641-0
01:38:05.739 --> 01:38:07.449
But England is 0 in document
one.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19669-0
01:38:07.859 --> 01:38:12.157
So now there are 999 thousand
other keywords which do not

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19669-1
01:38:12.157 --> 01:38:16.529
matter when we are comparing
document one to document two.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19686-0
01:38:16.939 --> 01:38:22.915
So then what we say is that we
will consider all QRS and we

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19686-1
01:38:22.915 --> 01:38:24.309
will ignore T.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19695-0
01:38:25.229 --> 01:38:26.199
We will ignore it.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19704-0
01:38:27.729 --> 01:38:30.459
So so we are saying that ignore
me.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19724-0
01:38:33.929 --> 01:38:37.584
And then we'll get a formula
which is called as asymmetric

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19724-1
01:38:37.584 --> 01:38:38.699
binary attributes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19737-0
01:38:38.999 --> 01:38:42.865
So what we say is that the
presence count absence is

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19737-1
01:38:42.865 --> 01:38:43.449
ignored.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19750-0
01:38:48.329 --> 01:38:51.699
So so this is a symmetric binary
dissimilarity.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19767-0
01:38:51.709 --> 01:38:57.187
We compute using a different
formula which is r + / Q + R

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19767-1
01:38:57.187 --> 01:38:57.659
Plus.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19776-0
01:38:57.669 --> 01:39:02.069
So the denominator got a change
saying that ignore T.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19788-0
01:39:03.999 --> 01:39:05.199
I said, what is that here?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19803-0
01:39:06.169 --> 01:39:12.026
Please, when both of them are 0B
is representing the table where

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19803-1
01:39:12.026 --> 01:39:14.819
both attribute values are zero.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19811-0
01:39:16.459 --> 01:39:17.929
So here, sorry.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19813-0
01:39:16.459 --> 01:39:16.679
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19851-0
01:39:17.939 --> 01:39:22.473
Here you can see P when object
J0 and object I is 0 and what

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19851-1
01:39:22.473 --> 01:39:27.231
this asymmetric binary approach
is saying is that ignore T then

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19851-2
01:39:27.231 --> 01:39:31.691
you get a dissimilarity value
which is called an asymmetric

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19851-3
01:39:31.691 --> 01:39:33.029
binary dissimilar.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19867-0
01:39:35.019 --> 01:39:36.699
We're going to have it when
example please.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19869-0
01:39:37.559 --> 01:39:38.879
No, the example is already
given.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19891-0
01:39:40.949 --> 01:39:44.831
But I mean it is not specific
that what are we ignoring over

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19891-1
01:39:44.831 --> 01:39:45.149
here?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19912-0
01:39:46.149 --> 01:39:49.646
We are ignoring the lexicon has
got 1,000,000 words for which

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19912-1
01:39:49.646 --> 01:39:51.959
both the documents have got zero
values.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19920-0
01:39:52.369 --> 01:39:53.719
So we are ignoring those zeros.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19935-0
01:39:58.739 --> 01:39:59.999
And and though heroes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19946-0
01:39:58.759 --> 01:40:01.924
We are only considering what is
present in both the documents

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19946-1
01:40:01.924 --> 01:40:04.119
and we are ignoring the rest of
the world.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19957-0
01:40:06.269 --> 01:40:08.109
And those zeros represent
teaser.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19959-0
01:40:08.779 --> 01:40:09.849
They represent tea.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19981-0
01:40:13.179 --> 01:40:16.658
Because for example, we are
comparing 2 newspaper articles,

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19981-1
01:40:16.658 --> 01:40:19.789
but we are ignoring the
remaining newspaper articles.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19999-0
01:40:19.799 --> 01:40:22.853
Maybe having many things they
may be having about Narendra

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/19999-1
01:40:22.853 --> 01:40:24.509
Modi, Joe Biden and many things.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20024-0
01:40:24.959 --> 01:40:28.909
But for our documents, they are
not the keywords, so we don't

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20024-1
01:40:28.909 --> 01:40:32.159
consider whether there is zero
there or 1J1 there.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20045-0
01:40:32.979 --> 01:40:37.206
So we are only considering what
both of our documents contain

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20045-1
01:40:37.206 --> 01:40:40.069
and use that that is becoming
new for me.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20051-0
01:40:46.989 --> 01:40:48.429
Alright, OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20055-0
01:40:49.439 --> 01:40:51.459
Then we will proceed little
further.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20079-0
01:40:53.709 --> 01:40:59.081
So so the measurement of
similarity is there is a when

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20079-1
01:40:59.081 --> 01:41:05.039
with when we have a asymmetric
binary similar dissimilarity.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20089-0
01:41:05.449 --> 01:41:08.479
So this is asymmetric binary
dissimilarity.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20093-0
01:41:09.879 --> 01:41:11.049
So sorry.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20097-0
01:41:10.989 --> 01:41:12.129
So, sorry to interrupt.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20102-0
01:41:11.269 --> 01:41:13.269
So yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20123-0
01:41:12.259 --> 01:41:18.308
Uh, here we are talking about
tea and it means that we are

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20123-1
01:41:18.308 --> 01:41:21.589
just keeping the our comparison.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20154-0
01:41:22.059 --> 01:41:25.714
That similarity and this
similarity, if you are talking

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20154-1
01:41:25.714 --> 01:41:29.499
about that as you give an
example of newspaper article or

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20154-2
01:41:29.499 --> 01:41:31.849
something kind of so are we
fixing?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20152-0
01:41:30.479 --> 01:41:30.759
But like.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20190-0
01:41:31.899 --> 01:41:35.649
Are we fixing the rain that
these these area only these

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20190-1
01:41:35.649 --> 01:41:39.399
amount of data or these area of
data we will compare or

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20190-2
01:41:39.399 --> 01:41:40.939
something kind of that?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20193-0
01:41:40.359 --> 01:41:41.829
Hello is anyone speaking?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20204-0
01:41:43.519 --> 01:41:45.549
Missus Surbhi a Mr B.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20203-0
01:41:44.229 --> 01:41:44.439
Yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20208-0
01:41:45.819 --> 01:41:46.409
Yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20223-0
01:41:46.479 --> 01:41:50.242
So we are comparing the what we
want to what are the important

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20223-1
01:41:50.242 --> 01:41:50.899
attributes?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20229-0
01:41:50.909 --> 01:41:52.049
Yes, and we will.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20236-0
01:41:52.059 --> 01:41:53.409
We'll just hold on.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20240-0
01:41:53.299 --> 01:41:53.459
Hello.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20283-0
01:41:53.419 --> 01:41:57.182
I hope if you understood the
formula, we'll proceed further

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20283-1
01:41:57.182 --> 01:42:00.756
and then there is one more
example, maybe that will also

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20283-2
01:42:00.756 --> 01:42:04.832
help, but the attributes are of
course they're dependent defined

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20283-3
01:42:04.832 --> 01:42:06.149
based on the problem.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20309-0
01:42:06.599 --> 01:42:10.771
So so now, now let us let us
look at a little bit, one more

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20309-1
01:42:10.771 --> 01:42:14.109
definition which is called
Jaccard coefficient.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20318-0
01:42:14.779 --> 01:42:17.928
Jaccard coefficient is when we
have asymmetric binary

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20318-1
01:42:17.928 --> 01:42:18.569
attributes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20329-0
01:42:19.999 --> 01:42:23.329
OK, asymmetric binary
attributes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20336-0
01:42:23.759 --> 01:42:27.369
Then we call that as a Jaccard
coefficient.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20353-0
01:42:27.379 --> 01:42:32.157
This is a just a term and
Jaccard coefficient is used in

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20353-1
01:42:32.157 --> 01:42:34.169
many domains to compare.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20381-0
01:42:34.399 --> 01:42:38.794
So now let us say there are
symmetric binary attributes, so

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20381-1
01:42:38.794 --> 01:42:43.189
this is the way we create with
symmetric binary attributes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20393-0
01:42:43.199 --> 01:42:45.349
This is the way we create the
contingency table.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20412-0
01:42:45.859 --> 01:42:49.971
So let us say there are 6
attributes and we are creating a

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20412-1
01:42:49.971 --> 01:42:52.549
contingency table between 2
records.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20417-0
01:42:52.959 --> 01:42:54.569
Record one and record 2.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20431-0
01:42:55.119 --> 01:42:58.198
OK, we are creating a
contingency table between record

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20431-1
01:42:58.198 --> 01:42:59.149
one and record 2.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20466-0
01:42:59.479 --> 01:43:03.562
So we are seeing that how many
times both of them are one that

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20466-1
01:43:03.562 --> 01:43:07.515
is only with respect to the
gender, both of them are one and

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20466-2
01:43:07.515 --> 01:43:09.329
there is no other situation.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20474-0
01:43:09.339 --> 01:43:11.699
They are matching both of them
are one.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20502-0
01:43:12.109 --> 01:43:16.948
So now let us look at when both
of them have got one of them

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20502-1
01:43:16.948 --> 01:43:20.439
object one which is object one
has got one.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20514-0
01:43:21.449 --> 01:43:27.229
Sorry, object one has got zero
and object two has got one.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20523-0
01:43:27.609 --> 01:43:29.439
So we are getting it with food.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20527-0
01:43:29.869 --> 01:43:30.659
We are getting that.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20544-0
01:43:30.669 --> 01:43:36.240
So there is one number of when
object one is 0 and object two

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20544-1
01:43:36.240 --> 01:43:36.689
is 1.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20558-0
01:43:37.319 --> 01:43:41.159
Now let us look at how many
times object two is object.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20569-0
01:43:41.169 --> 01:43:43.809
One is 1 and object two is 0.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20581-0
01:43:44.099 --> 01:43:47.669
So we are seeing with respect to
cast education and hobby.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20629-0
01:43:47.899 --> 01:43:51.754
So we are seeing that three
times we are seeing getting a

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20629-1
01:43:51.754 --> 01:43:55.675
binary attributes 3 binary
attributes where object one has

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20629-2
01:43:55.675 --> 01:43:59.729
got one and object two has zero
and there is one one job for

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20629-3
01:43:59.729 --> 01:44:01.989
which both of them have got
zero.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20644-0
01:44:02.279 --> 01:44:06.371
So 00 is only once, so now we
can use this formula to compute

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20644-1
01:44:06.371 --> 01:44:07.229
the distance.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20653-0
01:44:07.299 --> 01:44:08.919
So which is R Plus divided by
this?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20661-0
01:44:09.609 --> 01:44:11.509
So this is coming 2.67.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20672-0
01:44:14.399 --> 01:44:18.249
OK, now, now let us look at
this.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20707-0
01:44:18.519 --> 01:44:23.013
So with respect to asymmetric
asymmetric, we can take it as a

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20707-1
01:44:23.013 --> 01:44:27.725
problem of sets so many times we
need to compute the distance or

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20707-2
01:44:27.725 --> 01:44:31.639
the difference or the
dissimilarity between the sets.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20745-0
01:44:32.009 --> 01:44:36.100
So what is the best way to
compute the dissimilarity

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20745-1
01:44:36.100 --> 01:44:39.959
between the sets so the
similarity we can express

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20745-2
01:44:39.959 --> 01:44:44.744
between the two sets at the C1
intersection C 2 / C One union

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20745-3
01:44:44.744 --> 01:44:45.439
C2 right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20788-0
01:44:46.239 --> 01:44:51.018
So similarly, similarly, the
dissimilarity is 1 -, C, One

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20788-1
01:44:51.018 --> 01:44:55.879
Intersection, C2 by C1 Union C
So you can see that Jaccard

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20788-2
01:44:55.879 --> 01:45:01.152
similarity and Jaccard distance,
which is essentially these are

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20788-3
01:45:01.152 --> 01:45:05.272
representing the asymmetric
binary similarity and

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20788-4
01:45:05.272 --> 01:45:07.249
dissimilarity functions.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20853-0
01:45:10.429 --> 01:45:13.907
And we can take one more
example, which is that many

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20853-1
01:45:13.907 --> 01:45:17.648
times when there are medical
tests done, the doctors are

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20853-2
01:45:17.648 --> 01:45:21.651
hardly interested when the test
is negative because they are

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20835-0
01:45:20.579 --> 01:45:22.199
Can you go back to this example?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20853-3
01:45:21.651 --> 01:45:25.719
interested in the people who
have got a disease, because that

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20853-4
01:45:25.719 --> 01:45:28.869
is what is going to they need to
pay attention.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20869-0
01:45:29.609 --> 01:45:34.399
So when there are both 2-3
people got many medical tests

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20869-1
01:45:34.399 --> 01:45:34.819
done.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20882-0
01:45:35.229 --> 01:45:39.239
So now we want to compare the
the 2-3 people.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20891-0
01:45:39.349 --> 01:45:41.409
So what we do is that we divide.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20900-0
01:45:41.419 --> 01:45:42.999
This is the data set we got.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20908-0
01:45:43.289 --> 01:45:47.129
This is representing this is
representing symmetric binary.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20917-0
01:45:50.289 --> 01:45:52.919
And this is representing
asymmetric binary.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20942-0
01:45:56.629 --> 01:46:01.009
So for symmetric binary we will
use a different method, yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20935-0
01:45:57.849 --> 01:45:58.479
Houser.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20973-0
01:46:02.269 --> 01:46:05.440
I wanted to know like how can we
what was it tool to understand

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20954-0
01:46:02.629 --> 01:46:02.989
Somebody.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20973-1
01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:07.719
what is symmetric and what is
not asymmetric.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20974-0
01:46:08.229 --> 01:46:09.169
Then see.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/20986-0
01:46:09.179 --> 01:46:11.409
You need to understand the data,
then only you will do that.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21022-0
01:46:11.569 --> 01:46:14.967
So what we are saying is that
the medical symptoms are

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21022-1
01:46:14.967 --> 01:46:18.550
asymmetric because when 100
tests are done so the doctors

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21022-2
01:46:18.550 --> 01:46:20.959
expect all of them to come
manage one.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21030-0
01:46:21.029 --> 01:46:22.619
Now all of them to come as
negative.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21067-0
01:46:22.629 --> 01:46:25.568
That is 0 because there is
because the dog talk is

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21067-1
01:46:25.568 --> 01:46:29.256
considered when the symptom is
present, then they're concerned,

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21067-2
01:46:29.256 --> 01:46:32.829
but most of the people should
get 0 for most of the symptoms.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21075-0
01:46:32.839 --> 01:46:33.729
Miss Shamshad, are you with me?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21077-0
01:46:34.719 --> 01:46:35.409
Yes, Sir.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21087-0
01:46:35.449 --> 01:46:36.039
What order?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21089-0
01:46:35.719 --> 01:46:36.109
So.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21099-0
01:46:36.049 --> 01:46:36.919
What symmetric server?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21094-0
01:46:36.119 --> 01:46:37.529
So when no, no. Just listen.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21097-0
01:46:37.539 --> 01:46:38.109
Listen, listen.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21102-0
01:46:38.159 --> 01:46:38.489
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21143-0
01:46:38.579 --> 01:46:42.359
So you you understand that when
the doctor considers the when

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21143-1
01:46:42.359 --> 01:46:46.139
they order 200 tests because
there is a test package, so they

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21143-2
01:46:46.139 --> 01:46:49.859
are only interested in file
situations where the patient has

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21143-3
01:46:49.859 --> 01:46:51.139
got abnormal ratings.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21166-0
01:46:51.149 --> 01:46:55.037
So which they consider as one or
a significant attribute other

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21166-1
01:46:55.037 --> 01:46:56.889
195 they ignore Miss Shamshad.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21174-0
01:46:57.019 --> 01:46:57.559
Are you with me?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21210-0
01:46:58.539 --> 01:47:01.944
I mean, if if the reports are
normal, it will be 0 if it is

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21210-1
01:47:01.944 --> 01:47:03.419
not normal it will be run.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21191-0
01:47:02.419 --> 01:47:02.799
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21207-0
01:47:02.809 --> 01:47:05.129
And you know, and and then
they're not concerned.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21240-0
01:47:05.139 --> 01:47:09.149
So they are only concerned about
when there is a symptom, then

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21240-1
01:47:09.149 --> 01:47:13.222
they start comparing 2 patients
based on some symptoms that are

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21240-2
01:47:13.222 --> 01:47:14.749
present in both of them.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21243-0
01:47:15.099 --> 01:47:17.569
Because normalcy is expected.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21273-0
01:47:17.579 --> 01:47:21.414
Because because 200 tests maybe
there in your test package but

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21273-1
01:47:21.414 --> 01:47:25.309
actual number of medical tests
that can be done will be 10,000.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21289-0
01:47:25.719 --> 01:47:28.621
So they're not even doing the
10,000 tests because they don't

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21289-1
01:47:28.621 --> 01:47:28.949
matter.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21305-0
01:47:29.079 --> 01:47:31.729
They know for sure they don't
matter, but 200 tests they

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21305-1
01:47:31.729 --> 01:47:32.659
thought they matter.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21317-0
01:47:32.669 --> 01:47:33.709
They had done and out of them.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21331-0
01:47:33.719 --> 01:47:37.369
195 came as negative, so they
don't care about those 195.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21344-0
01:47:37.379 --> 01:47:40.186
They're only considering the
five cases where there is a

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21344-1
01:47:40.186 --> 01:47:40.629
positive.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21347-0
01:47:40.679 --> 01:47:41.159
Is that clear?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21353-0
01:47:42.919 --> 01:47:43.479
Yes, Sir.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21351-0
01:47:44.239 --> 01:47:44.769
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21354-0
01:47:44.779 --> 01:47:45.159
Thank you.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21373-0
01:47:47.509 --> 01:47:48.989
But what is symmetric over here?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21375-0
01:47:48.069 --> 01:47:50.989
So now we think the asymmetric
bank just missed Hampshire.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21381-0
01:47:50.999 --> 01:47:51.919
Just give me one minute.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21392-0
01:47:51.969 --> 01:47:54.219
Let me show the asymmetric
binary variables.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21411-0
01:47:54.569 --> 01:47:58.323
So with asymmetric binary
variables, we create a similar

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21411-1
01:47:58.323 --> 01:48:02.209
cross tabulation and then we
start computing the distance.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21422-0
01:48:02.319 --> 01:48:05.449
OK, so other people are
observing a mishap.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21428-0
01:48:05.459 --> 01:48:06.739
You have one more question,
right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21461-0
01:48:08.449 --> 01:48:12.889
Yes, like what is the symmetric
part over here?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21443-0
01:48:09.819 --> 01:48:11.249
OK, go ahead with that question.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21458-0
01:48:11.259 --> 01:48:11.869
Go ahead with that.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21484-0
01:48:14.099 --> 01:48:16.539
This symmetric part we are
ignoring because symmetric is

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21482-0
01:48:14.369 --> 01:48:15.889
He was with the gentle will be
symmetric.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21484-1
01:48:16.539 --> 01:48:16.839
gender.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21504-0
01:48:16.849 --> 01:48:19.535
We are saying that male and
female, we cannot say that one

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21504-1
01:48:19.535 --> 01:48:22.129
is symmetric and one is
important, other is unimportant.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21533-0
01:48:22.339 --> 01:48:25.227
So we are calling that as a
symmetric binary, so there that

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21533-1
01:48:25.227 --> 01:48:27.922
is a distance, but that is
computed using the symmetric

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21533-2
01:48:27.922 --> 01:48:28.259
method.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21545-0
01:48:29.439 --> 01:48:31.989
So we are not even considering
that for these cross tabulation.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21556-0
01:48:34.659 --> 01:48:36.469
But how about fever, Sir?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21566-0
01:48:36.479 --> 01:48:41.859
Like fever can also be if it is
there then probably umm.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21594-0
01:48:43.589 --> 01:48:46.869
Umm, you mean if there is a
presence of fever, that means?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21581-0
01:48:45.839 --> 01:48:46.209
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21583-0
01:48:46.259 --> 01:48:46.669
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21585-0
01:48:46.739 --> 01:48:47.129
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21603-0
01:48:47.139 --> 01:48:50.329
OK, let us not go too much into
the actual symptoms.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21621-0
01:48:50.639 --> 01:48:55.509
But Mr Anirudh, you agree that
in I150 crore people are there.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21638-0
01:48:55.799 --> 01:48:59.549
Fever is there for less than 1%
or .1%, is it not?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21659-0
01:48:59.559 --> 01:49:01.959
If it is 1%, is there, the news
will have nothing else.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21664-0
01:49:02.929 --> 01:49:03.309
Yes, Sir.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21711-0
01:49:03.459 --> 01:49:07.635
Mr Mr Anirudh, that you agree
with me, so treat that as don't,

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21681-0
01:49:05.419 --> 01:49:06.019
Yes and yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21711-1
01:49:07.635 --> 01:49:11.081
don't go into medical
discussions now, but we agree

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21711-2
01:49:11.081 --> 01:49:15.256
that when the negative when the
positive result is there for a

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21711-3
01:49:15.256 --> 01:49:18.769
symptom, the hospital or a
doctor should be worried.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21723-0
01:49:18.779 --> 01:49:19.819
Patient should also be worry.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21736-0
01:49:20.939 --> 01:49:25.128
So ignore remaining 20,000 or
100,000 diagnostic tests

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21728-0
01:49:21.959 --> 01:49:22.319
Yes, Sir.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21736-1
01:49:25.128 --> 01:49:25.889
available.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21765-0
01:49:25.899 --> 01:49:29.258
Forget about them because they
don't apply to and even if they,

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21765-1
01:49:29.258 --> 01:49:32.617
even if they do the test, it is
going to be you're going to get

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21765-2
01:49:32.617 --> 01:49:33.089
negative.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21786-0
01:49:36.039 --> 01:49:36.899
So uh.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21773-0
01:49:36.279 --> 01:49:36.589
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21785-0
01:49:36.279 --> 01:49:36.639
Yes, Sir.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21780-0
01:49:36.599 --> 01:49:37.369
Are we In Sync?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21814-0
01:49:37.439 --> 01:49:41.888
So so we can use that to compute
the distance the distance, which

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21814-1
01:49:41.888 --> 01:49:46.269
is essentially what we are doing
is we are computing for example

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21814-2
01:49:46.269 --> 01:49:48.089
Jack and Jim, Jack and Jim.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21839-0
01:49:48.099 --> 01:49:51.498
We see that there are three
cases where both of them are in,

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21839-1
01:49:51.498 --> 01:49:53.949
but they are not coming in the
denominator.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21869-0
01:49:54.299 --> 01:49:59.184
But we are considering only QRS
and then the distance is coming

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21869-1
01:49:59.184 --> 01:50:04.069
to be 2 by three and similarly
we are computing for the others.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21881-0
01:50:07.049 --> 01:50:10.339
So just a follow up question on
Shamshad's query.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21929-0
01:50:10.509 --> 01:50:13.254
So the the attributes which do
not matter to us a while

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21929-1
01:50:13.254 --> 01:50:16.392
creating this distance matrix,
they will be called as symmetric

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21929-2
01:50:16.392 --> 01:50:18.549
and those attributes which
actually matter.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21916-0
01:50:18.009 --> 01:50:18.459
No, no, no.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21931-0
01:50:18.469 --> 01:50:20.499
No, no, no, no, no, no, Mr
Charan, don't do that.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21935-0
01:50:20.549 --> 01:50:21.309
Don't do that.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21954-0
01:50:21.449 --> 01:50:24.767
The attributes which do not the
asymmetric attributes which do

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21954-1
01:50:24.767 --> 01:50:26.979
not make a difference to our
computation.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21960-0
01:50:26.989 --> 01:50:27.759
They are called.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21965-0
01:50:28.349 --> 01:50:29.239
They are ignored.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21995-0
01:50:29.549 --> 01:50:33.398
Symmetric are always considered
symmetric, but then we do not

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21995-1
01:50:33.398 --> 01:50:37.061
combine the symmetric and
asymmetric to get a formula that

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21994-0
01:50:36.709 --> 01:50:37.469
OK, OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/21995-2
01:50:37.061 --> 01:50:38.799
we that we'll combine later.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22005-0
01:50:38.809 --> 01:50:40.549
But till now we are treating
them separately.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22006-0
01:50:41.359 --> 01:50:42.499
OK, understand.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22018-0
01:50:46.889 --> 01:50:47.289
All right.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22022-0
01:50:46.949 --> 01:50:50.159
So the concept of symmetric
cancer is still confusing.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22045-0
01:50:50.169 --> 01:50:52.249
So you can use other example of
what.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22029-0
01:50:50.869 --> 01:50:51.119
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22047-0
01:50:51.129 --> 01:50:53.519
Yeah, no problem, because that
is a domain specific thing.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22078-0
01:50:53.579 --> 01:50:58.629
So domain specific thing, so, so
you you need to take it, hmm.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22099-0
01:50:55.599 --> 01:51:00.218
Even the even I even I'm not
able to understand the, you

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22099-1
01:51:00.218 --> 01:51:04.269
know, definition of symmetric
and asymmetric and.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22088-0
01:51:04.019 --> 01:51:04.569
Yes, yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22097-0
01:51:04.579 --> 01:51:04.929
No, no.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22101-0
01:51:04.939 --> 01:51:06.229
They're symmetric and
asymmetric.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22108-0
01:51:06.239 --> 01:51:07.269
Don't go by English.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22119-0
01:51:07.539 --> 01:51:10.909
So what you say is that absence
does not matter.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22144-0
01:51:11.319 --> 01:51:14.974
Is the symmetric symmetric is
where both absent and presence

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22144-1
01:51:14.974 --> 01:51:18.809
both are equally important, so
don't go by the word asymmetric.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22157-0
01:51:18.819 --> 01:51:21.751
Saying that asymmetry means that
the left should be longer than

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22157-1
01:51:21.751 --> 01:51:22.209
the right.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22161-0
01:51:22.519 --> 01:51:23.179
Don't go with that.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22195-0
01:51:27.189 --> 01:51:31.451
OK, so for example, in two art
documents, we said that both the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22172-0
01:51:27.649 --> 01:51:27.999
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22195-1
01:51:31.451 --> 01:51:35.246
documents miss million other
words we don't bother about

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22195-2
01:51:35.246 --> 01:51:35.579
them.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22202-0
01:51:35.829 --> 01:51:38.019
The document has only three
important words.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22207-0
01:51:38.029 --> 01:51:39.259
Document one and document two.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22241-0
01:51:39.269 --> 01:51:43.136
We compare based on only what is
present in both the documents,

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22241-1
01:51:43.136 --> 01:51:46.640
so rest of it is irrelevant
because the insignificant but

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22241-2
01:51:46.640 --> 01:51:49.359
then doesn't mean that they are
unimportant.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22248-0
01:51:49.369 --> 01:51:51.379
They may be important for some
another document.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22274-0
01:51:55.389 --> 01:51:59.346
You mean that cricket analogy
that you were taking the three

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22274-1
01:51:59.346 --> 01:52:00.059
attributes?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22267-0
01:51:59.569 --> 01:51:59.919
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22269-0
01:51:59.929 --> 01:52:00.459
Yeah, three.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22275-0
01:52:00.469 --> 01:52:01.499
Yeah, we I have.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22287-0
01:52:01.509 --> 01:52:04.199
I I think I don't know whether I
still have that.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22289-0
01:52:04.289 --> 01:52:04.509
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22292-0
01:52:04.519 --> 01:52:04.999
Yeah, right.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22295-0
01:52:05.049 --> 01:52:05.509
Right, right.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22304-0
01:52:05.549 --> 01:52:07.189
So this is this is what
document.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22308-0
01:52:07.199 --> 01:52:08.039
One document, yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22345-0
01:52:09.489 --> 01:52:14.322
So you mean these three words
here since they are making sense

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22345-1
01:52:14.322 --> 01:52:19.231
for our analysis, so they would
be becoming symmetric and other

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22345-2
01:52:19.231 --> 01:52:20.919
attributes in the doc.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22348-0
01:52:19.939 --> 01:52:21.269
No, no, no, no, no, no.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22358-0
01:52:21.279 --> 01:52:23.929
The both of them we are
considering this document.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22365-0
01:52:24.219 --> 01:52:26.409
Both the documents are only
asymmetric variables.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22379-0
01:52:27.869 --> 01:52:29.209
Who is talking? Mr Anirudh?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22382-0
01:52:29.219 --> 01:52:29.369
Right.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22375-0
01:52:29.689 --> 01:52:29.999
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22399-0
01:52:30.009 --> 01:52:31.599
Yeah, sorry, Sir, but I'm not
able to.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22393-0
01:52:30.639 --> 01:52:31.509
Yeah, both of them.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22397-0
01:52:31.519 --> 01:52:33.289
Both of them are asymmetric.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22405-0
01:52:33.379 --> 01:52:34.549
How many variables are there?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22413-0
01:52:34.559 --> 01:52:35.869
There are four variables here.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22445-0
01:52:36.479 --> 01:52:39.910
Mr Anirudh, can you see that you
compare combine both the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22423-0
01:52:37.829 --> 01:52:38.379
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22433-0
01:52:38.429 --> 01:52:38.829
Yes, Sir.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22445-1
01:52:39.910 --> 01:52:43.282
documents, you're getting 4
variables and use those four

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22445-2
01:52:43.282 --> 01:52:45.589
variables to compare the the
distance.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22460-0
01:52:48.249 --> 01:52:49.809
OK, what about?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22455-0
01:52:48.579 --> 01:52:49.769
And remaining variables.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22469-0
01:52:49.779 --> 01:52:52.431
For example, you can say
Australia, Australia does not

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22469-1
01:52:52.431 --> 01:52:53.009
matter here.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22480-0
01:52:53.089 --> 01:52:55.489
So when you comparing document
one and document.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22487-0
01:52:56.309 --> 01:52:58.559
So if you say Australia is
important, no.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22495-0
01:52:58.569 --> 01:53:00.379
But then for this purpose it is
ignored.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22510-0
01:53:02.549 --> 01:53:08.809
So it means that for asymmetric
we are absence is not.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22518-0
01:53:11.349 --> 01:53:12.299
Does not matter.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22521-0
01:53:12.309 --> 01:53:14.629
And for symmetric we are.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22527-0
01:53:14.959 --> 01:53:15.499
A.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22551-0
01:53:16.379 --> 01:53:20.259
Comparing all the both thing or
let him loose.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22547-0
01:53:18.239 --> 01:53:20.209
All attributes and all
attributes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22556-0
01:53:20.269 --> 01:53:22.699
Every possible value is equally
important. OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22557-0
01:53:22.179 --> 01:53:23.219
Yeah. OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22575-0
01:53:25.939 --> 01:53:28.759
So we don't be so now we
proceed.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22577-0
01:53:28.189 --> 01:53:30.939
So what is the QRS value?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22582-0
01:53:31.009 --> 01:53:31.769
How this computer?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22584-0
01:53:32.919 --> 01:53:33.769
Q artists.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22603-0
01:53:33.779 --> 01:53:36.929
Uh be have shown in the QRS not
so QRS.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22607-0
01:53:37.159 --> 01:53:38.159
This is the way we compute.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22616-0
01:53:43.799 --> 01:53:46.079
The Jack you got, the one
always.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22623-0
01:53:49.129 --> 01:53:49.409
Ohh.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22643-0
01:53:50.029 --> 01:53:52.828
You forgive and that I can
understand there is a formula,

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22643-1
01:53:52.828 --> 01:53:53.359
right? The.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22644-0
01:53:53.509 --> 01:53:54.989
You and audio see everything.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22671-0
01:53:54.999 --> 01:53:59.020
There is a formula just to the
formula is simply keep counting

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22671-1
01:53:59.020 --> 01:54:02.339
the keep counting how many times
one is the object.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22682-0
01:54:02.349 --> 01:54:05.049
I has got one and object J has
got zero and so on.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22693-0
01:54:05.749 --> 01:54:07.619
So it is simply a matter of
counting.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22702-0
01:54:07.669 --> 01:54:10.069
You get QRST all of them by
counting.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22707-0
01:54:14.319 --> 01:54:15.629
Said I'm VISHAL here.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22713-0
01:54:15.819 --> 01:54:17.139
So one small question.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22736-0
01:54:18.539 --> 01:54:23.906
Which scenario we will ignore PB
and which scenario we will

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22736-1
01:54:23.906 --> 01:54:26.769
consider P like in this current.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22739-0
01:54:24.879 --> 01:54:27.139
B is what? BRT?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22743-0
01:54:28.319 --> 01:54:29.919
Pee pee pee, part parrot? Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22764-0
01:54:31.289 --> 01:54:35.173
P for parrot, P is not ignored
in any situation, so I don't

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22764-1
01:54:35.173 --> 01:54:37.179
know where which is the P here.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22769-0
01:54:37.609 --> 01:54:38.049
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22774-0
01:54:37.709 --> 01:54:38.369
Where is the P.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22799-0
01:54:38.059 --> 01:54:42.362
What in here we are considering
in the in the in the denominator

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22799-1
01:54:42.362 --> 01:54:44.149
we are only taking the QRS.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22796-0
01:54:44.809 --> 01:54:45.079
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22801-0
01:54:45.089 --> 01:54:45.839
Yeah, that is right.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22812-0
01:54:45.849 --> 01:54:47.179
That is, that is the formula,
yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22829-0
01:54:47.329 --> 01:54:51.809
And previously we are taking a P
also be also.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22837-0
01:54:51.179 --> 01:54:54.181
No, no, P is P is actually
different thing, which is for

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22837-1
01:54:54.181 --> 01:54:55.129
nominal variables.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22844-0
01:54:55.299 --> 01:54:57.209
P never came into this.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22886-0
01:54:57.299 --> 01:55:00.923
So all I'm saying is that if you
take Q + r + + t, that becomes

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22864-0
01:54:58.229 --> 01:54:58.979
It was tea.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22886-1
01:55:00.923 --> 01:55:04.263
equal to P of the nominal
variables and the formula we can

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22884-0
01:55:03.639 --> 01:55:03.869
Umm.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22886-2
01:55:04.263 --> 01:55:05.509
look somewhat similar.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22896-0
01:55:05.519 --> 01:55:07.769
You can understand the formula
in a similar way, nothing more.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22901-0
01:55:08.219 --> 01:55:10.129
Don't don't confuse here.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22911-0
01:55:10.139 --> 01:55:12.379
Here we never use P in the
binary attributes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22933-0
01:55:14.929 --> 01:55:18.365
So that's what the confusion
coming said where we consider

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22933-1
01:55:18.365 --> 01:55:19.239
what and where.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22943-0
01:55:19.389 --> 01:55:21.129
It's very difficult to remember.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22956-0
01:55:21.909 --> 01:55:25.343
No, no, you don't need to
remember the formula are so

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22956-1
01:55:25.343 --> 01:55:26.679
simple straight away.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22964-0
01:55:26.689 --> 01:55:28.589
Count and do the apply the
formula.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22967-0
01:55:28.599 --> 01:55:29.059
That's it.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22988-0
01:55:29.449 --> 01:55:32.669
So for example, here we are just
counting the where they are

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/22988-1
01:55:32.669 --> 01:55:34.569
similar and then applying the
fund.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23009-0
01:55:38.879 --> 01:55:40.999
Yeah, but the YT is not
considered here.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23006-0
01:55:39.509 --> 01:55:41.219
No, no, I said Mr VISHAL.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23036-0
01:55:41.569 --> 01:55:45.699
Just at present, you may have
been confused because you're

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23036-1
01:55:45.699 --> 01:55:50.249
seeing it, but the concepts are
not difficult, so don't worry so

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23036-2
01:55:50.249 --> 01:55:50.459
so.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23043-0
01:55:50.459 --> 01:55:50.679
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23048-0
01:55:50.469 --> 01:55:53.059
But then, but then all of them
require time.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23121-0
01:55:53.139 --> 01:55:56.481
So the point is that you need to
give some attention to those

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23121-1
01:55:56.481 --> 01:55:59.877
formula and then use that, but
the concepts are simple when it

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23121-2
01:55:59.877 --> 01:56:03.219
is nominal, you're looking at
the parameters and matches when

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23121-3
01:56:03.219 --> 01:56:06.561
it is ordinal, you are also not
only looking at that, you are

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23121-4
01:56:06.561 --> 01:56:09.742
also looking at the ranking
within that, and then you have

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23121-5
01:56:09.742 --> 01:56:11.359
to combine various attributes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23124-0
01:56:11.739 --> 01:56:11.909
Uh.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23161-0
01:56:11.919 --> 01:56:15.202
Various parameters or various
attributes using some formula,

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23161-1
01:56:15.202 --> 01:56:18.593
it can be Euclidean or it can be
Manhattan or many, many other

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23161-2
01:56:18.593 --> 01:56:21.929
distance measures, and when it
is binary you are only looking

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23161-3
01:56:21.929 --> 01:56:22.629
at symmetric.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23171-0
01:56:22.639 --> 01:56:25.009
Binary is all of them have got
the same importance.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23219-0
01:56:25.019 --> 01:56:28.511
So you are computing based on
the matches and mismatches the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23219-1
01:56:28.511 --> 01:56:32.289
matches means 11 on both objects
and mismatches is one is object,

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23219-2
01:56:32.289 --> 01:56:35.895
is one, another object is, so
that is pretty much the concept,

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23219-3
01:56:35.895 --> 01:56:36.639
nothing more.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23234-0
01:56:37.539 --> 01:56:41.119
And then you are going to get
the same distance for me.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23278-0
01:56:42.859 --> 01:56:47.097
So can we do one on the next
slide where we have the table

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23278-1
01:56:47.097 --> 01:56:51.694
and count just for one any one
like either between Jack and Jim

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23257-0
01:56:47.709 --> 01:56:47.929
Hmm.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23270-0
01:56:50.759 --> 01:56:51.119
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23278-2
01:56:51.694 --> 01:56:52.699
and let's see?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23273-0
01:56:53.619 --> 01:56:53.989
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23275-0
01:56:53.999 --> 01:56:54.289
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23279-0
01:56:54.299 --> 01:56:54.989
OK, fine.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23287-0
01:56:54.999 --> 01:56:57.789
Fine, Mr Santosh, just stay.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23297-0
01:56:58.579 --> 01:57:01.069
So let us take Jack and Mary.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23320-0
01:57:01.339 --> 01:57:06.846
OK, Jack and Mary, because we
are getting a different types of

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23309-0
01:57:04.579 --> 01:57:04.759
Right.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23320-1
01:57:06.846 --> 01:57:08.769
numbers Jack and Mary.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23335-0
01:57:09.459 --> 01:57:15.229
So we are seeing that how many
times Jack is 1 and maybe 0.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23340-0
01:57:15.239 --> 01:57:16.569
So this is ignored, right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23349-0
01:57:16.619 --> 01:57:17.889
This is ignored that is
understood.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23361-0
01:57:18.709 --> 01:57:21.579
So Jack is 1 and Mary is 0.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23380-0
01:57:22.189 --> 01:57:25.742
So we are seeing that OK, Jack
is 1 and Mary's one let us look

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23380-1
01:57:25.742 --> 01:57:26.249
for that.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23393-0
01:57:26.609 --> 01:57:31.469
So fever, Jack and Mary are one
and test one.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23412-0
01:57:31.519 --> 01:57:35.455
Both of them are one, so there
are two times when both of them

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23412-1
01:57:35.455 --> 01:57:37.079
are one Q is equal to two.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23420-0
01:57:37.429 --> 01:57:38.479
Is that fine, Mr Santosh?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23430-0
01:57:39.189 --> 01:57:39.879
Right, yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23444-0
01:57:40.509 --> 01:57:41.829
So similarly you can move.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23442-0
01:57:40.779 --> 01:57:41.679
No, no, but but.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23450-0
01:57:41.639 --> 01:57:43.399
What once again, once again,
please Sir.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23453-0
01:57:41.759 --> 01:57:45.639
But Sir, as the three and test
four also same.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23462-0
01:57:45.649 --> 01:57:45.869
No Sir.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23464-0
01:57:46.509 --> 01:57:47.529
No, no, that's the three.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23473-0
01:57:47.539 --> 01:57:49.159
They are negative when they they
are negative.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23478-0
01:57:49.169 --> 01:57:50.529
We are saying that it is
unimportant.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23514-0
01:57:52.389 --> 01:57:56.128
So this is an asymmetric, so
when it is negative we have to

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23514-1
01:57:56.128 --> 01:57:59.741
ignore when both of them are
negative, we ignored when at

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23512-0
01:57:59.549 --> 01:57:59.909
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23514-2
01:57:59.741 --> 01:58:02.109
least one of them has to be
positive.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23520-0
01:58:03.809 --> 01:58:04.009
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23535-0
01:58:05.229 --> 01:58:07.929
For in case of cough it is both
are negative right so?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23538-0
01:58:08.969 --> 01:58:09.479
No, no.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23564-0
01:58:09.549 --> 01:58:12.784
For cough, both of them are
negative, so that is why they're

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23564-1
01:58:12.784 --> 01:58:16.179
coming as a part of the tea and
that is ignored in the formula.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23574-0
01:58:18.889 --> 01:58:20.679
So I never said, coffees
included.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23612-0
01:58:20.889 --> 01:58:26.375
So we included only fever and
test one for getting the queue

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23612-1
01:58:26.375 --> 01:58:31.411
and and then and then for
getting R where Jack is 1 and

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23612-2
01:58:31.411 --> 01:58:34.739
Mary J 0 so Jack is 1 and Mary
Zero.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23621-0
01:58:34.749 --> 01:58:36.319
There is nothing so R0.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23649-0
01:58:36.569 --> 01:58:42.500
So we where Mary is 1 and Jackie
Zero, each with respect to the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23655-0
01:58:41.179 --> 01:58:43.129
It's not following, so no, not.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23649-1
01:58:42.500 --> 01:58:43.149
No, no.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23660-0
01:58:43.159 --> 01:58:45.569
That is, with their test three
Test 3.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23676-0
01:58:45.619 --> 01:58:49.211
So we are getting S is equal to
1, remaining three we ignore and

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23676-1
01:58:49.211 --> 01:58:50.869
we draw the formula like this.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23691-0
01:58:53.719 --> 01:58:57.399
So are we considering only two
attributes fever and test 3?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23686-0
01:58:53.739 --> 01:58:54.169
Certain.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23713-0
01:58:59.439 --> 01:59:01.069
No, we were in this three.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23712-0
01:58:59.639 --> 01:58:59.829
It's.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23718-0
01:58:59.879 --> 01:59:00.849
Or that complete table.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23722-0
01:59:01.079 --> 01:59:02.609
We are also considering the Test
1.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23759-0
01:59:03.949 --> 01:59:07.886
But can we consider this is like
a PR gate alone like 1110 and 01

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23759-1
01:59:07.886 --> 01:59:10.869
are included and where 00 is not
included at all.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23775-0
01:59:12.089 --> 01:59:13.629
And what is P?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23767-0
01:59:12.379 --> 01:59:14.099
Yeah, you can imagine it in many
ways.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23771-0
01:59:14.109 --> 01:59:14.749
Yeah, why not?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23793-0
01:59:14.799 --> 01:59:17.732
Yeah, because we wanna say that
then other people will ask about

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23793-1
01:59:17.732 --> 01:59:18.499
our gates, right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23800-0
01:59:19.529 --> 01:59:19.809
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23802-0
01:59:20.189 --> 01:59:21.819
What is P value?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23805-0
01:59:21.829 --> 01:59:22.579
What is?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23817-0
01:59:22.889 --> 01:59:24.109
What does it mean by P?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23820-0
01:59:24.369 --> 01:59:26.209
P is positive, the test is
positive.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23828-0
01:59:25.259 --> 01:59:25.459
What?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23822-0
01:59:26.219 --> 01:59:26.329
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23827-0
01:59:27.299 --> 01:59:28.429
So the symptom is present.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23865-0
01:59:32.179 --> 01:59:36.664
So, so out of these all the how
do we create a metrics out of

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23865-1
01:59:36.664 --> 01:59:38.039
it, but what would?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23871-0
01:59:37.719 --> 01:59:41.009
Not once you get the distance,
so the matrix is same.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23895-0
01:59:41.019 --> 01:59:44.391
You know, metrics you are going
to say in this case you got Jack

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23895-1
01:59:44.391 --> 01:59:46.569
and Jim and metric Jack and Jim
and Mary.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23917-0
01:59:46.919 --> 01:59:49.441
So Jack and Jim and Mary and it
is a three by three matrix, you

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23917-1
01:59:49.441 --> 01:59:50.269
fill up the same way.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23932-0
01:59:52.379 --> 01:59:54.389
So will it be upper triangular,
lower triangular?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23948-0
01:59:54.399 --> 01:59:55.699
And how do we do?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23972-0
01:59:55.049 --> 01:59:57.277
No, it doesn't matter whether
upper triangular or lower

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23972-1
01:59:57.277 --> 01:59:59.822
triangular, but doesn't matter
when there are three people, you

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23959-0
01:59:57.839 --> 01:59:58.099
So.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23972-2
01:59:59.822 --> 02:00:02.209
can get only maximum three
distance elements, nothing more.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23980-0
02:00:02.919 --> 02:00:04.739
So how do we fill up these
values?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/23997-0
02:00:04.749 --> 02:00:06.459
Or can you try to write?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24001-0
02:00:05.809 --> 02:00:08.739
The three elements are metrics
will be looking like this.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24007-0
02:00:08.829 --> 02:00:11.809
So, so now let me say Jack.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24024-0
02:00:13.809 --> 02:00:18.679
Jim and made it so zero Jack to
Jackie 0.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24034-0
02:00:18.929 --> 02:00:21.089
Jack to Jim is .67.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24039-0
02:00:22.479 --> 02:00:25.319
Jack to Mary is .33.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24050-0
02:00:29.139 --> 02:00:30.969
You're able to read them right
.33.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24060-0
02:00:32.509 --> 02:00:33.129
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24054-0
02:00:33.769 --> 02:00:34.329
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24070-0
02:00:34.409 --> 02:00:39.009
And then Jim, to Jimmy 0, Jim to
Mary is .75.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24081-0
02:00:40.989 --> 02:00:43.559
And Mary to marry 0, right.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24083-0
02:00:43.569 --> 02:00:43.889
That's it.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24111-0
02:00:46.889 --> 02:00:49.758
So can you please explain that
Jack and Jim, the table, the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24099-0
02:00:47.589 --> 02:00:47.899
Said.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24111-1
02:00:49.758 --> 02:00:51.479
first table, how you will is
going?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24118-0
02:00:51.509 --> 02:00:53.249
Out well is one is 1.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24137-0
02:00:54.469 --> 02:00:57.975
No, that is no, I do not know
because we have just now done it

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24137-1
02:00:57.975 --> 02:00:59.199
for another two cases.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24142-0
02:00:59.259 --> 02:00:59.959
So how?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24147-0
02:01:00.029 --> 02:01:00.709
What is the?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24151-0
02:01:00.719 --> 02:01:01.549
What is the confusion?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24167-0
02:01:01.559 --> 02:01:04.721
Have you observed any any
specific thing which makes you

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24167-1
02:01:04.721 --> 02:01:05.719
ask this question?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24180-0
02:01:05.729 --> 02:01:07.249
So maybe who am I talking to?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24175-0
02:01:05.829 --> 02:01:06.419
Then the people.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24183-0
02:01:08.469 --> 02:01:09.609
Of the project concept.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24203-0
02:01:09.619 --> 02:01:10.259
So what is the?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24193-0
02:01:09.949 --> 02:01:10.199
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24198-0
02:01:10.209 --> 02:01:10.809
Mr vijaykanth.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24207-0
02:01:10.819 --> 02:01:12.459
Mr Vijaykanth, we we can do it
quickly.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24218-0
02:01:12.469 --> 02:01:13.839
Just same say yes or no.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24248-0
02:01:13.849 --> 02:01:17.333
Whether you are understanding so
you want to know why for Jack

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24248-1
02:01:17.333 --> 02:01:20.763
and Jim, right, Jack and Jim,
you want to know why Q is equal

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24242-0
02:01:17.979 --> 02:01:18.139
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24248-2
02:01:20.763 --> 02:01:21.039
to 1?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24262-0
02:01:21.319 --> 02:01:23.609
How many times both of them have
a value of 1?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24295-0
02:01:23.619 --> 02:01:26.725
Jack and Jim are first two
records, so you can see that for

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24290-0
02:01:25.659 --> 02:01:28.709
Yeah, 124.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24295-1
02:01:26.725 --> 02:01:27.709
only for the fever.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24312-0
02:01:27.719 --> 02:01:31.307
Both of them are one, but all
others neither of I mean either

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24312-1
02:01:31.307 --> 02:01:34.259
one of them are whatever both of
them are not one.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24328-0
02:01:35.119 --> 02:01:37.919
So for all others, so similarly,
we filled in the others.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24325-0
02:01:35.599 --> 02:01:35.799
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24359-0
02:01:38.729 --> 02:01:43.149
Said Ohh there is an end enemies
1 right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24338-0
02:01:40.089 --> 02:01:40.729
OK, OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24374-0
02:01:42.189 --> 02:01:46.882
Yenen needs to be are not yenen
is equal to T is equal to three

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24365-0
02:01:44.489 --> 02:01:45.169
And then zero.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24374-1
02:01:46.882 --> 02:01:49.229
so that that included all the N.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24377-0
02:01:49.979 --> 02:01:50.909
Sorry, sorry.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24391-0
02:01:50.959 --> 02:01:51.529
What you said?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24405-0
02:01:52.519 --> 02:01:54.089
And is negative and is new.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24419-0
02:01:52.569 --> 02:01:56.688
B is equal to 3T is equal to
three right T where did you get

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24419-1
02:01:56.688 --> 02:01:58.309
the T is equal to three.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24440-0
02:01:58.379 --> 02:02:01.693
The T is equal to three has come
because there are three tests

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24440-1
02:02:01.693 --> 02:02:03.639
for which both of them are
negative.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24449-0
02:02:07.349 --> 02:02:08.019
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24453-0
02:02:08.269 --> 02:02:09.449
OK, what?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24456-0
02:02:08.839 --> 02:02:11.779
Will talk them are negative.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24455-0
02:02:10.219 --> 02:02:10.369
And.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24471-0
02:02:14.249 --> 02:02:17.899
Just assume any zero and P is P
is one.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24475-0
02:02:18.019 --> 02:02:18.599
That's all.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24489-0
02:02:18.659 --> 02:02:19.969
Then we can set on.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24485-0
02:02:19.239 --> 02:02:20.149
Yeah, absolutely.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24487-0
02:02:20.159 --> 02:02:20.469
Right.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24492-0
02:02:20.519 --> 02:02:21.149
Absolutely, yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24504-0
02:02:22.899 --> 02:02:23.919
And no, then it will.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24532-0
02:02:22.899 --> 02:02:26.640
That one more question they
have, but after finding this

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24527-0
02:02:26.399 --> 02:02:27.219
Sorry, I interrupted.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24532-1
02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:29.199
numbers and the distance number
right.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24540-0
02:02:29.209 --> 02:02:32.049
So like the 06.7, all these
things.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24550-0
02:02:32.439 --> 02:02:34.919
So what what we're concluding
from that, Sir?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24565-0
02:02:34.999 --> 02:02:35.629
I'm not getting it.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24563-0
02:02:35.069 --> 02:02:37.059
No, no, don't go into that now.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24582-0
02:02:37.069 --> 02:02:40.199
Don't say that you want to do a
medical diagnostic.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24573-0
02:02:37.149 --> 02:02:37.389
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24588-0
02:02:40.209 --> 02:02:42.319
Just understand that we computed
the distance.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24597-0
02:02:42.789 --> 02:02:44.189
So what to do with the distance?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24607-0
02:02:44.199 --> 02:02:46.959
We will, as we see many problems
discriminating power.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24614-0
02:02:46.969 --> 02:02:47.659
Then we will talk about.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24615-0
02:02:49.209 --> 02:02:49.519
Yeah, sure.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24631-0
02:02:54.829 --> 02:02:54.989
I'm.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24632-0
02:02:56.649 --> 02:03:00.439
Alright, so so now this is the
summary of binary attributes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24641-0
02:03:00.449 --> 02:03:03.039
How to compute the distance and
similarity?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24656-0
02:03:03.389 --> 02:03:06.512
So now next one is numeric
attributes, so numeric

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24656-1
02:03:06.512 --> 02:03:07.199
attributes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24679-0
02:03:07.209 --> 02:03:11.316
What we what we need to consider
is that the biggest problem with

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24679-1
02:03:11.316 --> 02:03:13.619
the numeric attributes is the
range.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24704-0
02:03:13.629 --> 02:03:17.474
Right numeric attributes have a
wide ranges, so when we compute

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24704-1
02:03:17.474 --> 02:03:20.598
the distance, we need to have a
mechanism to do the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24704-2
02:03:20.598 --> 02:03:21.439
normalization.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24724-0
02:03:22.389 --> 02:03:26.089
So for distance we can have a
formula which is the Euclidean

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24724-1
02:03:26.089 --> 02:03:27.969
distance or Manhattan distance.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24733-0
02:03:28.509 --> 02:03:31.279
So Manhattan distance is called
a block distance.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24738-0
02:03:31.589 --> 02:03:33.629
So when you have a two objects.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24744-0
02:03:35.869 --> 02:03:36.819
X&amp;Y.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24751-0
02:03:36.889 --> 02:03:38.759
Suppose that this is the.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24758-0
02:03:38.829 --> 02:03:42.839
This is the grid so so I maybe.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24772-0
02:03:44.679 --> 02:03:48.069
I I think there are some Indian
cities very well planned.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24804-0
02:03:48.399 --> 02:03:52.800
So where all the streets are
parallel to each other, and that

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24804-1
02:03:52.800 --> 02:03:57.129
is the Manhattan is such place
that is part of the New York.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24812-0
02:03:57.629 --> 02:03:59.669
So we're all the streets are
parallel.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24820-0
02:03:59.919 --> 02:04:02.249
So they got the distance name
from there.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24863-0
02:04:02.419 --> 02:04:05.899
So what we are seeing is that
when you have to go from one

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24863-1
02:04:05.899 --> 02:04:09.557
point to another point, suppose
that you need to go from this

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24863-2
02:04:09.557 --> 02:04:13.214
point to this point, there are
generally many ways to go from

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24863-3
02:04:13.214 --> 02:04:13.509
here.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24867-0
02:04:13.559 --> 02:04:14.269
Go from there.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24901-0
02:04:14.399 --> 02:04:18.907
Let me use the blue color to
trick trust trace one part so

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24901-1
02:04:18.907 --> 02:04:23.643
you can go this way or you can
go this way or you can go this

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24901-2
02:04:23.643 --> 02:04:23.949
way.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24919-0
02:04:24.559 --> 02:04:28.227
All the paths are going to give
the same distance, which is the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24919-1
02:04:28.227 --> 02:04:30.749
horizontal distance plus
vertical distance.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24962-0
02:04:31.069 --> 02:04:34.695
So the Manhattan distance is
computed as some of the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24962-1
02:04:34.695 --> 02:04:38.321
distances along each of the
dimensions and Euclidean

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24962-2
02:04:38.321 --> 02:04:42.016
distance is based on the
shortest paths, which is the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24962-3
02:04:42.016 --> 02:04:45.779
which is coming from the right
angle triangle concept.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24971-0
02:04:47.219 --> 02:04:49.589
So this is called add crow
flies.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24999-0
02:04:49.659 --> 02:04:53.954
So I'm going to give you a give
you as a homework because I'm

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/24999-1
02:04:53.954 --> 02:04:57.349
going to put some of these
slides in the in the.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25034-0
02:04:57.829 --> 02:05:02.958
So please go through the example
of Manhattan distance, supremum

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25034-1
02:05:02.958 --> 02:05:08.086
distance and and then then these
distances and then we will talk

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25034-2
02:05:08.086 --> 02:05:11.479
about how to combine and how to
normalize.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25043-0
02:05:11.489 --> 02:05:13.559
There are two concepts that we
are still pending.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25053-0
02:05:13.939 --> 02:05:17.129
How do we normalize normalize
the numeric attributes?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25059-0
02:05:17.919 --> 02:05:19.489
What is the method to normalize?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25064-0
02:05:21.589 --> 02:05:22.749
And how to combine?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25070-0
02:05:26.009 --> 02:05:26.649
Distances.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25097-0
02:05:28.099 --> 02:05:31.209
So these are the two questions
that we are going to answer that

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25097-1
02:05:31.209 --> 02:05:34.028
combining is actually we are
already telling that we have

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25097-2
02:05:34.028 --> 02:05:35.389
multiple methods to combine.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25124-0
02:05:35.719 --> 02:05:39.929
So we are going to look at those
methods, how do we combine that

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25124-1
02:05:39.929 --> 02:05:44.009
and and then with the numeric
attributes, how do we normalize?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25166-0
02:05:44.299 --> 02:05:47.926
That is a question that we need
to address because we have been

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25166-1
02:05:47.926 --> 02:05:51.609
so far doing some normalization
for ordinal variables and so on,

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25166-2
02:05:51.609 --> 02:05:55.009
but for numeric attributes also
we need to find an alright.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25180-0
02:05:55.099 --> 02:05:59.069
Are there any questions that we
will do in the next class right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25197-0
02:05:59.319 --> 02:06:02.538
I think order or if there are
something that we can talk now,

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25197-1
02:06:02.538 --> 02:06:03.369
we can talk now.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25203-0
02:06:05.409 --> 02:06:06.779
So there's only one question.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25225-0
02:06:06.869 --> 02:06:10.911
So when we will know that the if
the question comes to find the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25225-1
02:06:10.911 --> 02:06:11.479
distance.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25238-0
02:06:12.289 --> 02:06:16.251
So when we will know that we
have to consider T and not

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25238-1
02:06:16.251 --> 02:06:17.029
consider T.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25244-0
02:06:19.039 --> 02:06:20.369
That is OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25252-0
02:06:20.379 --> 02:06:22.189
So now let me look at two
things.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25260-0
02:06:22.499 --> 02:06:24.719
So Mr this is Mr Yuvraj, right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25265-0
02:06:26.869 --> 02:06:27.539
Mr Yuvraj?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25270-0
02:06:27.109 --> 02:06:27.369
Right.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25271-0
02:06:27.549 --> 02:06:28.969
Right, Mr Yuvraj.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25285-0
02:06:29.009 --> 02:06:31.759
So there are two possible
situations when this can happen.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25295-0
02:06:31.769 --> 02:06:33.499
One, it can happen in your
business.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25319-0
02:06:33.599 --> 02:06:36.582
You got a data and you need to
decide whether to include or not

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25319-1
02:06:36.582 --> 02:06:38.959
to include, whether it is
symmetric or asymmetric.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25364-0
02:06:38.969 --> 02:06:43.203
Because if you are really doing,
if you're a data scientist at a

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25364-1
02:06:43.203 --> 02:06:46.981
medical laboratory or some
medical, because there are now

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25364-2
02:06:46.981 --> 02:06:51.020
huge hospital chains where they
do a lot of data analysis, so

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25364-3
02:06:51.020 --> 02:06:53.039
then that is a different thing.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25386-0
02:06:53.109 --> 02:06:56.702
So now if you are talking about
examination, what to do so are

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25386-1
02:06:56.702 --> 02:06:59.439
you really so much concerned
about examination?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25406-0
02:07:03.579 --> 02:07:04.349
Are you so much worried?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25402-0
02:07:04.159 --> 02:07:06.689
Yeah. No Sir.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25415-0
02:07:05.909 --> 02:07:07.099
You know, should we not?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25420-0
02:07:06.699 --> 02:07:08.169
Answer will be changed based on
the.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25418-0
02:07:07.649 --> 02:07:09.539
You're not worried, actually,
actually.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25487-0
02:07:09.549 --> 02:07:13.246
See see if in the examination it
is my responsibility to explain

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25487-1
02:07:13.246 --> 02:07:16.544
the question, so it is possible
that I may not be able to

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25487-2
02:07:16.544 --> 02:07:20.183
explain 100% or sometimes there
may be some assumption you need

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25487-3
02:07:20.183 --> 02:07:23.368
to make, but I will try to
explain it so so you will go

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25487-4
02:07:23.368 --> 02:07:26.439
with as per what is given right,
we say you're right.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25497-0
02:07:26.449 --> 02:07:27.919
So I don't know which is your
concern.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25522-0
02:07:28.799 --> 02:07:31.522
So are you concerned right away
that you may be losing one mark

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25522-1
02:07:31.522 --> 02:07:33.479
in the examination, but let us
wait for that.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25542-0
02:07:33.899 --> 02:07:37.585
So if it is your if it gives you
for your office data, you are

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25542-1
02:07:37.585 --> 02:07:38.229
the expert.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25545-0
02:07:38.239 --> 02:07:38.779
I'm not the one.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25549-0
02:07:42.289 --> 02:07:42.619
Yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25551-0
02:07:42.629 --> 02:07:43.309
Any other questions?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25578-0
02:07:48.679 --> 02:07:50.359
OK, so if there are no
questions.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25629-0
02:07:49.119 --> 02:07:53.724
So while creating the matrix D
like you write an A11A1A121 also

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25580-0
02:07:49.849 --> 02:07:50.729
Relate the.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25629-1
02:07:53.724 --> 02:07:57.897
how do we derive like I mean
again if you go back to that

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25629-2
02:07:57.897 --> 02:08:01.639
slicer please where where you
derive that Jack and.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25620-0
02:07:59.059 --> 02:08:00.059
Yeah, yeah, I have to.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25633-0
02:08:01.059 --> 02:08:03.959
Yeah, yeah, the you are talking
about this slide.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25642-0
02:08:07.079 --> 02:08:08.209
Are you talking about this
light?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25662-0
02:08:09.829 --> 02:08:13.379
Yes, yes, yes, yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25664-0
02:08:10.919 --> 02:08:14.799
Mr Remick, this is the slide
you're talking about, right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25667-0
02:08:14.809 --> 02:08:14.869
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25670-0
02:08:14.929 --> 02:08:15.199
Umm.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25673-0
02:08:15.879 --> 02:08:17.209
Yeah, it is simple.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25693-0
02:08:17.259 --> 02:08:21.392
Some convention saying that D is
representing distance and XXIJ

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25689-0
02:08:20.509 --> 02:08:20.759
Umm.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25693-1
02:08:21.392 --> 02:08:23.459
is representing some attributes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25712-0
02:08:23.469 --> 02:08:26.372
What we are saying is that that
is the JTH attribute of the ith

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25712-1
02:08:26.372 --> 02:08:26.689
record.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25719-0
02:08:26.699 --> 02:08:27.919
That is all we are saying,
nothing more.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25736-0
02:08:31.289 --> 02:08:32.029
So that is A.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25742-0
02:08:31.379 --> 02:08:34.079
OK, so we here we are only
concerned about that lower

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25742-1
02:08:34.079 --> 02:08:34.629
triangular.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25774-0
02:08:34.639 --> 02:08:37.699
But I mean, we are just skipping
the upper one like so just.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25753-0
02:08:35.559 --> 02:08:35.789
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25755-0
02:08:35.799 --> 02:08:36.139
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25763-0
02:08:37.069 --> 02:08:37.509
No, no.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25779-0
02:08:37.519 --> 02:08:40.109
But also we can do but then we
don't need the full matrix.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25798-0
02:08:40.119 --> 02:08:43.471
That is what we want to explain
so it can be upper half or lower

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25798-1
02:08:43.471 --> 02:08:43.729
half.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25803-0
02:08:43.739 --> 02:08:44.899
We don't need the full metrics.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25809-0
02:08:45.209 --> 02:08:45.529
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25858-0
02:08:47.319 --> 02:08:51.059
So you're comparing kind of
first in the first record first,

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25858-1
02:08:51.059 --> 02:08:54.921
I mean zero is coming because
you're comparing object one with

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25858-2
02:08:54.921 --> 02:08:58.783
object one, so it's zero, then
object two with object one, but

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25846-0
02:08:55.159 --> 02:08:56.229
Absolutely, absolutely.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25857-0
02:08:58.279 --> 02:08:58.459
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25858-3
02:08:58.783 --> 02:09:00.009
object one versus 2.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25882-0
02:09:00.019 --> 02:09:03.709
You're not concerned you either
get one value even, yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25896-0
02:09:01.949 --> 02:09:04.880
Because objectively, see, that
is what now we are saying the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25896-1
02:09:04.880 --> 02:09:07.859
distance between Hyderabad to
Delhi and Delhi to Hyderabad is

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25896-2
02:09:07.859 --> 02:09:08.099
same.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25929-0
02:09:08.409 --> 02:09:11.109
So we don't need to write it
twice distance from one to two

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25904-0
02:09:08.429 --> 02:09:08.829
Hmm.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25921-0
02:09:10.919 --> 02:09:11.529
Umm good.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25929-1
02:09:11.109 --> 02:09:12.999
is same as distance between 2:00
to 1:00.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25930-0
02:09:13.549 --> 02:09:14.619
OK, this is distance.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25937-0
02:09:14.629 --> 02:09:17.029
OK, good.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25935-0
02:09:15.509 --> 02:09:15.649
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25959-0
02:09:18.699 --> 02:09:23.706
All right, I think I think we
are doing fine and and and if

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25959-1
02:09:23.706 --> 02:09:26.209
there are questions I'll take.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25968-0
02:09:26.299 --> 02:09:28.199
Otherwise you can close the
session.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25971-0
02:09:29.309 --> 02:09:30.139
So one question.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25973-0
02:09:31.129 --> 02:09:31.309
Yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25977-0
02:09:32.689 --> 02:09:33.049
Umm.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25983-0
02:09:33.149 --> 02:09:34.189
So I'm gonna come.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25990-0
02:09:34.999 --> 02:09:36.039
That's like the.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/25998-0
02:09:36.089 --> 02:09:37.079
Exact score, right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26022-0
02:09:37.629 --> 02:09:39.169
Where did the ordinary troops?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26024-0
02:09:38.239 --> 02:09:41.139
Hi, Mr Pradesh, you need to come
closer to your mic and speak.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26036-0
02:09:41.209 --> 02:09:43.209
I'm not getting the clarity in
your voice.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26044-0
02:09:44.479 --> 02:09:45.439
So is it better for you?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26056-0
02:09:46.799 --> 02:09:49.049
A slightly better, but still it
is not so clear.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26064-0
02:09:50.899 --> 02:09:52.819
Which is the posted in the
discussion.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26073-0
02:09:52.829 --> 02:09:53.159
Thank you.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26084-0
02:09:53.499 --> 02:09:56.631
OK, you want to post it in the
chat or you can post it in

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26084-1
02:09:56.631 --> 02:09:57.009
canvas?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26090-0
02:09:57.019 --> 02:09:57.959
I'm I'm fine either way.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26095-0
02:09:57.969 --> 02:09:58.489
Yeah, yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26100-0
02:09:58.799 --> 02:09:59.759
Yes, thank you.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26105-0
02:10:00.479 --> 02:10:02.599
Are there any questions from
anyone else?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26133-0
02:10:04.859 --> 02:10:08.234
So all these concepts are
available in any book because

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26133-1
02:10:08.234 --> 02:10:09.319
there was no like.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26128-0
02:10:08.529 --> 02:10:09.619
Yes, yes, yes.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26140-0
02:10:09.629 --> 02:10:11.689
They are available in both T1
and T4.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26150-0
02:10:12.529 --> 02:10:14.659
Both both of them explain these
concepts.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26167-0
02:10:14.669 --> 02:10:18.019
I think they both of them have
not presently in latest edition.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26173-0
02:10:18.029 --> 02:10:19.199
Both of them are chapter 2.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26180-0
02:10:19.829 --> 02:10:21.679
Go in chapter two, they
explained.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26182-0
02:10:23.529 --> 02:10:23.749
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26209-0
02:10:25.559 --> 02:10:29.119
You planned and then look the
same, alright?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26211-0
02:10:27.259 --> 02:10:30.384
So these lectures will be
sufficient or we have to extend

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26211-1
02:10:30.384 --> 02:10:30.869
to books.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26225-0
02:10:30.879 --> 02:10:32.899
I mean, I'm just if we just.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26253-0
02:10:32.429 --> 02:10:35.979
No, no, no, no other our intent
is that in all these courses,

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26253-1
02:10:35.979 --> 02:10:39.129
when you attend the two hour
lecture, we expect you to

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26253-2
02:10:39.129 --> 02:10:41.419
explore at least for another six
hours.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26257-0
02:10:41.429 --> 02:10:42.419
That is the expectation.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26261-0
02:10:43.109 --> 02:10:43.839
So.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26281-0
02:10:43.909 --> 02:10:50.967
So the point is the they we do
expect and and then I hope we'll

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26281-1
02:10:50.967 --> 02:10:51.629
do it.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26292-0
02:10:51.639 --> 02:10:52.029
You'll do it.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26296-0
02:10:52.879 --> 02:10:54.299
That it is taking more than
that.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26297-0
02:10:55.619 --> 02:10:55.929
OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26304-0
02:10:55.939 --> 02:10:56.949
Then then fine.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26324-0
02:10:56.959 --> 02:11:00.504
If you're spending so much time
in exploring, then that is good

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26324-1
02:11:00.504 --> 02:11:02.609
and I hope I hope it helps all
of us.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26332-0
02:11:05.269 --> 02:11:06.399
Because he could be.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26355-0
02:11:06.409 --> 02:11:09.987
Please get some more clarity on
the questions of previous

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26355-1
02:11:09.987 --> 02:11:12.269
questions to get the insight on
how.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26361-0
02:11:12.639 --> 02:11:14.009
Ohh how.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26384-0
02:11:14.019 --> 02:11:16.978
What kind of questions we are
getting and how to prepare for

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26382-0
02:11:16.669 --> 02:11:18.619
Maybe I'm asking the same
question.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26384-1
02:11:16.978 --> 02:11:17.269
those?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26406-0
02:11:18.629 --> 02:11:20.825
Are you concerned that you will
not get good marks in the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26406-1
02:11:20.825 --> 02:11:21.279
examination?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26403-0
02:11:21.099 --> 02:11:22.329
Yeah. I'm sorry.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26424-0
02:11:22.619 --> 02:11:24.399
I will get good months, but
just.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26417-0
02:11:23.519 --> 02:11:24.329
No, but no.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26443-0
02:11:24.339 --> 02:11:27.180
But the question is that you or
you are learning so that you

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26443-1
02:11:27.180 --> 02:11:29.229
will apply it for your
organization, right?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26440-0
02:11:29.669 --> 02:11:29.939
Yeah.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26450-0
02:11:29.949 --> 02:11:30.689
Yes, of course.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26464-0
02:11:31.189 --> 02:11:33.459
So so now. Now, why?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26467-0
02:11:31.489 --> 02:11:32.999
So that's that.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26485-0
02:11:33.039 --> 02:11:35.479
Learning is good thing, but.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26475-0
02:11:33.469 --> 02:11:35.339
Why do you think they see now?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26478-0
02:11:35.349 --> 02:11:35.949
Just listen.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26490-0
02:11:35.959 --> 02:11:37.999
Listen, listen, I, I I tell you
something.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26505-0
02:11:38.429 --> 02:11:43.075
I'll tell you something because
we we teach at so many programs

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26505-1
02:11:43.075 --> 02:11:44.019
and all this.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26512-0
02:11:44.329 --> 02:11:47.829
So there were some students or
participants.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26521-0
02:11:47.839 --> 02:11:50.219
I won't even dare to call them
students.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26542-0
02:11:50.579 --> 02:11:56.429
So they have the ranks of CTO or
some people who are really into,

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26542-1
02:11:56.429 --> 02:11:58.379
but they are doing it.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26571-0
02:11:58.389 --> 02:12:02.343
They're still learning only out
of the enthusiasm because they

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26571-1
02:12:02.343 --> 02:12:06.109
hear so many things about new
technologies and new methods.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26597-0
02:12:06.119 --> 02:12:10.348
And then they they want to stay
there and seldom they get the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26597-1
02:12:10.348 --> 02:12:13.349
people who are very senior
people who join.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26628-0
02:12:13.999 --> 02:12:17.812
They do not get as good grades
as a very junior programmer in

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26628-1
02:12:17.812 --> 02:12:21.809
the same class, but then I they
never I I never saw any of them.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26633-0
02:12:21.819 --> 02:12:22.909
Anybody questioning that?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26646-0
02:12:22.919 --> 02:12:25.689
OK, give me one more mark or
anything like that.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26656-0
02:12:25.959 --> 02:12:27.469
So why are you so much
concerned?

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26703-0
02:12:27.479 --> 02:12:31.376
I mean, it's it really is a I
think the grades, yeah, that

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26703-1
02:12:31.376 --> 02:12:35.537
will anyway come but the but the
if I put the question papers,

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26703-2
02:12:35.537 --> 02:12:39.169
I'm more worried that you will
stop reading the books.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26712-0
02:12:39.179 --> 02:12:42.236
You will stop exploring what
people are doing, exploring the

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26712-1
02:12:42.236 --> 02:12:43.689
knowledge that you will stop.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26739-0
02:12:43.699 --> 02:12:46.937
You will only start exploring
the question papers and which

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26739-1
02:12:46.937 --> 02:12:50.338
how do I answer so that I'll get
full marks, but I don't think

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26739-2
02:12:50.338 --> 02:12:51.309
that is important.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26753-0
02:12:52.839 --> 02:12:55.329
Venkat Sir, I totally agree with
you.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26752-0
02:12:53.189 --> 02:12:53.829
They can drink.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26768-0
02:12:55.339 --> 02:12:59.529
But even the passing the exam is
also important.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26772-0
02:12:59.869 --> 02:13:00.879
No, that is fine now.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26840-0
02:13:00.059 --> 02:13:04.424
Obviously we all, yeah,
obviously we have joined to get

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26785-0
02:13:00.889 --> 02:13:02.289
So passing you know.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26840-1
02:13:04.424 --> 02:13:09.256
knowledge and to implement in
our our day to day task and how

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26840-2
02:13:09.256 --> 02:13:13.310
we can enhance a the
productivity by using whatever

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26840-3
02:13:13.310 --> 02:13:16.739
techniques we are learning, but
because OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26828-0
02:13:14.899 --> 02:13:16.209
Mr be just hold on.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26832-0
02:13:16.219 --> 02:13:16.809
Just hold on.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26851-0
02:13:16.819 --> 02:13:21.409
Hold on if you think that the
many things are important.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26855-0
02:13:21.419 --> 02:13:23.449
Exams are also important.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26860-0
02:13:23.499 --> 02:13:24.329
Don't worry, we will.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26881-0
02:13:24.339 --> 02:13:28.337
We will share something in
appropriate time and then we

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26881-1
02:13:28.337 --> 02:13:31.549
will also have some conversation
about that.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26890-0
02:13:31.639 --> 02:13:33.239
But then, don't worry about it
too much.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26893-0
02:13:35.329 --> 02:13:35.819
OK, Sir.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26906-0
02:13:35.989 --> 02:13:36.429
Thank you.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26902-0
02:13:36.139 --> 02:13:37.289
Focus on learning.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26916-0
02:13:36.979 --> 02:13:38.379
It's thank you so much.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26908-0
02:13:37.419 --> 02:13:37.909
Focus.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26918-0
02:13:37.919 --> 02:13:39.909
Just be clear whether you
learned or not.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26961-0
02:13:39.979 --> 02:13:43.110
So maybe if if you think that
there is some doubt, you go

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26961-1
02:13:43.110 --> 02:13:46.618
through these slide, go through
the video, go through some other

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26961-2
02:13:46.618 --> 02:13:49.803
either the textbooks or any
other source that you have for

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26961-3
02:13:49.803 --> 02:13:50.289
learning.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26964-0
02:13:50.689 --> 02:13:51.969
Just keep doing that.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26973-0
02:13:51.979 --> 02:13:54.739
Don't worry that the about the
other things.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26986-0
02:13:55.689 --> 02:13:58.945
So just be confident that you
can apply this in some

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/26986-1
02:13:58.945 --> 02:13:59.559
situation.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/27006-0
02:14:05.119 --> 02:14:09.265
Alright, so I think CTO's grades
are as good as the grades of

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/27006-1
02:14:09.265 --> 02:14:10.669
assistant programmer.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/27022-0
02:14:11.139 --> 02:14:14.113
So because there were same
class, I had both the same

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/27022-1
02:14:14.113 --> 02:14:14.829
organization.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/27042-0
02:14:14.839 --> 02:14:19.590
It was a collaborative program,
so both of them are there and

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/27042-1
02:14:19.590 --> 02:14:21.429
and so sure no problems.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/27063-0
02:14:21.479 --> 02:14:25.239
CTO grade are not bad, so there
are many, many such people who

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/27063-1
02:14:25.239 --> 02:14:27.149
come participate in our program.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/27069-0
02:14:27.159 --> 02:14:28.749
So very senior people.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/27075-0
02:14:28.759 --> 02:14:30.999
So don't worry about saying
that.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/27078-0
02:14:31.009 --> 02:14:31.739
Oh, OK.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/27080-0
02:14:31.749 --> 02:14:32.639
OK, great.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/27096-0
02:14:32.649 --> 02:14:34.443
So are the most important
things, so that may be

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/27096-1
02:14:34.443 --> 02:14:34.809
important.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/27100-0
02:14:34.819 --> 02:14:36.969
When you were in school.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/27108-0
02:14:40.189 --> 02:14:41.979
Alright, of course we we are.

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/27119-0
02:14:42.169 --> 02:14:43.659
We are hoping that you are going

632eb1bd-86e9-4515-8907-fa3f1242a697/27136-0
02:14:43.669 --> 02:14:46.769
You are taking interest in the
subject and I'm sure things will
