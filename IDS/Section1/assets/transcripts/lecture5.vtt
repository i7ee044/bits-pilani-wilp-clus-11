9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/48-0
00:00:10.578 --> 00:00:11.078
Good evening.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/76-0
00:00:13.458 --> 00:00:20.668
In the last session we looked at
how to compute or estimate the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/76-1
00:00:20.668 --> 00:00:24.948
dissimilarity between complex
object.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/102-0
00:00:26.088 --> 00:00:31.186
So we have, uh, when we look at
very simple objects in the sense

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/102-1
00:00:31.186 --> 00:00:34.088
that object with only one
attribute.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/116-0
00:00:35.348 --> 00:00:38.435
So in that case we are very
comfortable getting the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/116-1
00:00:38.435 --> 00:00:40.038
distances and similarities.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/128-0
00:00:41.788 --> 00:00:43.318
Particularly if it is numeric.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/173-0
00:00:43.368 --> 00:00:48.792
So for example, if you say that
there are three people and their

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/173-1
00:00:48.792 --> 00:00:54.049
ages are 2027 and 54, so you got
a picture of what is similar,

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/173-2
00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:58.138
what is dissimilar and how much
is the distance.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/203-0
00:00:58.188 --> 00:01:02.359
Everything you got in your mind,
but most of the time in data

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/203-1
00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.462
science when you deal with the
data objects, they don't come

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/203-2
00:01:06.462 --> 00:01:07.538
out that simple.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/219-0
00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:12.835
So they come with the 2000
attributes so many many

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/219-1
00:01:12.835 --> 00:01:13.798
attributes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/241-0
00:01:13.808 --> 00:01:17.576
It can be ten 2000 or it can be
much larger it depending on the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/241-1
00:01:17.576 --> 00:01:18.518
type of problem.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/253-0
00:01:18.528 --> 00:01:20.628
Scientific problem or whatever
that you are dealing with.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/300-0
00:01:22.028 --> 00:01:25.514
Uh, so in such cases it you
cannot think of similarity and

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/300-1
00:01:25.514 --> 00:01:29.236
dissimilarity like the way we
thought when the object had only

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/300-2
00:01:29.236 --> 00:01:32.662
one attribute, we thought we
know nothing about the three

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/300-3
00:01:32.662 --> 00:01:34.198
people other than the age.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/310-0
00:01:34.208 --> 00:01:35.958
And we want to use the age to
come back.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/323-0
00:01:36.468 --> 00:01:39.298
So it was much easier for easier
task for us.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/339-0
00:01:39.748 --> 00:01:43.457
So we have seen that the
attributes are divided into 3

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/339-1
00:01:43.457 --> 00:01:44.198
categories.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/384-0
00:01:45.228 --> 00:01:49.657
When we wanted to compute the
similarity or dissimilarity,

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/384-1
00:01:49.657 --> 00:01:54.236
first one was categorical and
one type of variant within the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/384-2
00:01:54.236 --> 00:01:58.064
categorical was ordinal and
another variant of the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/384-3
00:01:58.064 --> 00:02:02.643
categorical is the binary and
the binary can be symmetric or

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/384-4
00:02:02.643 --> 00:02:03.468
asymmetric.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/405-0
00:02:04.018 --> 00:02:08.069
So in all these three types of
attributes we have seen how to

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/405-1
00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.748
compute the dissimilarity or
similarity?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/415-0
00:02:13.148 --> 00:02:15.668
Someone said something or not
for me, OK?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/451-0
00:02:17.818 --> 00:02:21.903
Then we have seen that for
numeric it is, it is it showing

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/451-1
00:02:21.903 --> 00:02:25.918
that there is no scaling
required scaling we are going to

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/451-2
00:02:25.918 --> 00:02:27.718
talk about in a short way.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/474-0
00:02:28.328 --> 00:02:33.092
So we can simply compute the
difference or or the distance

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/474-1
00:02:33.092 --> 00:02:37.128
and similarity can be something
opposite of that.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/488-0
00:02:37.198 --> 00:02:40.638
So what is the which has got the
lesser distance?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/497-0
00:02:40.648 --> 00:02:41.728
That's what we may say.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/503-0
00:02:41.838 --> 00:02:42.678
It's more similar.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/562-0
00:02:43.818 --> 00:02:49.451
So, so now let's go into the
previous session where we looked

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/562-1
00:02:49.451 --> 00:02:54.994
at, we looked at the proximity
measures for the we have seen

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/562-2
00:02:54.994 --> 00:03:00.627
for the categorical attributes
then and ordinal attributes, a

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/562-3
00:03:00.627 --> 00:03:05.988
nominal attributes, ordinal
attributes, binary attributes,

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/562-4
00:03:05.988 --> 00:03:08.168
then numeric attributes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/601-0
00:03:09.078 --> 00:03:12.451
And finally, we said that when
we come to the complex

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/601-1
00:03:12.451 --> 00:03:16.385
attributes objects, we need to
find a way to combine all their

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/601-2
00:03:16.385 --> 00:03:19.633
effects because all the
attributes are contributing

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/601-3
00:03:19.633 --> 00:03:22.568
something to this similarity or
dissimilarity.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/609-0
00:03:22.898 --> 00:03:24.168
So we need to add them up.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/619-0
00:03:24.478 --> 00:03:26.048
So how do we add them up?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/631-0
00:03:26.508 --> 00:03:30.418
So adding up is actually very it
can be very simple.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/658-0
00:03:37.788 --> 00:03:42.279
And she let us assume that among
all the attributes we are

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/658-1
00:03:42.279 --> 00:03:46.008
getting the distance measured in
the same scale.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/680-0
00:03:46.888 --> 00:03:51.455
So in that case, what we can do
is that we can think in directly

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/680-1
00:03:51.455 --> 00:03:52.298
in terms of.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/686-0
00:03:52.588 --> 00:03:54.168
So we have many attributes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/694-0
00:03:55.358 --> 00:03:59.278
We have many attributes, each
one of them is contributing.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/700-0
00:04:01.138 --> 00:04:02.608
Let's generalize this.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/710-0
00:04:02.618 --> 00:04:03.888
OK, let's generalize this.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/719-0
00:04:03.968 --> 00:04:09.558
So A1 is contributing a distance
of D1.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/738-0
00:04:11.298 --> 00:04:15.584
OK, attribute A1 can be nominal
binary or anything is

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/738-1
00:04:15.584 --> 00:04:17.568
contributing distance B2.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/741-0
00:04:20.098 --> 00:04:20.668
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/761-0
00:04:21.598 --> 00:04:26.672
And between two objects this is
the distance we are computing

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/761-1
00:04:26.672 --> 00:04:29.208
and a three is contributing D3.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/771-0
00:04:29.678 --> 00:04:31.768
So how do I combine the
difference?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/807-0
00:04:32.058 --> 00:04:37.060
So what I will do is that W 1 *
D One indicating that for

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/807-1
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.458
attribute one I want to give a
weightage bless W2.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/823-0
00:04:41.508 --> 00:04:45.358
I want to give a different
weightage to attribute to bless.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/872-0
00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:51.091
Different weight is to attribute
3 and then I combine all of that

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/872-1
00:04:51.091 --> 00:04:55.947
and then I sum up W1 plus W2
plus W and of course it is

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/872-2
00:04:55.947 --> 00:04:59.588
possible that W1W 2W3 all are
equal to 1.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/880-0
00:04:59.838 --> 00:05:01.988
In that case, the problem is
much simpler.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/922-0
00:05:06.868 --> 00:05:11.266
So how did we compute we
computed using these measures,

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/922-1
00:05:11.266 --> 00:05:15.899
so let us look at a simple
example to see how are we going

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/922-2
00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:20.218
to combine the distance measure
among the data object.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/933-0
00:05:20.228 --> 00:05:22.378
So here we have four data
objects, right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/944-0
00:05:22.988 --> 00:05:27.908
We have four data objects and we
have 3 attributes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/969-0
00:05:27.918 --> 00:05:31.979
One is color, which is
categorical or nominal and

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/969-1
00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:37.095
quality, which is ordinal and
some quantity, and we don't know

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/969-2
00:05:37.095 --> 00:05:38.638
what the object is.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1003-0
00:05:38.648 --> 00:05:42.276
So let's take some quantity
number and what we will do is

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1003-1
00:05:42.276 --> 00:05:46.405
that we want to put the distance
of each one of them in the scale

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1003-2
00:05:46.405 --> 00:05:47.218
of zero to 1.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1017-0
00:05:50.138 --> 00:05:53.788
I'm I'm checking I'm seeing
someone is trying to speak.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1023-0
00:05:55.818 --> 00:05:57.318
Yeah, Sir.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1033-0
00:05:57.358 --> 00:06:00.288
Like I had to doubt for previous
class.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1069-0
00:06:00.418 --> 00:06:05.315
So for calculating the distance
whenever there is 2 attribute

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1047-0
00:06:03.728 --> 00:06:03.948
Hmm.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1069-1
00:06:05.315 --> 00:06:10.055
and when we go when we die
scalate the distance suppose for

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1069-2
00:06:10.055 --> 00:06:12.108
row two then row three no.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1071-0
00:06:11.658 --> 00:06:11.898
Hmm.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1082-0
00:06:12.368 --> 00:06:15.678
If you it's a row three, row two
and column three.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1120-0
00:06:15.848 --> 00:06:20.136
So for first call first column
we will only take the attribute

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1120-1
00:06:20.136 --> 00:06:24.151
of the first one and for the
second, second column we will

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1120-2
00:06:24.151 --> 00:06:27.758
take in consideration for both
the attributes right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1128-0
00:06:28.468 --> 00:06:30.978
No, no, no, no, no, no, not like
that, Mister.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1130-0
00:06:28.798 --> 00:06:29.358
Like a.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1149-0
00:06:30.988 --> 00:06:34.356
Amit, what we have done is that
in last class we have simplified

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1149-1
00:06:34.356 --> 00:06:34.978
the problem.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1157-0
00:06:35.188 --> 00:06:37.138
We looked at one attribute at a
time.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1162-0
00:06:36.668 --> 00:06:36.878
The.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1165-0
00:06:37.228 --> 00:06:39.458
We did not look at so.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1187-0
00:06:39.518 --> 00:06:43.201
So what we did is 1 attribute
and then we said all attributes

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1187-1
00:06:43.201 --> 00:06:44.448
are of the same type.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1196-0
00:06:44.268 --> 00:06:44.738
2nd.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1193-0
00:06:44.458 --> 00:06:45.458
Then how do we merge?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1208-0
00:06:45.888 --> 00:06:48.722
We never thought about when the
attributes are of different

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1208-1
00:06:48.722 --> 00:06:48.958
type.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1231-0
00:06:49.408 --> 00:06:52.408
So suppose binary attributes
are, they said we said 10 binary

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1231-1
00:06:52.408 --> 00:06:54.778
attributes are there out of them
two attributes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1253-0
00:06:54.788 --> 00:06:57.912
Both of them have same value and
in three attributes one is

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1253-1
00:06:57.912 --> 00:06:59.578
having one other is having zero.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1281-0
00:06:59.588 --> 00:07:03.504
So we thought about same
attribute types and for that we

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1281-1
00:07:03.504 --> 00:07:07.351
have tried to combine a Mr Amit
Army In Sync or Ms Sing

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1281-2
00:07:07.351 --> 00:07:08.038
something.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1284-0
00:07:09.458 --> 00:07:10.068
Yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1286-0
00:07:10.348 --> 00:07:10.768
Yes, Sir.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1290-0
00:07:12.648 --> 00:07:13.158
So.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1305-0
00:07:13.248 --> 00:07:18.688
So just let me let me go to 1
slide very quickly to explain.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1321-0
00:07:18.988 --> 00:07:23.278
So what we did was that for this
is a numeric attributes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1360-0
00:07:23.428 --> 00:07:26.964
So what we did is that this is
an asymmetric binary attributes,

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1360-1
00:07:26.964 --> 00:07:30.280
so we counted the attributes,
all the attributes other than

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1360-2
00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.158
the gender we said before
gender.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1378-0
00:07:32.168 --> 00:07:35.462
We will not consider because
that is symmetric, so only for

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1378-1
00:07:35.462 --> 00:07:37.878
asymmetric binary attributes
which are six.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1389-0
00:07:38.168 --> 00:07:41.458
So we consider the distance of
the rows.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1410-0
00:07:41.908 --> 00:07:46.350
We consider the entire row, but
job versus Jim, then Jim versus

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1410-1
00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:48.848
Mary A Mr Amit, are we In Sync
now?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1416-0
00:07:52.488 --> 00:07:52.868
Yes, Sir.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1417-0
00:07:53.918 --> 00:07:54.328
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1422-0
00:07:54.338 --> 00:07:55.288
OK, OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1425-0
00:07:55.358 --> 00:07:56.558
So can I proceed further?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1437-0
00:07:59.168 --> 00:07:59.548
Yes, Sir.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1430-0
00:08:00.278 --> 00:08:00.558
Yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1433-0
00:08:00.568 --> 00:08:00.708
Yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1443-0
00:08:00.718 --> 00:08:01.498
Let me proceed this.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1457-0
00:08:01.508 --> 00:08:05.311
So I hope things get clear as
you look at the example I I'm

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1457-1
00:08:05.311 --> 00:08:05.628
sure.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1459-0
00:08:05.698 --> 00:08:06.188
Yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1475-0
00:08:06.278 --> 00:08:12.568
OK, so now let us look at let us
look at the complex object.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1496-0
00:08:12.878 --> 00:08:15.917
So object one has got 3
attributes, but each attribute

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1496-1
00:08:15.917 --> 00:08:17.188
is of a different type.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1508-0
00:08:18.288 --> 00:08:21.458
Each attribute of a different
type, so we need to combine.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1517-0
00:08:21.648 --> 00:08:24.798
So for color, we have seen the
categorical attribute.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1533-0
00:08:24.808 --> 00:08:28.478
How to compute the distance and
the ordinal attribute we have?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1543-0
00:08:28.708 --> 00:08:30.308
We know how to compute the
distance.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1544-0
00:08:31.308 --> 00:08:31.808
Be in the.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1547-0
00:08:33.968 --> 00:08:34.428
Ohh.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1560-0
00:08:36.678 --> 00:08:37.168
Hello.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1565-0
00:08:38.128 --> 00:08:39.548
I'm hearing AC of myself.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1563-0
00:08:38.298 --> 00:08:39.228
What one of them?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1574-0
00:08:41.288 --> 00:08:42.768
Yeah, one but.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1597-0
00:08:43.948 --> 00:08:46.798
Yes, I'm gonna return unmute and
they are muted back.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1592-0
00:08:45.368 --> 00:08:46.338
Yeah, someone has.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1595-0
00:08:47.928 --> 00:08:48.298
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1624-0
00:08:48.308 --> 00:08:53.124
OK, then what I will do is I let
me mute everybody for a few

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1611-0
00:08:48.378 --> 00:08:48.898
You can go ahead.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1624-1
00:08:53.124 --> 00:08:55.018
minutes and then I will.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1637-0
00:08:55.108 --> 00:08:58.184
I will unmute you after some
time so that we can have a

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1637-1
00:08:58.184 --> 00:08:58.788
discussion.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1654-0
00:09:03.458 --> 00:09:07.048
So now let me I will unmute you
after I complete this example.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1674-0
00:09:07.098 --> 00:09:10.788
OK, So what we are saying is
that an object one has three

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1674-1
00:09:10.788 --> 00:09:11.488
attributes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1711-0
00:09:11.498 --> 00:09:14.037
All the objects have 3
attributes and we want to

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1711-1
00:09:14.037 --> 00:09:17.250
compute the distance, so the
distance with what we will do is

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1711-2
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:20.256
that what we know is how to
compute the distance for each

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1711-3
00:09:20.256 --> 00:09:21.188
type of attribute.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1724-0
00:09:21.578 --> 00:09:24.068
So for color, we know whether it
matches.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1727-0
00:09:24.138 --> 00:09:25.608
It is 00.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1748-0
00:09:25.618 --> 00:09:29.624
The distance is 0 when they
don't match, distance is 1, so

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1748-1
00:09:29.624 --> 00:09:32.408
you can see the distance matrix
4 color.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1753-0
00:09:35.398 --> 00:09:36.168
Only color.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1764-0
00:09:36.218 --> 00:09:38.608
OK, this is the distance metric.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1776-0
00:09:38.698 --> 00:09:42.128
Then for quality, we know that
this is an ordinal variable.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1783-0
00:09:42.138 --> 00:09:43.508
We need to compute a jet score.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1802-0
00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:47.676
Jet score is from the range of 0
to one, so there are three

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1802-1
00:09:47.676 --> 00:09:48.048
grids.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1808-0
00:09:48.058 --> 00:09:49.488
Fair, good and excellent.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1814-0
00:09:49.768 --> 00:09:50.968
So fair will be 0.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1817-0
00:09:50.978 --> 00:09:51.368
Excellent.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1832-0
00:09:51.378 --> 00:09:55.008
Will be one and good will be .5
and now we compute the distance.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1861-0
00:09:58.538 --> 00:10:01.560
Then for numeric what we do is
that the numeric is in a big

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1861-1
00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.028
scale, so again we want to bring
it to 0 to one.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1875-0
00:10:04.118 --> 00:10:06.918
So what we do is that we do a
min Max normalization.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1897-0
00:10:07.248 --> 00:10:10.239
So what we do is that anytime
there is a distance, we divide

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1897-1
00:10:10.239 --> 00:10:12.298
it by the distance of maximum to
minimum.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1909-0
00:10:12.648 --> 00:10:15.098
So in that case, what is going
to happen?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1921-0
00:10:15.328 --> 00:10:17.858
So we are going to see the min
Max normalization.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1959-0
00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:23.080
This will be the min Max
normalization when we see the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1959-1
00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:28.028
distance is 4/7 object one is
475 and object two is 0 object

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1959-2
00:10:28.028 --> 00:10:30.218
one is 475 object two is 0.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1969-0
00:10:30.228 --> 00:10:32.858
So and maximum is 100, minimum
is 10.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1986-0
00:10:33.588 --> 00:10:37.301
Sorry Maxim is 1000 and minimum
is 10, so we use this formula to

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1986-1
00:10:37.301 --> 00:10:37.758
compute.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/1992-0
00:10:38.668 --> 00:10:39.898
So did 21.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2019-0
00:10:39.908 --> 00:10:47.834
Is this similarly D31 is we
compute D3000 and D1 is 475, so

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2019-1
00:10:47.834 --> 00:10:48.758
1000 -.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2025-0
00:10:48.768 --> 00:10:50.818
475 / 1000 -.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2032-0
00:10:50.828 --> 00:10:52.298
10 so we get a value.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2047-0
00:10:52.668 --> 00:10:56.514
Similarly, we get all the
distance matrix entire distance

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2047-1
00:10:56.514 --> 00:10:56.978
matrix.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2076-0
00:10:56.988 --> 00:11:01.892
Now the job is to combine the
three, so we got the distance

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2076-1
00:11:01.892 --> 00:11:06.958
matrix for color distance matrix
for quality distance matrix.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2084-0
00:11:06.968 --> 00:11:10.778
For quantity, we combine all
this and get the distance.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2104-0
00:11:12.498 --> 00:11:16.428
And here we assume that the
weights for all the distances

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2104-1
00:11:16.428 --> 00:11:17.038
are seen.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2125-0
00:11:20.628 --> 00:11:24.355
OK, so if we want to use a
different weights, so we are

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2125-1
00:11:24.355 --> 00:11:26.418
going to get different answers.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2139-0
00:11:26.588 --> 00:11:30.858
So finally after completing all
the distances dissimilarities.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2151-0
00:11:31.168 --> 00:11:33.738
So this is what we are going to
get at.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2173-0
00:11:34.088 --> 00:11:38.136
So we can say that when we
combine the all the distances,

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2173-1
00:11:38.136 --> 00:11:40.858
what are the two most similar
objects?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2201-0
00:11:40.868 --> 00:11:44.553
So we have to say one and four
seem to be most similar because

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2201-1
00:11:44.553 --> 00:11:48.180
they have the minimum distance
and which are the objects with

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2201-2
00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:49.408
the maximum distance.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2249-0
00:11:49.418 --> 00:11:53.664
So it seems like two and three
have the maximum distance, so

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2249-1
00:11:53.664 --> 00:11:57.770
you can see point 88338.33 and
the other ones have one has

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2249-2
00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:01.528
eight point .8 through and other
one is .8 through 2.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2272-0
00:12:01.538 --> 00:12:05.498
Three, slightly smaller, but the
maximum is with two, three so so

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2272-1
00:12:05.498 --> 00:12:08.078
you can see whether you can make
that out.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2302-0
00:12:08.518 --> 00:12:13.078
Looking at the objects that 2-3
are having, the maximum distance

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2302-1
00:12:13.078 --> 00:12:17.428
and 1/4 are closest, so I hope
you are able to make that out.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2336-0
00:12:17.968 --> 00:12:21.309
Looking at the data and then all
our methods are giving a

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2336-1
00:12:21.309 --> 00:12:24.649
reasonable results because you
are finding this data, the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2336-2
00:12:24.649 --> 00:12:27.298
results are consistent with what
you observe.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2339-0
00:12:27.368 --> 00:12:28.178
I hope so.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2362-0
00:12:28.348 --> 00:12:32.652
So let me unmute you people and
for a couple of minutes because

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2362-1
00:12:32.652 --> 00:12:34.938
I'll after that we will
continue.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2369-0
00:12:35.288 --> 00:12:35.958
So.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2371-0
00:12:36.008 --> 00:12:38.928
So let me let me unmute people.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2382-0
00:12:42.348 --> 00:12:44.468
So I hope you are able to see
that.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2386-0
00:12:44.528 --> 00:12:45.078
Uh.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2399-0
00:12:45.388 --> 00:12:50.278
The one object one and object
four, which are looking similar.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2461-0
00:12:50.688 --> 00:12:54.495
They are also showing up in the
distance matrix with the minimum

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2461-1
00:12:54.495 --> 00:12:58.126
distance .0083 and object two
and object three are having the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2461-2
00:12:58.126 --> 00:13:01.522
maximum distance, though there
is no distinct winner here

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2461-3
00:13:01.522 --> 00:13:04.685
because there are three object,
one to two also has a

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2461-4
00:13:04.685 --> 00:13:08.491
significant distance and object
two to four also got significant

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2461-5
00:13:08.491 --> 00:13:09.018
distance.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2466-0
00:13:09.398 --> 00:13:10.808
But you can see that. Yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2488-0
00:13:12.288 --> 00:13:16.668
Are there two to three got me
maximum distance in this table.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2487-0
00:13:15.678 --> 00:13:16.258
Why would you?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2517-0
00:13:20.208 --> 00:13:24.478
OK, so so that is how we proceed
with the distance computation.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2500-0
00:13:21.258 --> 00:13:21.498
Yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2511-0
00:13:21.508 --> 00:13:22.408
Yes, Sir.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2530-0
00:13:23.748 --> 00:13:25.878
Right said I'm VISHAL here.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2534-0
00:13:24.728 --> 00:13:26.858
Let me show you how to compute
it.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2546-0
00:13:25.938 --> 00:13:28.008
UH-11 question.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2537-0
00:13:26.668 --> 00:13:26.918
Yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2539-0
00:13:28.078 --> 00:13:28.688
You OK?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2549-0
00:13:28.358 --> 00:13:28.898
Open quote.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2565-0
00:13:28.698 --> 00:13:31.508
You, you you have a question
alright? Yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2562-0
00:13:30.998 --> 00:13:32.018
I said just one thing.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2574-0
00:13:32.118 --> 00:13:33.358
So like.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2590-0
00:13:32.478 --> 00:13:36.737
Set the means there is a one and
four is more are more similar

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2590-1
00:13:36.737 --> 00:13:40.658
because they are matching color
and matching the quality.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2586-0
00:13:37.228 --> 00:13:37.488
Right.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2594-0
00:13:41.528 --> 00:13:42.168
Right, right.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2596-0
00:13:42.798 --> 00:13:43.998
Right, right.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2608-0
00:13:44.008 --> 00:13:45.418
That is what we are seeing,
right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2613-0
00:13:44.538 --> 00:13:45.118
Is that how?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2657-0
00:13:45.528 --> 00:13:48.950
Because, see, we are there is a
mathematical formula obviously

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2657-1
00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:52.534
with hundred dimensional data we
may not even be able to visually

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2657-2
00:13:52.534 --> 00:13:55.684
tell that, but we are all we are
saying is that we can be

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2657-3
00:13:55.684 --> 00:13:57.748
confident that our method is
working.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2680-0
00:13:58.758 --> 00:14:01.562
You look at the distance and we
have done it entirely

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2680-1
00:14:01.562 --> 00:14:04.728
mathematically and we got a
distance which seems reasonable.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2690-0
00:14:05.338 --> 00:14:06.448
Are you are we In Sync?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2691-0
00:14:05.728 --> 00:14:07.638
That that I.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2697-0
00:14:07.508 --> 00:14:07.758
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2718-0
00:14:08.598 --> 00:14:11.533
That after we calculated these
three types like how we are

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2708-0
00:14:08.918 --> 00:14:09.418
Yes, Sir.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2718-1
00:14:11.533 --> 00:14:12.428
merging all three.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2741-0
00:14:13.298 --> 00:14:16.671
Yes, we got the all the
distances in the scale of 0 to

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2741-1
00:14:16.671 --> 00:14:20.288
one and now what we do is that
we use this formula, right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2748-0
00:14:22.458 --> 00:14:23.718
We use this formula.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2776-0
00:14:23.978 --> 00:14:28.957
You can see so use the weighted
sum and the weightages we used

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2776-1
00:14:28.957 --> 00:14:31.248
is same for all the distance.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2795-0
00:14:31.258 --> 00:14:34.363
We use the same weightage and we
have computed look at the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2795-1
00:14:34.363 --> 00:14:35.678
computation in this case.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2801-0
00:14:40.108 --> 00:14:40.458
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2822-0
00:14:40.468 --> 00:14:42.588
So is there a case where like
where this will be different?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2817-0
00:14:43.518 --> 00:14:43.818
Yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2853-0
00:14:43.828 --> 00:14:46.687
See that depends on your domain
knowledge, because for example,

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2853-1
00:14:46.687 --> 00:14:49.502
if you are in a medical domain,
you think that one symptom has

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2853-2
00:14:49.502 --> 00:14:50.708
to be given more weight is.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2874-0
00:14:50.768 --> 00:14:55.111
So I mean, we obviously that is
that is for the domain expert to

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2874-1
00:14:55.111 --> 00:14:55.578
decide.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2881-0
00:14:56.378 --> 00:14:58.118
And we are dividing by the total
weight.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2899-0
00:14:58.798 --> 00:15:01.358
Yes, yes, total weight because
again, we want to normalize it

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2899-1
00:15:01.358 --> 00:15:02.638
and bring it to 0 to one scale.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2907-0
00:15:04.038 --> 00:15:04.358
Thank you.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2917-0
00:15:05.368 --> 00:15:07.188
So so the denominator.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2919-0
00:15:06.088 --> 00:15:09.158
Sir, how did we try this color
and quality metrics?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2935-0
00:15:10.938 --> 00:15:14.668
Uh, uh, OK, I I'm not getting
the question.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2957-0
00:15:14.678 --> 00:15:16.438
What is the question about the
color and?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2959-0
00:15:15.248 --> 00:15:18.158
The color and the quality
metrics is you drive right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2966-0
00:15:18.168 --> 00:15:19.308
So this one zero.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3004-0
00:15:20.308 --> 00:15:24.086
Yes, yes, that we derived it
earlier that that we have

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/2975-0
00:15:20.388 --> 00:15:21.068
Sorry 01.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3004-1
00:15:24.086 --> 00:15:28.139
derived using the same method
that we had used in the last

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3004-2
00:15:28.139 --> 00:15:30.818
class when it is a categorical
object.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3014-0
00:15:30.828 --> 00:15:33.498
If they are matching, we are
giving a distance of 0.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3027-0
00:15:33.508 --> 00:15:35.718
If they do not match, we are
giving a distance of 1.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3059-0
00:15:36.108 --> 00:15:38.777
If there are many categorical
attributes, so we are just

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3059-1
00:15:38.777 --> 00:15:41.633
simply taking how many of them
matching and how many of them

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3059-2
00:15:41.633 --> 00:15:44.208
are mismatching and accordingly
we are normalizing it.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3096-0
00:15:46.258 --> 00:15:49.213
And the quality and when it is
an ordinal variable, we are

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3076-0
00:15:46.408 --> 00:15:46.968
What is it?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3084-0
00:15:48.478 --> 00:15:48.618
Yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3096-1
00:15:49.213 --> 00:15:52.068
converting it into jet score and
computing the distance.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3105-0
00:15:53.018 --> 00:15:55.788
Then why are we keep that
quantity?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3107-0
00:15:55.838 --> 00:15:57.288
Like that quantity matrix?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3120-0
00:15:59.368 --> 00:16:01.218
Mr B, can you repeat the
question?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3123-0
00:16:01.908 --> 00:16:02.878
Quantity 1.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3135-0
00:16:03.088 --> 00:16:05.138
The quantity matrix, whatever we
derived.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3132-0
00:16:05.328 --> 00:16:05.988
Quantity.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3155-0
00:16:05.998 --> 00:16:09.537
The quantity is a numerical
thing, so for example it is a

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3155-1
00:16:09.537 --> 00:16:12.038
salary or weight or something
like that.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3166-0
00:16:12.828 --> 00:16:15.218
So there the range can be
significant.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3186-0
00:16:15.268 --> 00:16:18.419
So we are doing a min Max
normalization that puts the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3186-1
00:16:18.419 --> 00:16:20.578
distance into the range of 0 to
one.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3209-0
00:16:20.988 --> 00:16:24.960
So the min Max normalization
formula we have seen is that is

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3209-1
00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:26.718
that the question Missouri.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3228-0
00:16:28.398 --> 00:16:31.283
So this the question is about
the normalization that we are

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3224-0
00:16:28.938 --> 00:16:29.638
Yes, yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3228-1
00:16:31.283 --> 00:16:31.908
doing, right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3233-0
00:16:33.498 --> 00:16:33.718
So.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3246-0
00:16:35.068 --> 00:16:37.838
Mr Rubik, please speak is the is
your question?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3254-0
00:16:37.848 --> 00:16:38.958
I'm answering your question.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3252-0
00:16:38.018 --> 00:16:39.588
Yes, yes, yes, yes, Sir.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3258-0
00:16:39.598 --> 00:16:39.898
Yes, Sir.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3259-0
00:16:40.558 --> 00:16:41.508
OK, OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3277-0
00:16:41.618 --> 00:16:44.639
So you so you can see the
computation for the min, Max

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3277-1
00:16:44.639 --> 00:16:45.408
normalization.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3301-0
00:16:45.718 --> 00:16:49.060
So the distance we are computing
by taking the difference and

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3301-1
00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:52.295
dividing it by the distance of
the maximum value to minimum

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3301-2
00:16:52.295 --> 00:16:52.618
value.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3331-0
00:16:54.458 --> 00:16:57.958
So, Sir, in case if that is the
case, if we still have in

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3331-1
00:16:57.958 --> 00:17:01.458
quantity, we have like 4 set,
you know across 400 to 500.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3334-0
00:17:03.518 --> 00:17:04.028
Yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3339-0
00:17:04.418 --> 00:17:04.988
Yes, tell me.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3350-0
00:17:06.018 --> 00:17:08.738
Yeah, so now here it is like
10,000.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3383-0
00:17:08.808 --> 00:17:12.241
You know the variance is so
huge, but however, if it is in

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3383-1
00:17:12.241 --> 00:17:15.848
future, if it is like around 400
to 450 then how do we do it?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3399-0
00:17:16.118 --> 00:17:17.578
Even then we do normalization.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3391-0
00:17:16.458 --> 00:17:18.048
We can do this three.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3396-0
00:17:18.218 --> 00:17:18.658
No, no.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3403-0
00:17:18.668 --> 00:17:20.008
You can look at the formula.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3414-0
00:17:20.018 --> 00:17:23.248
This formula is never going to
fail because you are taking.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3456-0
00:17:23.478 --> 00:17:27.378
Suppose you got million records,
but even in the million records

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3456-1
00:17:27.378 --> 00:17:31.338
you are taking the maximum value
and minimum value and then every

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3456-2
00:17:31.338 --> 00:17:35.118
other distance your computing
using by scaling with the Max to

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3456-3
00:17:35.118 --> 00:17:36.138
me Max minus min.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3468-0
00:17:36.568 --> 00:17:38.238
So why will it change?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3479-0
00:17:38.248 --> 00:17:41.552
For example, India population,
let us say, the minimum age is

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3479-1
00:17:41.552 --> 00:17:41.658
0.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3499-0
00:17:41.868 --> 00:17:46.579
So newborn kit and the maximum
age in India is that let's say

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3499-1
00:17:46.579 --> 00:17:47.338
125 or so.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3535-0
00:17:47.428 --> 00:17:53.272
OK, so now anytime your age is
suppose 30 and my age is 40 so

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3535-1
00:17:53.272 --> 00:17:58.078
40 -, 30 is 10 but we are
dividing it by 125 -, 0.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3543-0
00:17:58.088 --> 00:17:59.768
So it will never be crossing
one.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3554-0
00:18:00.298 --> 00:18:03.028
So we are always normalizing it
by the maximum range.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3562-0
00:18:03.198 --> 00:18:05.128
Are we In Sync or are you
missing?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3567-0
00:18:05.178 --> 00:18:06.158
Are are we missing something?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3577-0
00:18:08.588 --> 00:18:10.118
No, Sir, I'm not too sure. So.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3611-0
00:18:10.168 --> 00:18:13.314
So let's say for example,
considering the example of

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3611-1
00:18:13.314 --> 00:18:16.579
collecting the documents per
individual employee in an

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3611-2
00:18:16.579 --> 00:18:20.318
organization, then if that is
the case, quantity will be like.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3609-0
00:18:16.628 --> 00:18:18.188
OK. Hmm.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3622-0
00:18:20.328 --> 00:18:22.138
Assume that there are hundred
documents.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3650-0
00:18:22.608 --> 00:18:27.009
The quantity can be same right
for all the employees then min,

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3628-0
00:18:22.738 --> 00:18:23.078
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3674-0
00:18:26.438 --> 00:18:29.686
No, in that case you don't call
it a numeric measure, so when

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3650-1
00:18:27.009 --> 00:18:27.288
Max.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3674-1
00:18:29.686 --> 00:18:32.724
all the employees you're
collecting 100 documents, why do

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3674-2
00:18:32.724 --> 00:18:35.604
you compute that as a major for
discriminating between

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3674-3
00:18:35.604 --> 00:18:36.128
employees?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3688-0
00:18:36.138 --> 00:18:38.524
Because here you are talking
about how to discriminate

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3688-1
00:18:38.524 --> 00:18:39.348
between two things.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3705-0
00:18:39.598 --> 00:18:42.775
For example, one customer is
having a different taste and

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3705-1
00:18:42.775 --> 00:18:44.308
other customer is different.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3733-0
00:18:44.498 --> 00:18:47.205
So you want to discriminate
saying that I will sell this

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3733-1
00:18:47.205 --> 00:18:50.148
product to that customer and
this customer will not like this

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3736-0
00:18:49.748 --> 00:18:50.188
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3733-2
00:18:50.148 --> 00:18:50.528
product.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3775-0
00:18:50.638 --> 00:18:53.545
Are you understanding this
because the idea of a distance

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3753-0
00:18:52.028 --> 00:18:53.078
Got it, got it. OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3775-1
00:18:53.545 --> 00:18:56.551
is that you want to discriminate
saying that this person is

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3775-2
00:18:56.551 --> 00:18:59.658
likely to catch a disease, but
this person will not catch the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3775-3
00:18:59.658 --> 00:18:59.858
all.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3811-0
00:19:00.138 --> 00:19:03.908
The idea is distinguished, but I
don't know in your example how

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3794-0
00:19:02.958 --> 00:19:03.588
Makes sense.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3797-0
00:19:03.598 --> 00:19:04.048
Makes sense.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3811-1
00:19:03.908 --> 00:19:04.968
does that work OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3807-0
00:19:04.498 --> 00:19:05.668
No, no, I I got it.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3812-0
00:19:05.838 --> 00:19:06.788
And and what is that?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3871-0
00:19:06.798 --> 00:19:11.361
What is that we have taken in
the denominator one into one,

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3871-1
00:19:11.361 --> 00:19:16.303
into one in the next slide, that
is that is that three next next

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3849-0
00:19:12.768 --> 00:19:13.648
Next slide.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3862-0
00:19:13.968 --> 00:19:16.148
This slide right is this the
slide.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3871-2
00:19:16.303 --> 00:19:17.748
one, Sir, next one.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3869-0
00:19:17.748 --> 00:19:18.378
Next slide.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3872-0
00:19:18.388 --> 00:19:18.948
This is the one.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3880-0
00:19:18.958 --> 00:19:20.888
Yeah, the weights are all equal.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3900-0
00:19:20.948 --> 00:19:24.488
We said weights are all equal 1
so, but the weight can be

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3891-0
00:19:21.978 --> 00:19:22.298
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3900-1
00:19:24.488 --> 00:19:25.098
different.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3905-0
00:19:24.728 --> 00:19:25.148
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3907-0
00:19:25.108 --> 00:19:27.078
If we think some attribute is
more import.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3910-0
00:19:28.878 --> 00:19:29.258
Got it.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3927-0
00:19:31.498 --> 00:19:35.582
Alright, so now we got the how
to compute the distance between

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3927-1
00:19:35.582 --> 00:19:36.878
the complex objects.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3943-0
00:19:37.088 --> 00:19:41.850
So now let us look at another
way to compute the the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3943-1
00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:42.838
similarity.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3954-0
00:19:43.228 --> 00:19:46.788
So this is when we have a high
dimensional data.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3963-0
00:19:50.118 --> 00:19:52.638
This is very helpful high
dimensional data.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3985-0
00:19:59.358 --> 00:20:04.205
And we are looking at, for
example, the data is such that

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3985-1
00:20:04.205 --> 00:20:08.048
it can be all the attributes,
all attributes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4003-0
00:20:08.108 --> 00:20:08.378
Thanks.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/3994-0
00:20:11.248 --> 00:20:11.958
Sorry Sir.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4005-0
00:20:11.968 --> 00:20:13.778
What do we mean by high
dimensional data?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4021-0
00:20:14.088 --> 00:20:15.508
We know two dimensional data.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4016-0
00:20:14.508 --> 00:20:16.518
Many attributes. Many
attributes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4034-0
00:20:16.528 --> 00:20:21.158
Suppose the object has got 100
dimensions or 100 attributes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4027-0
00:20:17.018 --> 00:20:17.878
OK, OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4041-0
00:20:21.368 --> 00:20:23.388
Each attribute is considered as
a dimension.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4042-0
00:20:23.968 --> 00:20:24.308
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4061-0
00:20:28.478 --> 00:20:34.848
All attributes are numeric, OK
and in that case in that case.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4073-0
00:20:34.958 --> 00:20:38.828
So a good approach is to go with
cosine similarity.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4089-0
00:20:39.058 --> 00:20:43.678
For this measures the similarity
so in two dimensional space I'll

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4089-1
00:20:43.678 --> 00:20:44.868
put it like this.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4100-0
00:20:45.158 --> 00:20:48.558
Suppose that there is a vector
E.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4107-0
00:20:49.708 --> 00:20:51.878
Then there is a vector B.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4130-0
00:20:53.408 --> 00:20:58.425
Then we have a vector C so we
can say that there is a greater

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4130-1
00:20:58.425 --> 00:21:02.308
similarity between A&amp;B
compared to A and C.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4151-0
00:21:03.868 --> 00:21:07.560
So that is the idea, because we
are seeing we are looking at the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4151-1
00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:08.298
cosine angle.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4163-0
00:21:08.508 --> 00:21:12.347
So when based on the cosine
computation, so we are seeing

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4163-1
00:21:12.347 --> 00:21:12.678
that.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4177-0
00:21:12.688 --> 00:21:15.138
So now let us look at how to how
do we compute.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4182-0
00:21:15.688 --> 00:21:17.578
Suppose that there is a.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4212-0
00:21:17.618 --> 00:21:21.660
There are some documents and
then we are we are we are

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4212-1
00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:26.436
representing the documents based
on the keywords important words

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4212-2
00:21:26.436 --> 00:21:27.538
that they have.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4227-0
00:21:27.848 --> 00:21:33.198
So now let us say our intention
is to look at the documents.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4268-0
00:21:33.208 --> 00:21:37.376
These are all sports documents
and we are we are looking at the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4268-1
00:21:37.376 --> 00:21:41.348
similarities of the document
because we think that these are

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4268-2
00:21:41.348 --> 00:21:45.060
the important discriminators
between the the presence or

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4268-3
00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:46.558
absence of these words.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4271-0
00:21:46.948 --> 00:21:48.678
We'll discriminate those
documents.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4299-0
00:21:49.008 --> 00:21:55.162
So in such case so we can we can
see that we can represent a

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4299-1
00:21:55.162 --> 00:21:59.298
document by a by the count of
the terms.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4307-0
00:21:59.658 --> 00:22:04.258
So we are representing document
by the term frequency.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4313-0
00:22:08.458 --> 00:22:09.568
Term frequency.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4326-0
00:22:09.718 --> 00:22:12.928
So we got 1234510 terms.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4343-0
00:22:13.158 --> 00:22:17.545
So for each of the terms, we are
looking at the frequency and

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4343-1
00:22:17.545 --> 00:22:18.748
then this vector.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4382-0
00:22:18.758 --> 00:22:22.662
What we are doing is we are
taking a cosine measure which is

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4382-1
00:22:22.662 --> 00:22:26.629
a dot product divided by the the
absolute value of the vector

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4382-2
00:22:26.629 --> 00:22:30.532
absolute value of the vector is
computed using the Euclidean

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4382-3
00:22:30.532 --> 00:22:31.108
approach.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4390-0
00:22:31.558 --> 00:22:34.828
So we take the square and take
the square root.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4408-0
00:22:36.408 --> 00:22:41.406
So now let us see how do we
compute the distance of 2/2

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4408-1
00:22:41.406 --> 00:22:42.298
documents?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4442-0
00:22:42.768 --> 00:22:54.066
D1 is this which is you can see
5030200200 and then D2 is 3020

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4442-1
00:22:54.066 --> 00:22:56.218
then 1101G1.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4493-0
00:22:56.848 --> 00:23:01.272
So how do we compute the
similarity so we take a dot

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4493-1
00:23:01.272 --> 00:23:06.531
product dot product is that you
you multiply the corresponding

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4493-2
00:23:06.531 --> 00:23:11.790
term frequency, so the term one
is term 1 is what team team is

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4493-3
00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:16.548
having five in presence in
document one and document 2-3

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4493-4
00:23:16.548 --> 00:23:16.798
so.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4503-0
00:23:16.858 --> 00:23:20.918
So you for that term we are
multiplying.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4513-0
00:23:20.928 --> 00:23:23.141
So essentially these are
representing the multiple

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4513-1
00:23:23.141 --> 00:23:23.618
attributes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4546-0
00:23:23.628 --> 00:23:27.612
So we are saying that it is each
document is represented by 10

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4546-1
00:23:27.612 --> 00:23:31.342
attributes and so attribute to
one has a value of five for

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4546-2
00:23:31.342 --> 00:23:33.618
document one and document two is
3.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4594-0
00:23:33.888 --> 00:23:38.731
So when you do a dot product
where you simply multiply all of

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4594-1
00:23:38.731 --> 00:23:43.653
them and add them up, then it
will be and then to get a cosine

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4594-2
00:23:43.653 --> 00:23:48.418
you have to divide with the the
documents vector site vector

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4594-3
00:23:48.418 --> 00:23:48.808
size.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4610-0
00:23:48.818 --> 00:23:53.990
How do you compute so you simply
compute using the using this

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4610-1
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:55.408
diagonal measure.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4638-0
00:23:55.798 --> 00:23:59.608
So what we are saying is that
along each dimension we take the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4638-1
00:23:59.608 --> 00:24:02.994
square and then for the
summation of the square we take

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4638-2
00:24:02.994 --> 00:24:03.538
the root.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4678-0
00:24:03.978 --> 00:24:07.680
So when we take combine the
square of five plus square of

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4678-1
00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:11.573
three plus square of two and
square of two that comes out to

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4678-2
00:24:11.573 --> 00:24:13.998
be 42, then we take the root of
that.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4685-0
00:24:14.008 --> 00:24:16.118
We are getting 6.481.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4707-0
00:24:16.548 --> 00:24:20.622
Similarly for D2, we maintain,
we compute the size of the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4707-1
00:24:20.622 --> 00:24:22.518
vector which comes to 4.12.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4722-0
00:24:22.988 --> 00:24:26.918
So cosine of B1 and B2 will come
out as this is.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4746-0
00:24:27.008 --> 00:24:36.548
This is actually 25 / 6.481 *
4.1, so this is what is the.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4754-0
00:24:45.238 --> 00:24:46.088
I hope this is clear.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4774-0
00:24:47.498 --> 00:24:51.933
Uh said how you get the cosine
means this formula means any

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4800-0
00:24:50.878 --> 00:24:58.351
I mean the formula is something
the cosine is see for two

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4774-1
00:24:51.933 --> 00:24:53.928
definition of this formula.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4795-0
00:24:56.328 --> 00:24:57.648
First line of the one and G2.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4800-1
00:24:58.351 --> 00:24:59.768
dimensions.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4837-0
00:24:59.778 --> 00:25:04.431
You can easily visualize it is
the angle between the vector you

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4837-1
00:25:04.431 --> 00:25:09.084
plot the two points and you plot
the vector from 00 OK and then

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4837-2
00:25:09.084 --> 00:25:10.828
the angle will come out.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4865-0
00:25:10.838 --> 00:25:14.311
So if it is A2 dimensional data,
it is easy to visualize, but it

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4865-1
00:25:14.311 --> 00:25:16.448
applies even for high
dimensional data.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4868-0
00:25:16.738 --> 00:25:17.388
Mr VISHAL.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4872-0
00:25:17.398 --> 00:25:18.078
Arvin. Sync.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4873-0
00:25:19.368 --> 00:25:19.698
Yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4878-0
00:25:19.708 --> 00:25:20.258
OK, OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4892-0
00:25:20.268 --> 00:25:22.692
That is, we are going to find
the angle between the two

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4892-1
00:25:22.692 --> 00:25:23.038
vectors.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4896-0
00:25:23.418 --> 00:25:24.388
Yes, yes, yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4906-0
00:25:24.518 --> 00:25:26.168
So so it is it is.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4927-0
00:25:26.178 --> 00:25:30.230
It comes from that dot product
divided by the the vectors

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4927-1
00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:30.998
magnitudes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4938-0
00:25:31.698 --> 00:25:36.088
Yeah, magnitudes of the both the
both 30 can say vectors.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4939-0
00:25:36.028 --> 00:25:36.288
Right.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/4953-0
00:25:39.088 --> 00:25:42.198
So basically we are considering
like a for this.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5009-0
00:25:42.208 --> 00:25:45.176
If I have to correlate it
mathematically, the inner

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5009-1
00:25:45.176 --> 00:25:48.715
product space we are considering
the DOT product as the inner

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5009-2
00:25:48.715 --> 00:25:52.140
product space and then we are
like doing the dot product of

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5009-3
00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:55.678
two vectors so that to find out
the angle between them right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5000-0
00:25:53.958 --> 00:25:54.118
Yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5007-0
00:25:56.258 --> 00:25:56.828
Yes, yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5042-0
00:25:56.838 --> 00:26:00.131
In fact, the DOT product and
before doing the dot product we

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5042-1
00:26:00.131 --> 00:26:03.585
are normalizing it by the vector
size so that the vector is not

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5035-0
00:26:01.808 --> 00:26:02.088
Sir.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5042-2
00:26:03.585 --> 00:26:04.988
going to arbitrary values.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5078-0
00:26:04.998 --> 00:26:08.281
But it is normalized to say all
the values come between zero and

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5078-1
00:26:08.281 --> 00:26:09.998
one, so that is how we are,
yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5083-0
00:26:08.578 --> 00:26:12.208
And the and this norm is
Nickelodeon norm, right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5089-0
00:26:13.608 --> 00:26:14.738
Yeah, you cloudian norm.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5094-0
00:26:14.748 --> 00:26:15.658
Yes, that is right.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5122-0
00:26:15.668 --> 00:26:18.960
So that is what we are dividing
it by the Euclidean norms so

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5106-0
00:26:16.068 --> 00:26:16.268
So.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5122-1
00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:21.118
that the vector gets normalized,
right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5120-0
00:26:21.438 --> 00:26:22.128
OK. OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5123-0
00:26:22.178 --> 00:26:22.538
Thank you.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5174-0
00:26:26.958 --> 00:26:31.199
It means it means the value if
it is closer to closer to one,

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5174-1
00:26:31.199 --> 00:26:34.618
it means more similarity, right
and 0 means less.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5162-0
00:26:33.158 --> 00:26:33.848
Yeah, absolutely.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5165-0
00:26:33.858 --> 00:26:34.508
That is correct.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5171-0
00:26:34.818 --> 00:26:35.588
That is correct.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5204-0
00:26:35.598 --> 00:26:39.511
When it is closer to 1 because
it is cosine is 0 degrees, is 1

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5196-0
00:26:36.108 --> 00:26:37.398
You know, means Lesson Realty.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5204-1
00:26:39.511 --> 00:26:41.498
and cosine 90 degrees is 0, yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5209-0
00:26:44.378 --> 00:26:45.068
OK, OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5237-0
00:26:46.738 --> 00:26:49.852
And then Theta is equal to Cos
inverse of that value then we

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5237-1
00:26:49.852 --> 00:26:50.668
get that degree.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5233-0
00:26:50.498 --> 00:26:50.888
No, no.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5250-0
00:26:50.898 --> 00:26:55.268
But we we don't generally go
into Theta compute the Theta.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5248-0
00:26:53.358 --> 00:26:54.008
OK, OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5270-0
00:26:55.558 --> 00:26:59.327
We are happy with the because
finally again our intention is

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5266-0
00:26:58.198 --> 00:26:58.758
OK, OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5270-1
00:26:59.327 --> 00:27:00.748
to do a discrimination.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5278-0
00:27:01.038 --> 00:27:02.908
So we are saying that what are
similar things?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5283-0
00:27:02.918 --> 00:27:04.048
What are dissimilar things?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5293-0
00:27:04.218 --> 00:27:06.608
Because that helps to solve our
data science problems.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5312-0
00:27:06.618 --> 00:27:09.380
So you, you we have already seen
examples of data science

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5312-1
00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:09.808
problems.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5355-0
00:27:10.198 --> 00:27:13.838
So our intention is more of for
example, I hope you remember the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5319-0
00:27:10.938 --> 00:27:11.218
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5355-1
00:27:13.838 --> 00:27:17.366
1st as we talked about who is
going to vote for the Republican

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5355-2
00:27:17.366 --> 00:27:20.838
Party and who is going to work
for vote for Democratic Party.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5407-0
00:27:21.288 --> 00:27:24.469
So now our intention is
discriminate the people if many

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5407-1
00:27:24.469 --> 00:27:27.991
attributes are corresponding to
the democratic principles and

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5407-2
00:27:27.991 --> 00:27:31.457
many attributes of the voter is
matching with the Republican

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5407-3
00:27:31.457 --> 00:27:35.206
expectations, then fine, we have
already discriminated and now we

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5407-4
00:27:35.206 --> 00:27:37.478
will put them into the correct
bracket.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5414-0
00:27:37.748 --> 00:27:38.978
And then we solved our problem.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5435-0
00:27:38.988 --> 00:27:41.971
Because our problem as a data
scientist is to tell what is the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5435-1
00:27:41.971 --> 00:27:44.338
likelihood percentage that these
people will get.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5440-0
00:27:49.208 --> 00:27:50.028
Makes sense of things.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5477-0
00:27:52.218 --> 00:27:55.697
OK, so now let us proceed with
the how do we handle the numeric

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5477-1
00:27:55.697 --> 00:27:59.120
data we have already seen one
way of handling the numeric data

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5477-2
00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:00.968
is to do a min Max
normalization.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5496-0
00:28:01.118 --> 00:28:05.028
So now let us see more generic
approach of what all things that

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5496-1
00:28:05.028 --> 00:28:06.188
we can possibly do.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5505-0
00:28:06.488 --> 00:28:09.318
So now let me let me go into.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5511-0
00:28:12.558 --> 00:28:13.908
Going to the new file.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5524-0
00:28:18.428 --> 00:28:19.388
Uh, said one.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5535-0
00:28:18.728 --> 00:28:21.208
So first thing is that we can
convert.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5528-0
00:28:21.268 --> 00:28:21.718
When?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5531-0
00:28:21.728 --> 00:28:22.058
When?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5538-0
00:28:22.068 --> 00:28:22.968
Just a small question.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5539-0
00:28:23.788 --> 00:28:23.968
Yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5548-0
00:28:26.148 --> 00:28:26.288
Yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5545-0
00:28:26.248 --> 00:28:26.638
Yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5601-0
00:28:26.688 --> 00:28:30.915
So I'm saying that like
previously we we studied just

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5601-1
00:28:30.915 --> 00:28:35.298
before the cosine similarity
which we we we studied the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5601-2
00:28:35.298 --> 00:28:40.229
another can we get the scenarios
or something where that which

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5601-3
00:28:40.229 --> 00:28:44.846
scenario we will use the cosine
similarity on the previous

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5601-4
00:28:44.846 --> 00:28:46.568
theorem like this one.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5598-0
00:28:47.738 --> 00:28:48.398
I see.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5625-0
00:28:48.498 --> 00:28:52.212
See in both because one thing I
told you in cosine similarity

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5625-1
00:28:52.212 --> 00:28:54.128
applies only in limited context.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5655-0
00:28:54.138 --> 00:28:58.616
When you have all the numeric
attributes and you can represent

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5655-1
00:28:58.616 --> 00:29:03.164
it like a normal vector with all
of them are scaled in the same

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5655-2
00:29:03.164 --> 00:29:03.448
way.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5703-0
00:29:03.958 --> 00:29:07.175
But if it is a complex
attribute, for example you are

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5665-0
00:29:04.298 --> 00:29:04.608
Umm.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5703-1
00:29:07.175 --> 00:29:10.689
taking two people and you're
considering one is the gender

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5703-2
00:29:10.689 --> 00:29:14.620
and other is the profession, and
then you are considering the age

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5703-3
00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:17.598
and then education and maybe
many other criteria.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5714-0
00:29:18.258 --> 00:29:21.318
So obviously the you cannot
create a cosine, right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5711-0
00:29:18.538 --> 00:29:18.788
Umm.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5718-0
00:29:22.948 --> 00:29:24.178
OK, OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5731-0
00:29:24.688 --> 00:29:27.888
So if we there is a OK, go
ahead.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5730-0
00:29:25.838 --> 00:29:26.538
Said one quick.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5741-0
00:29:29.858 --> 00:29:30.788
Go ahead VISHAL, go ahead.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5750-0
00:29:30.798 --> 00:29:31.458
I will go after you.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5748-0
00:29:32.268 --> 00:29:32.518
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5752-0
00:29:32.558 --> 00:29:33.058
Thank you.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5767-0
00:29:33.788 --> 00:29:40.018
So means if means means whatever
we data data we captured.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5806-0
00:29:40.228 --> 00:29:44.681
If there is a no relation
between them or you say that our

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5806-1
00:29:44.681 --> 00:29:49.511
relation between them so that we
are choosing that, how we will

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5806-2
00:29:49.511 --> 00:29:53.737
calculate the distance and how
we will calculate cosine

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5806-3
00:29:53.737 --> 00:29:54.718
similarities?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5826-0
00:29:56.668 --> 00:29:59.959
Maybe you have to help me and
and I I do not think I got it

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5826-1
00:29:59.959 --> 00:30:00.398
exactly.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5835-0
00:30:00.468 --> 00:30:02.508
Some or somebody else wants to
answer his question.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5868-0
00:30:05.118 --> 00:30:09.511
Means if I want to ask that if
we capture the data in that they

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5868-1
00:30:09.511 --> 00:30:13.148
have a means having a some means
of a single person.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5934-0
00:30:13.198 --> 00:30:17.742
We have a like a color like age
and there is a very close

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5934-1
00:30:17.742 --> 00:30:22.835
relation or something like from
medical like these a person that

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5902-0
00:30:20.878 --> 00:30:21.238
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5934-2
00:30:22.835 --> 00:30:27.927
so and the cosine, cosine we are
taking that uh means maybe that

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5934-3
00:30:27.927 --> 00:30:32.707
there is a not not much of a
single person or something like

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5934-4
00:30:32.707 --> 00:30:33.098
that.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5936-0
00:30:33.778 --> 00:30:34.448
No, no, no.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5948-0
00:30:34.518 --> 00:30:36.688
It is a single person, single
data object.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5944-0
00:30:34.598 --> 00:30:34.818
So.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5953-0
00:30:34.878 --> 00:30:35.148
Umm.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5959-0
00:30:36.698 --> 00:30:38.188
Let us forget about person.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5978-0
00:30:37.548 --> 00:30:39.758
OK. Umm.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5976-0
00:30:38.198 --> 00:30:41.045
Even if we are comparing 2
products, for example two cars,

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5976-1
00:30:41.045 --> 00:30:42.588
you will take the same approach.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6011-0
00:30:42.718 --> 00:30:46.208
OK, so now the question is that
the cosine will work only for

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/5992-0
00:30:43.478 --> 00:30:43.698
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6011-1
00:30:46.208 --> 00:30:48.628
all the attributes have got the
same type.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6019-0
00:30:48.638 --> 00:30:51.748
The numeric type and they can
all be scaled right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6018-0
00:30:50.288 --> 00:30:50.588
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6034-0
00:30:52.098 --> 00:30:55.388
So but if it is not, then you
cannot use cosine.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6050-0
00:30:55.858 --> 00:30:57.528
Mr VISHAL, are we in Singh?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6042-0
00:30:56.698 --> 00:30:57.108
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6046-0
00:30:57.298 --> 00:30:58.208
OK. OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6084-0
00:30:58.218 --> 00:31:01.645
Now, yeah, OK, now I understood
that like there you take in that

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6084-1
00:31:01.645 --> 00:31:04.228
it's a male female that is a not
a numeric data.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6087-0
00:31:04.038 --> 00:31:05.938
They then you cannot reuse a
cosine.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6090-0
00:31:04.578 --> 00:31:05.328
And here.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6092-0
00:31:05.438 --> 00:31:06.888
Here cosine here.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6102-0
00:31:05.948 --> 00:31:06.588
They yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6096-0
00:31:06.938 --> 00:31:07.228
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6098-0
00:31:07.238 --> 00:31:08.008
OK, got it.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6100-0
00:31:08.058 --> 00:31:08.328
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6108-0
00:31:08.338 --> 00:31:09.198
Thank you very much Sir.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6113-0
00:31:09.868 --> 00:31:10.278
Yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6120-0
00:31:10.488 --> 00:31:12.758
So one person you know?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6128-0
00:31:11.798 --> 00:31:12.938
Said I have a question.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6137-0
00:31:12.928 --> 00:31:14.328
Ohh Mr Santosh, go ahead. Yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6131-0
00:31:14.268 --> 00:31:14.518
Yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6145-0
00:31:15.458 --> 00:31:17.848
Yes, I'm in actually, in
parallel.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6168-0
00:31:17.858 --> 00:31:20.730
We are also having a same
concept discussed in

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6168-1
00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:24.213
mathematics, so it is inline to
that just to concrete my

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6168-2
00:31:24.213 --> 00:31:25.068
understanding.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6215-0
00:31:25.178 --> 00:31:29.992
So when we say similarity, does
it means that these vectors that

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6215-1
00:31:29.992 --> 00:31:34.286
we are finding the similarity
they fall in the same plane

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6215-2
00:31:34.286 --> 00:31:36.878
mathematically and the
dissimilar?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6206-0
00:31:35.728 --> 00:31:36.928
Ohh Mr Santosh.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6212-0
00:31:36.938 --> 00:31:37.628
No, no, no, no.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6218-0
00:31:37.638 --> 00:31:38.488
Just one minute.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6242-0
00:31:38.598 --> 00:31:41.648
The I I I'm sure in mathematics
they will explain it that way,

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6242-1
00:31:41.648 --> 00:31:43.488
but let me explain it in another
way.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6285-0
00:31:43.798 --> 00:31:47.320
Suppose that you have been hired
by some agency to say in

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6285-1
00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:51.266
American voters how many voters
are going to vote for Republican

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6285-2
00:31:51.266 --> 00:31:54.848
Party and how many are going to
vote for Democratic Party.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6291-0
00:31:55.418 --> 00:31:57.268
You somehow have to solve the
problem.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6296-0
00:31:57.278 --> 00:31:57.708
Is it not?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6303-0
00:31:57.718 --> 00:31:59.348
You need to distinguish the
people.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6316-0
00:31:59.358 --> 00:32:01.878
Are they likely to fit into one
basket or the other?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6322-0
00:32:02.768 --> 00:32:04.728
So so is this clear?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6346-0
00:32:06.658 --> 00:32:10.238
And I and I I was trying to just
concrete the.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6362-0
00:32:09.148 --> 00:32:12.280
So now obviously if there is a
maximum distance, you know that

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6362-1
00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:15.213
the these two people are, surely
they're going to vote for

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6362-2
00:32:15.213 --> 00:32:16.108
different parties.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6364-0
00:32:18.558 --> 00:32:18.998
Umm.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6388-0
00:32:21.108 --> 00:32:25.915
Order or it can be something
like when you got a really fancy

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6388-1
00:32:25.915 --> 00:32:26.458
gadget.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6410-0
00:32:26.578 --> 00:32:30.178
So you you were company is
launching a fancy gadget and

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6410-1
00:32:30.178 --> 00:32:34.098
among the customers you want to
choose who is likely to buy?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6426-0
00:32:34.108 --> 00:32:36.823
Suppose you already have some
sample of customers who are

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6426-1
00:32:36.823 --> 00:32:37.478
likely to buy.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6447-0
00:32:37.728 --> 00:32:41.157
So obviously if another customer
is there that details do not

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6447-1
00:32:41.157 --> 00:32:43.978
match simply with the customers
who are buying it.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6481-0
00:32:44.348 --> 00:32:47.691
So you are not going to send a
brochure and you are not going

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6481-1
00:32:47.691 --> 00:32:51.087
to send a salesperson to that
persons house to demonstrate the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6481-2
00:32:51.087 --> 00:32:51.518
product.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6484-0
00:32:51.528 --> 00:32:51.668
Right.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6492-0
00:32:53.048 --> 00:32:54.188
Mr Santosh, are we In Sync?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6501-0
00:32:53.088 --> 00:32:55.478
Right, yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6515-0
00:32:55.158 --> 00:32:58.176
So that is what the data
scientist is possibly the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6515-1
00:32:58.176 --> 00:33:01.608
organization looks up the data
scientist for saying that.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6532-0
00:33:01.618 --> 00:33:04.483
Can you organize the data in
such a way that it helps us

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6532-1
00:33:04.483 --> 00:33:05.538
making the decisions?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6545-0
00:33:07.908 --> 00:33:08.168
Alright.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6549-0
00:33:07.978 --> 00:33:10.358
Mr Santosh, are we In Sync or am
I losing?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6593-0
00:33:12.558 --> 00:33:15.558
And I understood your point,
Sir, and just trying to tie up

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6593-1
00:33:15.558 --> 00:33:18.058
what we have learned
mathematically, but it's OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6580-0
00:33:16.758 --> 00:33:17.168
No, no.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6615-0
00:33:17.178 --> 00:33:20.181
I'm sure in mathematics they may
be talking in same terms, but

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6615-1
00:33:20.181 --> 00:33:23.231
now if you bring in a plane and
you want me to explain it in A3

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6615-2
00:33:23.231 --> 00:33:24.708
dimensional plane and all that.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6625-0
00:33:24.798 --> 00:33:26.488
So I don't want to go into that.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6630-0
00:33:26.498 --> 00:33:27.128
So.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6647-0
00:33:27.178 --> 00:33:30.548
So The thing is that yes, so The
thing is that that will help.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6642-0
00:33:27.208 --> 00:33:28.228
Sure, sure. OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6700-0
00:33:30.558 --> 00:33:34.246
That will surely plane is
important concept but but our

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6700-1
00:33:34.246 --> 00:33:38.196
intention is to to get these
things so that we will go into

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6700-2
00:33:38.196 --> 00:33:41.950
the algorithms because our
intention is not to stop with

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6700-3
00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:45.374
the distance because our
intention is that once you

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6700-4
00:33:45.374 --> 00:33:48.468
understand the distance then we
will help you.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6730-0
00:33:48.738 --> 00:33:52.793
But we will start discussing the
algorithms that will that will

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6730-1
00:33:52.793 --> 00:33:56.531
be helpful for solving various
types of problems that data

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6730-2
00:33:56.531 --> 00:33:58.938
scientists can will be coming
across.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6732-0
00:34:00.668 --> 00:34:01.018
Right.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6735-0
00:34:01.088 --> 00:34:01.548
Thank you, Sir.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6741-0
00:34:05.338 --> 00:34:05.688
No.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6789-0
00:34:05.978 --> 00:34:11.030
So that and the previous slide,
so that from the value that .94

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6789-1
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:16.004
so which means it has that that
much similarity that comparing

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6789-2
00:34:16.004 --> 00:34:17.898
the tool document right.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6779-0
00:34:16.318 --> 00:34:17.048
That is correct.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6787-0
00:34:17.098 --> 00:34:17.808
That is correct.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6796-0
00:34:17.878 --> 00:34:19.108
Yes, similarity, right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6810-0
00:34:18.428 --> 00:34:22.668
So if it is that is like 90%
similarity .94.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6808-0
00:34:21.988 --> 00:34:23.118
Not 90%.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6840-0
00:34:23.488 --> 00:34:27.865
We don't go that way, but then
compare the similarity and then

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6840-1
00:34:27.865 --> 00:34:31.548
say that if the similarity of
.94 is better than the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6840-2
00:34:31.548 --> 00:34:32.798
similarity of .85.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6843-0
00:34:33.248 --> 00:34:34.018
So.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6862-0
00:34:34.128 --> 00:34:37.858
So saying that because see for
example let us go back to the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6862-1
00:34:37.858 --> 00:34:38.958
again the problem.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6894-0
00:34:39.048 --> 00:34:43.756
So we you have to sell for your
company makes fancy gadgets and

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6894-1
00:34:43.756 --> 00:34:48.317
you got the list of customers
who are likely to like who have

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6894-2
00:34:48.317 --> 00:34:50.818
already bought that fancy
gadget.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6903-0
00:34:50.828 --> 00:34:52.068
It's a very expensive gadget.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6925-0
00:34:52.208 --> 00:34:56.217
Let's say it costs ₹5,00,000 and
and it it is liked by only

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6925-1
00:34:56.217 --> 00:34:58.688
people with certain
characteristics.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6948-0
00:34:59.138 --> 00:35:03.041
So now the point is that you
have got a customer database of

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6948-1
00:35:03.041 --> 00:35:05.728
some other million customers in
the town.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6979-0
00:35:06.098 --> 00:35:09.213
Obviously you look for the
maximum similarity with the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6979-1
00:35:09.213 --> 00:35:12.553
customers who already bought
before you send your salesman

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6979-2
00:35:12.553 --> 00:35:14.988
and promote the product because
you don't.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6999-0
00:35:14.998 --> 00:35:18.020
Your company doesn't want to
spend money with selling it to

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/6999-1
00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:20.438
everybody going after
everybody's army In Sync.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7004-0
00:35:22.398 --> 00:35:22.978
Yeah. Yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7016-0
00:35:24.258 --> 00:35:27.338
So don't go with the 95% for.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7053-0
00:35:27.408 --> 00:35:31.141
So for example, if your company
is in a very, very desperate

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7053-1
00:35:31.141 --> 00:35:34.567
state that you have to acquire
the customer, so even .8

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7053-2
00:35:34.567 --> 00:35:38.238
similarity, they will send
somebody to promote the product.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7098-0
00:35:38.608 --> 00:35:42.130
But if there is so much demand
that your customer is your

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7098-1
00:35:42.130 --> 00:35:45.955
company is unable to service the
customers unless the customer

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7098-2
00:35:45.955 --> 00:35:49.658
has .99 similarity, then you
don't want to even talk to him.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7116-0
00:35:49.728 --> 00:35:52.110
Or you may even want don't want
to talk to anybody because the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7116-1
00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:53.508
customers are anyway walking to
you.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7133-0
00:35:54.178 --> 00:35:57.199
I I don't know this this because
you are trying to solve some

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7133-1
00:35:57.199 --> 00:35:57.588
problem.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7139-0
00:35:57.598 --> 00:35:58.728
It is not really.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7148-0
00:35:58.798 --> 00:36:00.748
You are looking at the numbers
for the sake of it.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7159-0
00:36:05.378 --> 00:36:07.428
Let's look at the numerical
data.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7172-0
00:36:07.808 --> 00:36:11.498
So we will see how to handle the
numerical data.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7187-0
00:36:11.798 --> 00:36:16.908
So suppose that we have got data
which is a numerical data.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7202-0
00:36:16.918 --> 00:36:22.594
One example that comes promptly
is suppose we have customer one

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7202-1
00:36:22.594 --> 00:36:22.948
and.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7214-0
00:36:28.378 --> 00:36:31.808
You have got 3 customers or
three employees or what?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7224-0
00:36:31.858 --> 00:36:33.358
OK, so there is an income.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7239-0
00:36:34.688 --> 00:36:38.458
So five one person has an income
of let's say 5,00,000.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7255-0
00:36:38.828 --> 00:36:43.618
Another person has 50 lacs and
another person has 10 lacks and

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7255-1
00:36:43.618 --> 00:36:44.758
one person has.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7264-0
00:36:44.848 --> 00:36:46.478
Let me put it as 25,00,000.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7275-0
00:36:46.688 --> 00:36:49.198
OK, so now there are four
people.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7290-0
00:36:49.248 --> 00:36:52.611
Each person has got a different
income, so you can solve it in

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7290-1
00:36:52.611 --> 00:36:53.518
many ways, right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7305-0
00:36:54.028 --> 00:36:57.638
So how do you distinguish them
and how to compare the distance?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7325-0
00:36:57.648 --> 00:37:00.504
Because you need to compare the,
you need to make the distance

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7325-1
00:37:00.504 --> 00:37:01.818
measurement for some problem.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7334-0
00:37:02.048 --> 00:37:03.878
So let's not worry about the
problem.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7357-0
00:37:03.988 --> 00:37:07.788
So no one way is that you we
simply take it as a numeric and

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7357-1
00:37:07.788 --> 00:37:09.408
then compute the distance.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7390-0
00:37:09.818 --> 00:37:13.525
But of course we have to scale
it because the scale of income

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7390-1
00:37:13.525 --> 00:37:16.933
is not good or other thing is
that can we call it into a

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7390-2
00:37:16.933 --> 00:37:18.308
categorical attributes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7399-0
00:37:18.598 --> 00:37:22.248
So can we say that the income is
categories?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7428-0
00:37:25.528 --> 00:37:30.168
Income category it's a low
income, high income and middle

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7428-1
00:37:30.168 --> 00:37:34.888
income and maybe this also will
put it as a middle income.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7450-0
00:37:35.818 --> 00:37:40.487
So now we converted the income
into 3 distinct categories and

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7450-1
00:37:40.487 --> 00:37:43.348
this has become an ordinal
attribute.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7455-0
00:37:43.558 --> 00:37:44.258
So yell.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7472-0
00:37:44.268 --> 00:37:47.808
Hmm is an ordinal attribute and
use that to compute distance.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7493-0
00:37:48.678 --> 00:37:53.341
Or we can use the combine,
convert the data simply into a

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7493-1
00:37:53.341 --> 00:37:54.788
binary attributes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7530-0
00:37:55.038 --> 00:37:58.487
So for example, we are saying
that we think the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7530-1
00:37:58.487 --> 00:38:02.797
differentiators the gadget will
be bought by people who are

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7530-2
00:38:02.797 --> 00:38:06.748
likely to have a salary more
than ₹20,00,000 per year.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7544-0
00:38:07.258 --> 00:38:10.758
So now what we say is that now
let's do with.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7554-0
00:38:10.938 --> 00:38:13.898
So this person is likely to buy
the gadget.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7564-0
00:38:13.908 --> 00:38:15.548
This person is likely to buy the
gadget.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7572-0
00:38:15.558 --> 00:38:16.988
This person will not buy the
gadget.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7578-0
00:38:16.998 --> 00:38:18.928
This person is not so.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7583-0
00:38:18.938 --> 00:38:20.068
Now forget about the income.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7638-0
00:38:20.078 --> 00:38:23.476
We got a binary attribute and
beyond this we can also think in

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7638-1
00:38:23.476 --> 00:38:26.820
terms of scaling the scaling
this we have already seen and we

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7638-2
00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:29.678
will also see some more methods
of scaling the data.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7669-0
00:38:30.738 --> 00:38:35.862
So scaling the data is simple,
scaling is I I'm going to

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7669-1
00:38:35.862 --> 00:38:40.986
convert this the the min, Max
scaling 50 -, 545 I divide

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7669-2
00:38:40.986 --> 00:38:46.560
everything by 45 and I'm going
to get the values somewhere in

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7669-3
00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:47.818
the zero to 1.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7671-0
00:38:49.418 --> 00:38:49.658
Right.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7683-0
00:38:52.268 --> 00:38:54.478
So so that can be one approach.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7688-0
00:38:54.488 --> 00:38:57.028
Scaling scaling can take
multiple approaches.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7696-0
00:38:57.038 --> 00:38:58.018
We are going to see that.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7707-0
00:38:58.028 --> 00:38:59.518
How are we going to do the
scaling?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7731-0
00:39:00.108 --> 00:39:04.215
So so we we can understand that
there are two ways 2 distinct

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7731-1
00:39:04.215 --> 00:39:06.798
ways other than the scaling we
can do.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7739-0
00:39:06.868 --> 00:39:08.638
And the third one is
normalization.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7756-0
00:39:08.648 --> 00:39:10.338
That scaling is we are going to
see.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7784-0
00:39:11.038 --> 00:39:15.800
So so all of this are approaches
for handling the numeric data,

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7784-1
00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:20.413
and another concern that we may
have with the numeric data is

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7784-2
00:39:20.413 --> 00:39:24.728
that for example, we are
receiving data from 100 sensors.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7790-0
00:39:25.108 --> 00:39:27.068
So this is 100 IT sensors.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7808-0
00:39:30.748 --> 00:39:34.898
And now let us say they are
sending the data after every one

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7808-1
00:39:34.898 --> 00:39:35.238
hour.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7817-0
00:39:35.248 --> 00:39:37.328
So we have accumulated huge
data.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7831-0
00:39:37.338 --> 00:39:40.928
I mean, it is possible that for
some problems we may have

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7831-1
00:39:40.928 --> 00:39:41.918
million sensors.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7849-0
00:39:41.928 --> 00:39:46.241
So so now the point is that so
they are sending the data of the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7849-1
00:39:46.241 --> 00:39:46.578
form.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7858-0
00:39:46.808 --> 00:39:52.568
So let's say 9 point 379.41.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7864-0
00:39:54.878 --> 00:39:57.948
9.39.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7872-0
00:40:00.028 --> 00:40:01.758
9.38.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7900-0
00:40:02.588 --> 00:40:07.712
So now we can capture the data
as it is, but then you can also

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7900-1
00:40:07.712 --> 00:40:12.348
suspect as a data scientist
saying that all the sensors.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7906-0
00:40:16.488 --> 00:40:21.748
Or not equally accurate.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7909-0
00:40:21.828 --> 00:40:22.168
Great.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7935-0
00:40:25.008 --> 00:40:30.665
So it is possible that the
actual data is 9.4, but all of

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7935-1
00:40:30.665 --> 00:40:34.858
them are putting it into
different values.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7953-0
00:40:36.388 --> 00:40:40.153
So now you don't ask me, how do
I know that the sensors

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7953-1
00:40:40.153 --> 00:40:40.758
accuracy?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7997-0
00:40:40.968 --> 00:40:44.499
So the point is that we when we
get the data, we get the data

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7997-1
00:40:44.499 --> 00:40:47.801
from so many sources that we
miss sometimes when we get a

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7997-2
00:40:47.801 --> 00:40:51.445
data from research agencies, the
research agency will not share

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/7997-3
00:40:51.445 --> 00:40:53.438
the method of collecting the
data.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8014-0
00:40:53.448 --> 00:40:56.954
They only say that, OK, we will
sell the data for this price you

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8014-1
00:40:56.954 --> 00:40:57.978
are willing to pay.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8026-0
00:40:57.988 --> 00:41:01.538
Take the, otherwise leave it so
that is.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8040-0
00:41:01.548 --> 00:41:05.520
That happens for many times
because they they have their

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8040-1
00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:05.798
own.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8059-0
00:41:05.888 --> 00:41:11.110
They have their own uh clauses
of privacy and others so they

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8059-1
00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:14.448
cannot tell the source of
information.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8082-0
00:41:14.998 --> 00:41:20.491
So in such cases, so you and
obviously you, you may not trust

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8082-1
00:41:20.491 --> 00:41:23.148
the 100% accuracy of the data.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8105-0
00:41:23.158 --> 00:41:27.607
So that it is possible that when
they collect the data, some

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8105-1
00:41:27.607 --> 00:41:29.868
possible errors may have topic.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8108-0
00:41:30.348 --> 00:41:30.988
So.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8120-0
00:41:31.058 --> 00:41:33.698
So now what we are saying is
that we will do a smoothing.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8132-0
00:41:36.558 --> 00:41:38.358
So a numeric attributes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8141-0
00:41:38.368 --> 00:41:41.848
So this is representing 1
popular very popular database.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8155-0
00:41:41.858 --> 00:41:46.349
So many people use this data set
to solve many data science

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8155-1
00:41:46.349 --> 00:41:46.948
methods.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8176-0
00:41:47.058 --> 00:41:50.991
Check the many data science
methods so this data set is

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8176-1
00:41:50.991 --> 00:41:53.448
available at many public
websites.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8188-0
00:41:53.868 --> 00:41:56.598
So Pima Indians diabetes
database.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8193-0
00:41:56.898 --> 00:41:58.548
So this is indicating.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8203-0
00:41:58.798 --> 00:42:03.688
So this is the this is the
presence or absence of diabetes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8207-0
00:42:09.908 --> 00:42:11.078
Of disease.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8226-0
00:42:13.288 --> 00:42:16.992
And we are looking at many
attributes and I'm not sure

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8226-1
00:42:16.992 --> 00:42:18.338
whether this is the.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8256-0
00:42:18.348 --> 00:42:21.925
I think this is the complete
set, but I'm I'm I I can't

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8256-1
00:42:21.925 --> 00:42:25.948
recollect so there may be more
attributes also so please spare

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8256-2
00:42:25.948 --> 00:42:26.778
me from that.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8284-0
00:42:27.088 --> 00:42:30.966
So this is representing the
types of attributes that you

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8284-1
00:42:30.966 --> 00:42:34.707
that they doctors thought or
important to characterize

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8284-2
00:42:34.707 --> 00:42:37.768
whether a person has got the
disease or not.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8318-0
00:42:38.508 --> 00:42:43.000
So, so so this is the this is
what you can see is that many

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8318-1
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.792
attributes are numeric but many
of these attributes have got it

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8318-2
00:42:47.792 --> 00:42:49.738
different types of ranges.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8355-0
00:42:50.158 --> 00:42:54.602
So number of pregnancies that
person went through can be is a

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8355-1
00:42:54.602 --> 00:42:58.688
smaller number, but glucose
level is a bigger number and

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8355-2
00:42:58.688 --> 00:43:02.128
then the age is in a different
range by itself.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8364-0
00:43:02.168 --> 00:43:05.138
Blood pressure has its own
range, so.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8386-0
00:43:05.198 --> 00:43:08.620
So for example, if you take some
count of some RBC or something,

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8386-1
00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:11.568
it may come out to be much
wider, much different range.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8411-0
00:43:12.338 --> 00:43:15.755
So so you need to think of
numeric attributes with diverse

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8411-1
00:43:15.755 --> 00:43:19.229
range and for that region we
need to think of preprocessing

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8411-2
00:43:19.229 --> 00:43:19.518
that.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8439-0
00:43:21.788 --> 00:43:26.540
So one web approach we said is
that discretization, so

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8439-1
00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:32.242
discretization is to is possibly
can be converted can be based on

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8439-2
00:43:32.242 --> 00:43:33.278
some ranges.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8462-0
00:43:33.628 --> 00:43:37.312
So suppose we take the age and
we are going to create these

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8462-1
00:43:37.312 --> 00:43:40.628
discrete ranges or we can create
a conceptual labels.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8477-0
00:43:44.648 --> 00:43:48.751
So so this can be the very
simple steps of doing a

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8477-1
00:43:48.751 --> 00:43:49.958
discretization.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8496-0
00:43:49.968 --> 00:43:53.225
So all we got is that in the
previous example, we got the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8496-1
00:43:53.225 --> 00:43:53.618
income.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8543-0
00:43:54.028 --> 00:43:58.838
So we decided that anybody
having the income greater than a

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8543-1
00:43:58.838 --> 00:44:04.048
greater than five 7,00,000 is a
middle income less than 7,00,000

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8543-2
00:44:04.048 --> 00:44:09.258
is low in low income and greater
than 30 greater than 22,00,000.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8548-0
00:44:09.668 --> 00:44:10.818
That's what I said, right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8552-0
00:44:10.928 --> 00:44:11.458
That's what.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8563-0
00:44:11.568 --> 00:44:13.318
OK, 25, we put it as middle
income.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8572-0
00:44:13.368 --> 00:44:15.238
So greater than 30,00,000 is
high income.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8579-0
00:44:15.248 --> 00:44:17.568
So let's say so very simple.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8594-0
00:44:17.618 --> 00:44:19.778
Then we convert same thing we
can do with the age.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8605-0
00:44:20.848 --> 00:44:23.828
Sir, I have a question here like
so.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8608-0
00:44:22.618 --> 00:44:23.358
Yes, yes, go ahead.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8617-0
00:44:23.888 --> 00:44:27.758
Are we not biasing in terms of
the categorization right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8641-0
00:44:27.768 --> 00:44:31.516
How are we coming into the
categories like for example zero

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8641-1
00:44:31.516 --> 00:44:33.078
to 25 Lake is 1 category.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8649-0
00:44:33.088 --> 00:44:34.618
Maybe it is for this population.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8670-0
00:44:34.628 --> 00:44:37.798
It is low category or Academy
maybe for some.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8662-0
00:44:37.008 --> 00:44:37.778
That is right.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8689-0
00:44:37.788 --> 00:44:41.470
That is right to Mr Party that
actually you can the the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8689-1
00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:45.218
labeling that you take is also
dependent on the problem.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8707-0
00:44:45.628 --> 00:44:49.618
Because for one problem or
certain labels may work well,

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8707-1
00:44:49.618 --> 00:44:51.858
but for other problems they may.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8750-0
00:44:51.868 --> 00:44:56.067
For example, if you are willing
to buy a a fancy gadget of very

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8750-1
00:44:56.067 --> 00:44:59.544
expensive size, the way you
categorize the income is

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8750-2
00:44:59.544 --> 00:45:03.086
different from when the
government has to look at the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8750-3
00:45:03.086 --> 00:45:06.038
people who should be given free
rise. Right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8754-0
00:45:06.408 --> 00:45:06.918
So.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8777-0
00:45:06.928 --> 00:45:11.079
So The thing is that the purpose
will differentiate the the way

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8777-1
00:45:11.079 --> 00:45:13.608
you go about are we In Sync, Mr
Paris?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8779-0
00:45:14.328 --> 00:45:14.848
Yeah, sure.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8780-0
00:45:15.688 --> 00:45:16.008
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8802-0
00:45:25.108 --> 00:45:28.922
So these are the simple steps
whereby we are going to create

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8802-1
00:45:28.922 --> 00:45:30.798
the where concept here labels.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8815-0
00:45:30.948 --> 00:45:33.689
It is also possible that we
don't stop with the conceptual

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8815-1
00:45:33.689 --> 00:45:33.968
label.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8835-0
00:45:33.978 --> 00:45:37.915
We may create a conceptual
hierarchy, so we have said that,

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8835-1
00:45:37.915 --> 00:45:39.358
let us say the income.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8843-0
00:45:39.888 --> 00:45:42.528
So now let me go into income.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8866-0
00:45:45.198 --> 00:45:48.841
At very high level, I divided
into three groups list, saying

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8866-1
00:45:48.841 --> 00:45:51.708
that low income, middle income
and high income.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8917-0
00:45:52.038 --> 00:45:56.370
So the middle income, I can say
that the lower middle class and

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8917-1
00:45:56.370 --> 00:46:00.363
upper middle class, which you
may have heard many times in

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8917-2
00:46:00.363 --> 00:46:04.085
many, many of the financial
contexts saying that upper

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8917-3
00:46:04.085 --> 00:46:08.011
middle class is is nowadays
doing this and a lower middle

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8917-4
00:46:08.011 --> 00:46:08.958
class is this.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8926-0
00:46:08.968 --> 00:46:11.588
And all this similarly among the
high income groups.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8933-0
00:46:11.878 --> 00:46:13.598
So you can say that ultra high.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8939-0
00:46:15.768 --> 00:46:17.428
And simple high.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8956-0
00:46:17.728 --> 00:46:21.436
So for example, you cannot
compare high income group, for

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8956-1
00:46:21.436 --> 00:46:23.098
example somebody you make.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8998-0
00:46:23.188 --> 00:46:26.823
If that person has an income of
₹1,00,00,000, you may say it is

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8998-1
00:46:26.823 --> 00:46:30.288
a high income group, but then
you cannot compare that person

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/8998-2
00:46:30.288 --> 00:46:33.468
with let's play, say like the
ambanis or Adonis. Right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9003-0
00:46:34.388 --> 00:46:34.938
So.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9023-0
00:46:34.948 --> 00:46:37.974
So in that case you may want to
create further categories

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9023-1
00:46:37.974 --> 00:46:40.008
because that your problem
requires it.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9043-0
00:46:40.108 --> 00:46:44.627
It's not because you are doing
it, because for just for the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9043-1
00:46:44.627 --> 00:46:46.058
sake of sake of it.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9079-0
00:46:46.488 --> 00:46:51.387
So in that case, what you do is
you create a concept hierarchy

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9079-1
00:46:51.387 --> 00:46:55.819
and the concept hierarchy is
very common with respect to

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9079-2
00:46:55.819 --> 00:47:00.018
things like the distances, so or
or for example, the.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9088-0
00:47:00.028 --> 00:47:02.718
You may say that the the
distance.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9144-0
00:47:02.848 --> 00:47:06.823
So for example, you may say the
intercontinental distances, then

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9144-1
00:47:06.823 --> 00:47:10.554
international distances within
the same continent and states

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9144-2
00:47:10.554 --> 00:47:14.040
the distance between the States
and distance between the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9144-3
00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:17.037
districts and within the
district you may have a

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9144-4
00:47:17.037 --> 00:47:20.828
something lower level at the
loop and then distances between.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9152-0
00:47:20.838 --> 00:47:23.058
So the point is that you create.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9169-0
00:47:23.068 --> 00:47:26.820
You can create a mini
hierarchies and that that may

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9169-1
00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:28.118
help your problem.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9176-0
00:47:28.268 --> 00:47:29.878
So it is it again.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9191-0
00:47:29.888 --> 00:47:34.467
I'm leaving it that it you may
do it if it helps with your

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9191-1
00:47:34.467 --> 00:47:35.088
problem.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9207-0
00:47:39.778 --> 00:47:44.491
And this discretization level
can take, let's look at this

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9207-1
00:47:44.491 --> 00:47:46.728
supervised and unsupervised.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9220-0
00:47:47.098 --> 00:47:50.878
So now, now let me give a very
simple example.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9233-0
00:47:50.888 --> 00:47:56.748
Just to close this so I have got
one category saying that income.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9250-0
00:48:00.188 --> 00:48:05.598
And we kill the person has so
income, let's say in 1000.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9298-0
00:48:05.608 --> 00:48:12.228
So let's say 10,000 and the
person is riding a motorcycle,

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9298-1
00:48:12.228 --> 00:48:17.949
then 20,000 the person is
writing a car 30,000 his

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9298-2
00:48:17.949 --> 00:48:24.008
motorcycle, 40,000 is
motorcycle, 50,000 is car, then

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9298-3
00:48:24.008 --> 00:48:26.588
55,000 is a motorcycle.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9314-0
00:48:27.118 --> 00:48:32.351
Then 60,000 is writing a car, so
now is it helping you to do a

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9314-1
00:48:32.351 --> 00:48:34.178
discretization or not?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9323-0
00:48:41.948 --> 00:48:42.128
No.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9326-0
00:48:42.628 --> 00:48:43.528
Somebody give an answer?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9329-0
00:48:43.148 --> 00:48:43.458
No.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9330-0
00:48:44.588 --> 00:48:46.318
No. Why?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9328-0
00:48:44.838 --> 00:48:44.978
No.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9362-0
00:48:48.598 --> 00:48:52.675
Because you can see that the
people below this income tending

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9340-0
00:48:49.088 --> 00:48:49.198
You.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9362-1
00:48:52.675 --> 00:48:56.621
to buy go by motorcycle and
above this income or tending to

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9362-2
00:48:56.621 --> 00:48:57.278
go by car.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9375-0
00:49:01.958 --> 00:49:04.228
You can always find the
exceptions that that is.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9425-0
00:49:04.238 --> 00:49:08.398
In fact, I put it deliberately
to exceptions because you you

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9425-1
00:49:08.398 --> 00:49:12.693
should recognize that when you
get the data, you cannot simply

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9425-2
00:49:12.693 --> 00:49:17.125
assume that the data is going to
give work like a Bible for you,

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9425-3
00:49:17.125 --> 00:49:21.148
because it is possible that this
because one thing is see.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9449-0
00:49:21.158 --> 00:49:24.021
First thing is that you assume
that income is going to impact

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9449-1
00:49:24.021 --> 00:49:26.837
whether the person will what
type of vehicle the person will

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9449-2
00:49:26.837 --> 00:49:27.068
have.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9456-0
00:49:27.238 --> 00:49:28.588
OK, that is the assumption.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9507-0
00:49:28.798 --> 00:49:32.310
So now let us say that
assumption still you hold it,

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9507-1
00:49:32.310 --> 00:49:36.352
but then it is possible that
this person with 20K income has

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9507-2
00:49:36.352 --> 00:49:40.328
got a father with who is very
rich and this person with 55K

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9507-3
00:49:40.328 --> 00:49:42.978
income has got lot of
responsibilities.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9530-0
00:49:42.988 --> 00:49:47.050
So it is quite possible that you
there are exceptions, but in

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9530-1
00:49:47.050 --> 00:49:48.688
spite of that there is a.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9538-0
00:49:48.738 --> 00:49:51.358
This is helping you to give a
supervised discretization.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9541-0
00:49:52.478 --> 00:49:52.888
Are we?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9545-0
00:49:52.898 --> 00:49:53.458
Are we In Sync?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9567-0
00:49:57.178 --> 00:50:01.090
Yeah, the data is is a low
value, so it was hard to you

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9567-1
00:50:01.090 --> 00:50:02.208
know categories.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9572-0
00:50:03.208 --> 00:50:04.438
No, but then, OK, I'll.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9583-0
00:50:04.448 --> 00:50:07.338
I'll put some more value just to
make you comfortable.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9587-0
00:50:07.588 --> 00:50:10.198
OK, one more value.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9622-0
00:50:10.828 --> 00:50:14.934
So you can make out that yes,
there is a tendency below 45 K

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9622-1
00:50:14.934 --> 00:50:19.309
people tend to have a motorcycle
and they above 45 K people tend

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9622-2
00:50:19.309 --> 00:50:20.588
to have car, right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9626-0
00:50:23.108 --> 00:50:23.228
Yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9640-0
00:50:23.278 --> 00:50:23.348
Yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9643-0
00:50:24.838 --> 00:50:27.808
So so now that is become a
supervised discretization.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9695-0
00:50:27.938 --> 00:50:31.966
So the numbers are not telling,
but you have another class label

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9695-1
00:50:31.966 --> 00:50:35.809
that you are saying that OK, the
way that the type of vehicle

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9695-2
00:50:35.809 --> 00:50:39.713
that person drives is a you are
treating that as a class label

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9695-3
00:50:39.713 --> 00:50:43.555
and then that is giving you a
supervision with respect to how

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9695-4
00:50:43.555 --> 00:50:44.918
to discretize the ink.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9697-0
00:50:46.998 --> 00:50:47.318
Alright.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9761-0
00:50:49.398 --> 00:50:53.097
This is this is supervised and
you can also have unsupervised

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9761-1
00:50:53.097 --> 00:50:56.735
which is saying that do not
depend on any other class label,

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9761-2
00:50:56.735 --> 00:51:00.553
only look at the data and do the
discretization so that that is

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9761-3
00:51:00.553 --> 00:51:04.013
the two approaches to do the
discretization and these are

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9761-4
00:51:04.013 --> 00:51:07.472
these are independent and top
down and bottom up are also

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9761-5
00:51:07.472 --> 00:51:08.188
independent.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9799-0
00:51:08.198 --> 00:51:12.408
So so you can do in all the
cases all the types, so top down

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9786-0
00:51:12.028 --> 00:51:14.478
Can I have again?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9799-1
00:51:12.408 --> 00:51:15.168
is saying that you first break
up into.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9802-0
00:51:14.488 --> 00:51:16.918
I have one one example of
supervised unsupervised.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9815-0
00:51:18.108 --> 00:51:21.031
Unsupervised is don't use the
vehicle, so you do the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9815-1
00:51:21.031 --> 00:51:21.858
discretization.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9819-0
00:51:24.768 --> 00:51:25.048
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9844-0
00:51:26.058 --> 00:51:29.915
OK, then top down is that you
divide it first the people into

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9844-1
00:51:29.915 --> 00:51:32.528
low income people and high
income people.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9882-0
00:51:32.798 --> 00:51:36.038
And then within the low income
people, you started saying that

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9882-1
00:51:36.038 --> 00:51:38.815
somebody is below poverty line
and somebody is having

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9882-2
00:51:38.815 --> 00:51:41.951
marginally low income and the
high income people you divided

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9882-3
00:51:41.951 --> 00:51:44.008
them into middle class and upper
class.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9905-0
00:51:44.018 --> 00:51:46.939
So that is a top down
discretization you are going

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9905-1
00:51:46.939 --> 00:51:50.088
from the top and you are
splitting and then bottom up.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9954-0
00:51:50.198 --> 00:51:54.147
You are seeing that you are
seeing there are these things

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9954-1
00:51:54.147 --> 00:51:58.367
are very close, so I put them
into single group and these and

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9954-2
00:51:58.367 --> 00:52:02.452
so you start looking at things
which you are going to merge

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9954-3
00:52:02.452 --> 00:52:06.400
because those neighborhood
intervals you think that there

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9954-4
00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:08.578
cannot be differentiation there.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9967-0
00:52:09.358 --> 00:52:12.448
So in that case, what you are
doing is bottom up.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9991-0
00:52:12.538 --> 00:52:16.331
Your first merging some of the
intervals and then after that

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/9991-1
00:52:16.331 --> 00:52:17.948
you have a reduced number.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10015-0
00:52:18.098 --> 00:52:21.882
So previously we had eight
values, now we had only six

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10015-1
00:52:21.882 --> 00:52:25.528
values and you let's look at how
to discretize this.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10023-0
00:52:25.818 --> 00:52:27.468
So this is bottom of approach.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10043-0
00:52:30.688 --> 00:52:33.398
So here do we give a range or we
will give one number Sir.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10068-0
00:52:34.768 --> 00:52:38.587
No, the how we use it is
different thing because once you

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10068-1
00:52:38.587 --> 00:52:42.538
do it discretization, you may
decide to go with the labels.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10128-0
00:52:42.588 --> 00:52:46.056
So like the way middle income
and low income or or you may

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10128-1
00:52:46.056 --> 00:52:49.642
still keep that as a variable
because nothing stops you from

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10128-2
00:52:49.642 --> 00:52:53.404
defining a new variable saying
that a person's income is in the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10128-3
00:52:53.404 --> 00:52:57.166
range of 40 to 60 K you create a
new variable like that and you

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10128-4
00:52:57.166 --> 00:52:57.518
put Y.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10138-0
00:52:57.528 --> 00:52:59.298
If that person has income in
that range.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10159-0
00:52:59.308 --> 00:53:02.714
Otherwise, no, because you
converted in a way effectively

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10159-1
00:53:02.714 --> 00:53:05.298
into a categorical or nominal
type of feel.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10171-0
00:53:06.098 --> 00:53:08.028
So it depends or or.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10167-0
00:53:06.348 --> 00:53:06.668
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10188-0
00:53:08.038 --> 00:53:11.676
Sometime we may say that, OK, we
are all putting them together

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10188-1
00:53:11.676 --> 00:53:12.888
into a single number.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10197-0
00:53:13.318 --> 00:53:16.548
So that is that really your
problem demands it?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10229-0
00:53:16.558 --> 00:53:21.245
Maybe you you may convert that
40 and 50 and replace it by 45,

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10229-1
00:53:21.245 --> 00:53:25.709
but that that you will do it if
you think that that problem

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10229-2
00:53:25.709 --> 00:53:27.048
really demands it.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10260-0
00:53:27.098 --> 00:53:30.571
But then in that case, that may
become as well a categorical

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10260-1
00:53:30.571 --> 00:53:34.158
because you combine many of them
and put it as an average, uh.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10278-0
00:53:34.748 --> 00:53:37.798
Unless you know the range you,
you're virtually treating the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10278-1
00:53:37.798 --> 00:53:39.098
number like a categorical.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10283-0
00:53:49.398 --> 00:53:49.988
No.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10292-0
00:53:50.048 --> 00:53:55.088
Let us look at the methods of
binning.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10312-0
00:53:55.478 --> 00:53:58.933
So what we are saying is that we
said that this is a binning is

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10312-1
00:53:58.933 --> 00:54:00.498
for the purpose of smoothing.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10342-0
00:54:05.918 --> 00:54:11.446
So what we do is that we divide
them into groups or and then and

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10342-1
00:54:11.446 --> 00:54:15.953
then of course the smoothing and
it can also help in

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10342-2
00:54:15.953 --> 00:54:17.228
discretization.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10365-0
00:54:17.238 --> 00:54:20.718
So let me put it's not always
for it can serve both the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10365-1
00:54:20.718 --> 00:54:23.948
purposes, both it can smoothing
and discretization.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10370-0
00:54:24.338 --> 00:54:26.288
So now let's see.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10382-0
00:54:26.558 --> 00:54:30.348
Suppose that there is a width
that we compute.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10423-0
00:54:30.638 --> 00:54:35.809
So and then of course, this is
once you use this then it is

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10423-1
00:54:35.809 --> 00:54:41.153
sensitive to outlier because in
this case suppose that we got

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10423-2
00:54:41.153 --> 00:54:42.618
1020304050556070.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10451-0
00:54:42.988 --> 00:54:47.313
So if we take these numbers and
we create 2 bins, so one is

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10451-1
00:54:47.313 --> 00:54:51.278
below 45 and other is above 45
then that is one thing.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10499-0
00:54:51.488 --> 00:54:55.963
But now suppose that I want to
divide this into three bins

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10499-1
00:54:55.963 --> 00:55:00.590
based on equal range, so 70 -,
10 is 60, so I make 10 to 31,

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10499-2
00:55:00.590 --> 00:55:04.458
then 31 to 50 is another 151 to
70 is another one.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10515-0
00:55:04.868 --> 00:55:10.088
So in that case you have to be
watchful because there may be

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10515-1
00:55:10.088 --> 00:55:10.858
outliers.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10563-0
00:55:11.128 --> 00:55:15.726
Suppose that somehow through
through some noisy noise in the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10563-1
00:55:15.726 --> 00:55:20.474
process, you put this as a 7000
which is which is not a, which

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10563-2
00:55:20.474 --> 00:55:24.996
is actually an outlier which is
not within the types of the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10563-3
00:55:24.996 --> 00:55:27.558
analysis that you are
performing.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10573-0
00:55:28.048 --> 00:55:30.678
So now it is impacting the
range.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10581-0
00:55:31.248 --> 00:55:33.198
So we have to be watchful of
that.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10631-0
00:55:33.638 --> 00:55:38.050
So we convert the data into
equal with equal width ranges,

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10631-1
00:55:38.050 --> 00:55:42.237
equal width ranges and each
interval size is maximum to

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10631-2
00:55:42.237 --> 00:55:47.172
minimum divided by the number of
bins that we want to have or the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10631-3
00:55:47.172 --> 00:55:50.088
number of ranges that we want to
have.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10644-0
00:55:50.558 --> 00:55:53.358
We can also go for an equal
depth binning.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10669-0
00:55:53.718 --> 00:55:58.988
So what we do is that we have
suppose 9 items and we need to

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10669-1
00:55:58.988 --> 00:56:01.148
put them into three bins.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10685-0
00:56:01.518 --> 00:56:05.948
So we are going to put 333 equal
number into this.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10697-0
00:56:06.038 --> 00:56:09.468
So in that process, the range of
the bins may be different.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10707-0
00:56:09.638 --> 00:56:11.468
So now let us look at this
example.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10729-0
00:56:11.898 --> 00:56:16.771
Suppose we have got this data
and then we want to do in 2-3

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10729-1
00:56:16.771 --> 00:56:19.938
discrete categories using the
binning.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10745-0
00:56:20.388 --> 00:56:23.257
So first thing what we have to
do is that we have to sort the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10745-1
00:56:23.257 --> 00:56:23.488
data.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10816-0
00:56:27.508 --> 00:56:32.351
OK, after sorting the data then
we are going to get the range so

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10816-1
00:56:32.351 --> 00:56:36.971
so the first thing is that we
have sorted this so we have got

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10816-2
00:56:36.971 --> 00:56:41.739
to 53 to 81 after sorting it and
now what we are saying is that

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10816-3
00:56:41.739 --> 00:56:45.688
first method is equal with equal
width is that 81 -?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10825-0
00:56:45.698 --> 00:56:48.988
53 is 2828 by three is 9.33.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10866-0
00:56:49.078 --> 00:56:53.542
So what we are saying is that
the first one is 53 to 62,

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10866-1
00:56:53.542 --> 00:56:57.928
second one is 62 to 72, then the
third one is 72 to 81.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10896-0
00:56:58.338 --> 00:57:04.256
So that is the way we are
creating the range and then we

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10896-1
00:57:04.256 --> 00:57:10.173
are saying that then we are
putting this into into equal

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10896-2
00:57:10.173 --> 00:57:11.938
width categories.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10904-0
00:57:11.948 --> 00:57:14.548
So we created the the range for
each bin.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10923-0
00:57:16.528 --> 00:57:23.318
And we have put we have put the
items that belong to this.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10957-0
00:57:23.328 --> 00:57:27.375
So in this case we got three
items in bin one and we got a

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10957-1
00:57:27.375 --> 00:57:31.558
lot of 11 items in bin two and
we got 10 items in bin three.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10967-0
00:57:32.008 --> 00:57:35.298
But we can also go for equal
depth.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10972-0
00:57:35.608 --> 00:57:37.258
So we have 24 items.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/10982-0
00:57:37.328 --> 00:57:39.598
So why not divide them into
three groups?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11007-0
00:57:39.848 --> 00:57:44.433
So now we are saying that each
one group has eight and so we

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11007-1
00:57:44.433 --> 00:57:46.838
are creating 3 equal sized bins.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11020-0
00:57:47.108 --> 00:57:49.368
So the range of this bin is 14.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11032-0
00:57:50.398 --> 00:57:54.948
The range of this bin is 5 range
of this bin is 6.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11034-0
00:57:57.798 --> 00:57:58.058
Right.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11067-0
00:58:07.038 --> 00:58:12.847
Uh, so, can you read explain
this that how you divided and

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11043-0
00:58:07.578 --> 00:58:08.048
Yeah. Yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11067-1
00:58:12.847 --> 00:58:18.558
because uh, for all range are
coming different different.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11085-0
00:58:19.638 --> 00:58:23.091
Yes, yes, yes, that is what now
two methods we have learned only

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11085-1
00:58:23.091 --> 00:58:23.728
two methods.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11121-0
00:58:23.738 --> 00:58:30.097
One is equal size or one we call
it as equal frequency and then

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11121-1
00:58:30.097 --> 00:58:36.556
the other one we are calling it
as equal with OK equal width and

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11121-2
00:58:36.556 --> 00:58:37.748
equal depth.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11147-0
00:58:37.758 --> 00:58:42.034
So equal width is saying that
the range is equal and then

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11147-1
00:58:42.034 --> 00:58:46.605
equal depth is saying that the
number of elements in each bin

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11147-2
00:58:46.605 --> 00:58:47.268
is equal.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11152-0
00:58:47.318 --> 00:58:48.368
Miss Ruby, are we in Singh?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11156-0
00:58:50.668 --> 00:58:51.058
Said.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11190-0
00:58:51.068 --> 00:58:56.808
Uh, first, you are telling that
equal equal. Ohh.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11179-0
00:58:55.098 --> 00:58:56.908
No, no, just don't, Mr.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11197-0
00:58:56.918 --> 00:58:59.548
We don't talk as if I have done
some something wrong.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11212-0
00:58:59.558 --> 00:59:02.468
I'm saying this and I'm saying
that no, I'm not saying that.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11211-0
00:59:00.088 --> 00:59:01.268
No, no.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11243-0
00:59:02.478 --> 00:59:05.012
In fact, I'm telling whatever
the authors and whatever the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11243-1
00:59:05.012 --> 00:59:07.547
other data scientists say,
please tell me what is the what

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11243-2
00:59:07.547 --> 00:59:08.878
is that you did not understand?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11248-0
00:59:09.688 --> 00:59:11.538
I said I am.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11271-0
00:59:11.608 --> 00:59:15.378
I'm not able to understand that
all three the difference between

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11271-1
00:59:15.378 --> 00:59:15.958
all three.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11275-0
00:59:15.838 --> 00:59:18.028
No, no, no, no, Mr B, we try.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11288-0
00:59:18.038 --> 00:59:20.948
We looked at only two methods,
not 3 methods, 2 methods.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11311-0
00:59:20.958 --> 00:59:26.087
One is equal width and the other
is equal frequency or equal size

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11321-0
00:59:25.408 --> 00:59:27.148
Uh, so we have not done.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11311-1
00:59:26.087 --> 00:59:26.708
by size.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11345-0
00:59:26.718 --> 00:59:29.498
We are taking number of elements
in the bin should be but

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11345-1
00:59:29.498 --> 00:59:30.648
Missouri are we In Sync?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11349-0
00:59:30.318 --> 00:59:32.228
We have not understood the
weights of answer.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11344-0
00:59:30.338 --> 00:59:30.488
No.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11357-0
00:59:32.238 --> 00:59:32.818
The weight of 1.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11353-0
00:59:33.828 --> 00:59:34.118
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11358-0
00:59:34.128 --> 00:59:34.378
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11371-0
00:59:34.388 --> 00:59:36.528
Just let Mr Srinivas let us
wait.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11374-0
00:59:36.808 --> 00:59:37.438
Missouri.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11382-0
00:59:37.448 --> 00:59:38.818
Are we In Sync or are we?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11386-0
00:59:38.828 --> 00:59:39.618
Am I missing something?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11394-0
00:59:39.418 --> 00:59:41.948
Uh, no, I want to understand
both, Sir.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11419-0
00:59:42.018 --> 00:59:44.668
Once more equal wealth than we
call frequency, you can.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11410-0
00:59:43.178 --> 00:59:44.108
OK, OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11421-0
00:59:44.118 --> 00:59:45.848
I'm I'm going to that slide.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11424-0
00:59:46.038 --> 00:59:47.108
OK. This slide.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11446-0
00:59:47.118 --> 00:59:50.681
OK, so one is equal width and
other is equal depth equal depth

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11446-1
00:59:50.681 --> 00:59:52.208
is same as equal frequency.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11448-0
00:59:52.218 --> 00:59:52.878
Missouri.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11450-0
00:59:52.888 --> 00:59:53.168
Arvin.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11464-0
00:59:53.178 --> 00:59:56.828
Sync there because equal depth
and equal frequency is same.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11479-0
00:59:56.938 --> 00:59:59.908
OK, so we want same number of
elements in each bin.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11478-0
00:59:57.738 --> 00:59:58.558
OK, OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11489-0
01:00:00.258 --> 01:00:02.168
OK, so that is the intention.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11492-0
01:00:01.588 --> 01:00:01.928
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11500-0
01:00:02.178 --> 01:00:05.078
We want three bins, but then how
to divide?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11515-0
01:00:05.158 --> 01:00:08.728
We have two methods in both the
methods we are getting 3 bins.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11533-0
01:00:09.198 --> 01:00:13.164
But when we use the width to be
the same, the width of the bin

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11533-1
01:00:13.164 --> 01:00:14.108
should be same.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11563-0
01:00:14.118 --> 01:00:18.031
That is the maximum minus
minimum the value of the element

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11563-1
01:00:18.031 --> 01:00:22.276
of the maximum minus minimum has
to be same then we are getting

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11563-2
01:00:22.276 --> 01:00:23.668
different sized bins.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11579-0
01:00:24.158 --> 01:00:27.718
But when we go for equal
frequency of the bins then we

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11579-1
01:00:27.718 --> 01:00:30.048
are getting equal different
widths.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11608-0
01:00:30.098 --> 01:00:30.218
It's.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11595-0
01:00:32.678 --> 01:00:34.568
Yeah, it will deplete clear.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11620-0
01:00:34.778 --> 01:00:39.312
The different bin is clear but
equal width width is not getting

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11638-0
01:00:38.918 --> 01:00:43.258
Because see the equal width we
are computing because we got the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11620-1
01:00:39.312 --> 01:00:39.878
cleared.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11638-1
01:00:43.258 --> 01:00:45.428
maximum is 81 and minimum is 53.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11655-0
01:00:45.798 --> 01:00:50.188
We said that each each has to
get an approximately 9 size 9.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11679-0
01:00:50.468 --> 01:00:55.866
So first bin, we created 53 to
62, then second 163 to 72 third

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11679-1
01:00:55.866 --> 01:00:56.208
172.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11684-0
01:00:56.618 --> 01:00:58.678
Is that a problem the width?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11701-0
01:01:01.658 --> 01:01:03.608
Ah yes, I yes, I I guess we got.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11699-0
01:01:01.778 --> 01:01:02.108
Umm.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11723-0
01:01:03.618 --> 01:01:06.816
So basically 9 items should be
there in one bin as per the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11723-1
01:01:06.816 --> 01:01:08.388
equal bit methodology, right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11726-0
01:01:08.568 --> 01:01:09.978
No, no, no, not 9.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11760-0
01:01:09.988 --> 01:01:15.271
The range of the maximum range
of the items should be 9 little

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11744-0
01:01:13.098 --> 01:01:15.218
Like the maximum, right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11750-0
01:01:15.228 --> 01:01:15.828
Right, exactly.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11760-1
01:01:15.271 --> 01:01:16.528
bit, yeah yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11762-0
01:01:15.838 --> 01:01:16.688
Exactly that. What?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11780-0
01:01:16.378 --> 01:01:21.450
Serve with that like on bintu,
shouldn't the range be like 62

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11780-1
01:01:21.450 --> 01:01:23.168
to 71 rather than 72?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11789-0
01:01:24.818 --> 01:01:26.328
No, because there is no item.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11803-0
01:01:26.338 --> 01:01:29.368
I think with the value so 62 to
71.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11807-0
01:01:29.378 --> 01:01:30.228
Yeah, that is correct.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11828-0
01:01:30.288 --> 01:01:33.088
That is correct, because 72 is
going into the other side.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11840-0
01:01:32.908 --> 01:01:34.028
That is, yes, Sir.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11854-0
01:01:33.178 --> 01:01:37.034
It is actually saying that less
than 72 that is what that is

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11837-0
01:01:33.538 --> 01:01:33.758
Yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11854-1
01:01:37.034 --> 01:01:38.488
what it is meant to be.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11874-0
01:01:38.818 --> 01:01:43.288
So it is excluding 72, yeah,
excluding 72, yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11861-0
01:01:39.218 --> 01:01:39.838
OK, got it.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11871-0
01:01:43.368 --> 01:01:43.878
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11884-0
01:01:43.888 --> 01:01:46.518
So bracket is the means we are
excluding that value.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11892-0
01:01:46.508 --> 01:01:47.208
Yes, yes, yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11888-0
01:01:46.558 --> 01:01:47.578
OK, OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11894-0
01:01:47.848 --> 01:01:48.448
What it's about?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11896-0
01:01:50.178 --> 01:01:50.598
Yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11932-0
01:01:50.648 --> 01:01:55.192
Now I get it that in the equal
depth we are taking that equal

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11932-1
01:01:55.192 --> 01:01:59.882
equal number of elements count
and here we are taking the range

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11932-2
01:01:59.882 --> 01:02:00.468
of 9.33.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11934-0
01:02:00.298 --> 01:02:00.728
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11938-0
01:02:00.528 --> 01:02:00.948
Wow.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11961-0
01:02:00.818 --> 01:02:05.532
That is, that's yes, Mr
Srinivas, is it clear now to

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11950-0
01:02:00.988 --> 01:02:01.908
Almost nine, yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11963-0
01:02:04.358 --> 01:02:04.538
It's.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11961-1
01:02:05.532 --> 01:02:05.888
you?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11964-0
01:02:05.898 --> 01:02:06.208
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11971-0
01:02:06.218 --> 01:02:06.748
OK, fine.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11985-0
01:02:06.858 --> 01:02:07.378
Alright so.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11977-0
01:02:06.958 --> 01:02:07.338
Yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12005-0
01:02:07.068 --> 01:02:10.668
That this right is that this
slide is reduced this.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/11989-0
01:02:07.348 --> 01:02:07.698
Yes, Sir.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12003-0
01:02:07.588 --> 01:02:10.748
Excuse me, Sir, that I had a
question.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12004-0
01:02:09.658 --> 01:02:10.688
Yes, Mr cabin.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12012-0
01:02:13.058 --> 01:02:14.228
OK, you have a question.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12014-0
01:02:14.238 --> 01:02:14.498
Go ahead.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12033-0
01:02:17.218 --> 01:02:22.040
So sorry if this was explained
earlier, but why are we taking

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12033-1
01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:23.128
like 3-3 bins?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12055-0
01:02:23.138 --> 01:02:25.738
So what was the purpose for
three bins 1?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12050-0
01:02:24.958 --> 01:02:25.888
No, no, no, no.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12058-0
01:02:25.898 --> 01:02:28.248
That three is because of the
domain requirement.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12088-0
01:02:28.258 --> 01:02:32.797
So we cannot say if whenever you
can always think in terms of why

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12068-0
01:02:29.318 --> 01:02:29.588
Yet.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12082-0
01:02:32.348 --> 01:02:32.498
But.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12088-1
01:02:32.797 --> 01:02:34.928
three and why, why not five in?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12130-0
01:02:35.018 --> 01:02:40.566
Yeah, that is because, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, right,

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12092-0
01:02:35.148 --> 01:02:35.458
Right.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12117-0
01:02:35.468 --> 01:02:38.639
So it will be given right what
we want to do, like how many

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12117-1
01:02:38.639 --> 01:02:39.378
beans we want.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12122-0
01:02:39.448 --> 01:02:40.598
OK, OK, Sir.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12130-1
01:02:40.566 --> 01:02:41.078
right.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12126-0
01:02:40.608 --> 01:02:41.018
Thank you.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12133-0
01:02:41.088 --> 01:02:41.408
Thank you.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12140-0
01:02:42.198 --> 01:02:44.368
And sort of one question here.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12170-0
01:02:44.418 --> 01:02:48.030
In the second method that we saw
wherein we were distributing the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12170-1
01:02:48.030 --> 01:02:50.328
equal number of items in each
bin, right.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12167-0
01:02:50.078 --> 01:02:51.118
Right, right.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12193-0
01:02:51.008 --> 01:02:57.968
So there I noticed that the data
set is in the sorted order like.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12199-0
01:02:56.968 --> 01:02:57.848
Right, right.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12223-0
01:02:58.148 --> 01:03:01.211
Is it intentional that we are
sorting it and then dividing the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12234-0
01:03:01.058 --> 01:03:03.647
No, we have to support it
because if we want to put it

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12223-1
01:03:01.211 --> 01:03:01.988
equal number of?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12234-1
01:03:03.647 --> 01:03:05.718
into bins, we have to sort it
first, right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12235-0
01:03:06.868 --> 01:03:07.148
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12243-0
01:03:09.088 --> 01:03:09.508
Thank you, Sir.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12250-0
01:03:11.038 --> 01:03:12.878
80 ohh so one question.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12263-0
01:03:12.928 --> 01:03:16.548
The impact of outliers are we
saying that?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12266-0
01:03:16.008 --> 01:03:16.158
Yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12294-0
01:03:17.568 --> 01:03:22.362
Are we saying that in the width
method it will be spread across

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12294-1
01:03:22.362 --> 01:03:24.758
all bins but in depth only once?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12325-0
01:03:23.348 --> 01:03:28.180
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, we that
is true in in case of a equal

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12296-0
01:03:25.248 --> 01:03:25.838
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12308-0
01:03:25.988 --> 01:03:26.328
Thank you.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12325-1
01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:32.628
depth of the outlier impact is
not there but equal width.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12349-0
01:03:32.638 --> 01:03:36.932
The outlier is going to
significantly distort a A equal

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12349-1
01:03:36.932 --> 01:03:41.378
bit, binning Mr Santosh that is
the question, right? Yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12351-0
01:03:42.128 --> 01:03:43.038
Right, right.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12385-0
01:03:43.128 --> 01:03:47.309
So but in in the in the depth,
the outlier impact will be

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12359-0
01:03:43.678 --> 01:03:43.818
Yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12385-1
01:03:47.309 --> 01:03:50.768
there, but maybe we limited to
one or two bins.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12382-0
01:03:50.898 --> 01:03:51.788
One bin only?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12409-0
01:03:51.798 --> 01:03:54.793
Yeah, because we you want to
apply some process on that bin

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12409-1
01:03:54.793 --> 01:03:57.438
by smoothing or averaging then
it will be impacting.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12422-0
01:03:57.838 --> 01:04:00.728
But otherwise the binning itself
is not so much impact.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12420-0
01:04:01.998 --> 01:04:02.368
Right.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12424-0
01:04:02.378 --> 01:04:02.848
Thank you, Sir.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12427-0
01:04:06.798 --> 01:04:07.068
Sir.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12436-0
01:04:07.078 --> 01:04:08.508
But which one is the ideal one?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12451-0
01:04:08.708 --> 01:04:10.588
That if possible.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12441-0
01:04:10.568 --> 01:04:10.738
No.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12481-0
01:04:10.808 --> 01:04:15.265
Ohh no, there is nothing like a
ideal so it it really depends on

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12461-0
01:04:12.458 --> 01:04:13.168
Nothing I said.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12469-0
01:04:13.218 --> 01:04:14.098
OK, OK. Yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12481-1
01:04:15.265 --> 01:04:17.938
the the problem that we want to
solve.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12480-0
01:04:16.988 --> 01:04:17.528
Dataset.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12491-0
01:04:22.698 --> 01:04:24.488
Would you be able to relative?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12521-0
01:04:24.538 --> 01:04:28.526
Would you be able to help us and
understand in which scenario we

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12521-1
01:04:28.526 --> 01:04:32.269
should be using which binning
methodology here like where it

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12521-2
01:04:32.269 --> 01:04:33.618
would be fitting more?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12525-0
01:04:35.188 --> 01:04:36.138
Uh, see?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12532-0
01:04:36.148 --> 01:04:37.258
It is like this.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12547-0
01:04:37.368 --> 01:04:40.245
So sometimes you do the binning
only for the purpose of

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12547-1
01:04:40.245 --> 01:04:40.758
smoothing.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12592-0
01:04:40.928 --> 01:04:45.838
So for example, you have got a
data where you you see that the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12552-0
01:04:41.678 --> 01:04:41.908
Umm.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12592-1
01:04:45.838 --> 01:04:50.515
sensors may be sending the data
which is somewhat distorted

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12592-2
01:04:50.515 --> 01:04:55.269
because of the because of the
environment or some factors by

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12592-3
01:04:55.269 --> 01:04:59.088
which it's unable to make a
correct measurement.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12621-0
01:05:00.038 --> 01:05:03.812
So in such case what you do is
that you are really putting them

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12621-1
01:05:03.812 --> 01:05:07.055
into some ranges and then
smoothing them into the same

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12621-2
01:05:07.055 --> 01:05:07.468
values.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12651-0
01:05:07.928 --> 01:05:11.553
So so if the domain demands it,
then it is different, but

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12651-1
01:05:11.553 --> 01:05:15.366
otherwise you cannot say really
because there are million or

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12651-2
01:05:15.366 --> 01:05:16.428
billion problems.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12672-0
01:05:16.438 --> 01:05:21.144
So you cannot really list that
out if you bring in a problem, I

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12672-1
01:05:21.144 --> 01:05:22.908
may be able to help you.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12691-0
01:05:22.958 --> 01:05:27.288
I am though I I I don't want to
guarantee, but I need help.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12681-0
01:05:23.208 --> 01:05:23.488
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12720-0
01:05:27.818 --> 01:05:30.911
So if you put it in a canvas
with a specific problem, then we

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12702-0
01:05:28.108 --> 01:05:28.318
Sure.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12720-1
01:05:30.911 --> 01:05:32.308
mean we may be able to help.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12725-0
01:05:32.018 --> 01:05:33.928
OK, so it depends on problem.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12750-0
01:05:33.938 --> 01:05:36.738
Probably the data scientists you
have to analyze which one you

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12739-0
01:05:34.558 --> 01:05:35.418
Yeah, absolutely, that's.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12750-1
01:05:36.738 --> 01:05:38.738
feel is better in this
particular situation.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12758-0
01:05:39.158 --> 01:05:40.158
That is correct, right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12753-0
01:05:40.548 --> 01:05:40.838
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12763-0
01:05:41.248 --> 01:05:41.648
Thank you, Sir.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12778-0
01:05:41.918 --> 01:05:46.367
Still another way of doing a
discretization is with the help

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12778-1
01:05:46.367 --> 01:05:47.388
of histograms.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12787-0
01:05:47.898 --> 01:05:49.788
So histograms are very common
things.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12832-0
01:05:49.798 --> 01:05:54.107
All of us have used it in many
contexts, so all we are saying

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12832-1
01:05:54.107 --> 01:05:58.624
is that we plot histogram and so
histogram is effectively acting

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12832-2
01:05:58.624 --> 01:06:02.098
like a bin that though
histograms, we use them in

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12832-3
01:06:02.098 --> 01:06:04.808
different terminology which is
bucket.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12855-0
01:06:05.218 --> 01:06:09.502
So so we are looking at the
histograms and the histogram is

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12855-1
01:06:09.502 --> 01:06:12.858
telling us the thing pretty much
like the bin.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12895-0
01:06:13.178 --> 01:06:17.661
So when we take an equal width,
this is what we are getting when

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12895-1
01:06:17.661 --> 01:06:21.937
it is equal frequency, we are
getting this type of ranges and

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12895-2
01:06:21.937 --> 01:06:25.178
we can use the same like the
binning analysis.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12902-0
01:06:25.188 --> 01:06:28.748
We can use this in order to
proceed further.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12911-0
01:06:32.348 --> 01:06:33.878
But they can be.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12928-0
01:06:33.948 --> 01:06:38.981
We can also go for a more
sophisticated methods, so a more

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12928-1
01:06:38.981 --> 01:06:40.858
sophisticated methods.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/12940-0
01:06:40.868 --> 01:06:43.558
So we are going to look at the
specific algorithms.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13011-0
01:06:43.628 --> 01:06:47.701
So this picture I'm I have
directly taken from the both the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13011-1
01:06:47.701 --> 01:06:51.638
authors have given similar
pictures so this one I think I

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13011-2
01:06:51.638 --> 01:06:55.914
had taken from the T4 they hands
slide so all we are saying is

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13011-3
01:06:55.914 --> 01:07:00.122
that we will talk about K means
much later after mid semester

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13011-4
01:07:00.122 --> 01:07:04.399
the algorithm but then we need
to understand that when we have

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13011-5
01:07:04.399 --> 01:07:05.688
the data like this.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13018-0
01:07:05.758 --> 01:07:07.858
Suppose this is the data we are
talking about.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13039-0
01:07:09.488 --> 01:07:13.398
And we need to do the binning or
we need to do a discretization.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13054-0
01:07:13.708 --> 01:07:19.354
So luckily for us, we got a data
which looks clearly meant for

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13054-1
01:07:19.354 --> 01:07:20.698
discretization.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13074-0
01:07:21.108 --> 01:07:25.114
So if we go for equal width
method so this is what we will

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13074-1
01:07:25.114 --> 01:07:25.928
end up with.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13083-0
01:07:26.828 --> 01:07:28.858
Then we go for equal depth
method.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13119-0
01:07:28.868 --> 01:07:33.512
We go for, we end up with this
because both of them have or are

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13119-1
01:07:33.512 --> 01:07:37.939
simple mathematical approaches
which which are not trying to

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13119-2
01:07:37.939 --> 01:07:39.898
look at the data by itself.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13145-0
01:07:40.368 --> 01:07:45.336
But then if we do a clustering,
clustering is a machine learning

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13145-1
01:07:45.336 --> 01:07:49.998
approach of distinguishing the
elements of data that we got.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13152-0
01:07:50.648 --> 01:07:53.848
Then we are expected to get
better results.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13171-0
01:07:57.718 --> 01:08:01.642
So now, now you may realize
something that the why the data

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13171-1
01:08:01.642 --> 01:08:03.538
science process is iterative.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13191-0
01:08:03.758 --> 01:08:07.212
So even for doing the
preprocessing, sometimes you

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13191-1
01:08:07.212 --> 01:08:09.988
need to use the data science
algorithms.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13245-0
01:08:10.318 --> 01:08:13.605
The essentially, when we say in
the data science process, when

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13245-1
01:08:13.605 --> 01:08:17.047
we looked at in the first class,
we said that, OK, we will do the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13245-2
01:08:17.047 --> 01:08:20.177
data processing, then we are
going to apply some algorithms

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13245-3
01:08:20.177 --> 01:08:22.368
and then we are going to get the
results.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13258-0
01:08:22.928 --> 01:08:27.019
But the preprocessing itself can
be a tricky process that may

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13258-1
01:08:27.019 --> 01:08:28.008
involve use of.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13268-0
01:08:29.938 --> 01:08:33.298
Several data science techniques,
including several algorithms.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13276-0
01:08:36.508 --> 01:08:38.098
OK, so that is the message.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13287-0
01:08:38.188 --> 01:08:40.988
OK, so now let us look at that
transformation.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13314-0
01:08:41.828 --> 01:08:45.826
Uh, OK, so maybe we should take
a small break or or there is

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13298-0
01:08:42.298 --> 01:08:43.118
So so.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13314-1
01:08:45.826 --> 01:08:47.398
some question coming up.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13311-0
01:08:48.378 --> 01:08:48.738
Yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13323-0
01:08:48.748 --> 01:08:50.998
So I had one question on this
last slide.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13328-0
01:08:52.068 --> 01:08:52.498
Hmm. Yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13349-0
01:08:52.338 --> 01:08:57.171
I I was trying to understand the
what are we trying to visualize

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13349-1
01:08:57.171 --> 01:09:01.408
in the width versus the depth
related graph that we had?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13357-0
01:09:01.418 --> 01:09:04.388
How the data is being
differently here?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13360-0
01:09:06.408 --> 01:09:06.678
What?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13377-0
01:09:06.728 --> 01:09:08.748
What's the relevance of binning
in each of that?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13381-0
01:09:09.748 --> 01:09:10.718
Or just one minute.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13385-0
01:09:10.728 --> 01:09:11.358
Just one minute.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13389-0
01:09:12.148 --> 01:09:13.758
Uh, we need to.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13391-0
01:09:13.888 --> 01:09:14.378
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13412-0
01:09:14.928 --> 01:09:18.587
So no, no, all I'm saying is
that you have got several data

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13412-1
01:09:18.587 --> 01:09:20.538
objects which have been plotted.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13431-0
01:09:20.948 --> 01:09:24.908
So there can be many, many times
you may end up getting millions

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13422-0
01:09:21.398 --> 01:09:21.748
Mm-hmm.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13431-1
01:09:24.908 --> 01:09:25.578
of records.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13452-0
01:09:25.588 --> 01:09:28.098
So first thing you may want to
do is to do some visualization.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13459-0
01:09:29.088 --> 01:09:29.268
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13483-0
01:09:29.148 --> 01:09:32.303
So in this case this is how it
looked like, because in this

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13483-1
01:09:32.303 --> 01:09:35.458
case you are actually lucky
because the data is showing up.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13526-0
01:09:35.468 --> 01:09:40.206
Clearly a trend whereby you can
do it, you can do a a separation

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13526-1
01:09:40.206 --> 01:09:44.506
into multiple groups, but in
that case you can see that if

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13514-0
01:09:43.078 --> 01:09:43.438
Hmm.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13526-2
01:09:44.506 --> 01:09:48.588
you use binning is becoming a
dumb method for doing it.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13539-0
01:09:48.928 --> 01:09:50.998
So you need a smarter method,
are you?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13541-0
01:09:49.448 --> 01:09:49.788
Mm-hmm.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13548-0
01:09:51.008 --> 01:09:51.538
Are we In Sync?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13546-0
01:09:52.488 --> 01:09:53.008
Yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13553-0
01:09:53.018 --> 01:09:55.128
So so how is so?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13575-0
01:09:55.138 --> 01:09:58.029
How is this a statement you know
holding through that K means

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13575-1
01:09:58.029 --> 01:09:59.708
clustering leads to better
results.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13583-0
01:10:00.678 --> 01:10:01.668
How are we saying it?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13592-0
01:10:01.678 --> 01:10:02.838
By looking at the graph here.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13631-0
01:10:03.668 --> 01:10:06.900
Known by because you you are
clearly see that none of the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13631-1
01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:10.243
groups of the items have been
disturbed because you can see

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13631-2
01:10:10.243 --> 01:10:13.864
that in second diagram the blue
group is disturbed and it is put

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13631-3
01:10:13.864 --> 01:10:14.978
into different bins.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13650-0
01:10:15.588 --> 01:10:18.998
Similarly, Red Group items got
distinguished and put into two

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13650-1
01:10:18.998 --> 01:10:21.418
distinct bins, which you don't
want, right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13698-0
01:10:23.128 --> 01:10:26.104
Because in this case none of
these items got disturbed, so

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13663-0
01:10:23.578 --> 01:10:24.348
Oh.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13674-0
01:10:24.538 --> 01:10:25.138
Ohh.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13690-0
01:10:25.148 --> 01:10:27.408
OK, OK OK, OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13698-1
01:10:26.104 --> 01:10:29.331
all of them which belong which
seem to be similar or staying in

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13698-2
01:10:29.331 --> 01:10:30.138
a similar group.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13694-0
01:10:30.708 --> 01:10:31.098
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13702-0
01:10:31.108 --> 01:10:32.698
OK, OK, I got it now.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13733-0
01:10:32.708 --> 01:10:36.710
I was not reading it correctly,
so zero to six is one of the bin

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13733-1
01:10:36.710 --> 01:10:39.418
6 to 10 is another and 10 to 16
is another.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13743-0
01:10:39.478 --> 01:10:41.928
Then and yeah, there's no.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13756-0
01:10:43.028 --> 01:10:46.178
Uh, yeah, this similar items are
falling into two different

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13756-1
01:10:46.178 --> 01:10:46.598
buckets.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13766-0
01:10:46.608 --> 01:10:48.508
Also, two different bills makes
sense, Sir.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13770-0
01:10:49.258 --> 01:10:49.908
Nightmares.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13775-0
01:10:49.468 --> 01:10:50.948
OK, OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13787-0
01:10:49.918 --> 01:10:51.768
Sorry that you know, I could not
understand.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13782-0
01:10:50.958 --> 01:10:51.258
All right.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13784-0
01:10:52.238 --> 01:10:52.658
Yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13805-0
01:10:52.668 --> 01:10:57.686
OK, so now what we do is that we
look at variable transformation

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13805-1
01:10:57.686 --> 01:11:00.388
and maybe maybe a break is
better.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13816-0
01:11:02.828 --> 01:11:03.248
Yes, Sir.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13819-0
01:11:03.908 --> 01:11:04.338
Yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13824-0
01:11:04.258 --> 01:11:04.998
Yes, Sir. Yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13825-0
01:11:04.348 --> 01:11:05.818
Let us take a 5 minute break.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13823-0
01:11:04.428 --> 01:11:04.528
Yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13840-0
01:11:10.638 --> 01:11:14.698
So I see some that this is slide
#4, right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13850-0
01:11:15.048 --> 01:11:16.708
Yeah, taking.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13868-0
01:11:16.608 --> 01:11:21.868
Ohh, this like Big 5 you're
talking about a slide deck 5R4.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13874-0
01:11:21.658 --> 01:11:23.138
Is for yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13877-0
01:11:22.578 --> 01:11:23.458
We are in slide deck.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13888-0
01:11:24.388 --> 01:11:26.038
Yeah, no.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13881-0
01:11:25.308 --> 01:11:25.738
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13889-0
01:11:25.748 --> 01:11:27.798
But here also I see the both the
same.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13919-0
01:11:29.738 --> 01:11:33.072
We need this is like the I I do
not know what is the question

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13906-0
01:11:29.798 --> 01:11:30.458
See here also.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13919-1
01:11:33.072 --> 01:11:33.878
you are asking.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13927-0
01:11:35.348 --> 01:11:38.768
Yeah, here that discretization
techniques.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13936-0
01:11:40.678 --> 01:11:41.698
Was that in the slide?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13957-0
01:11:44.888 --> 01:11:47.778
Both are in the both are in the
same same slides are.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13953-0
01:11:45.098 --> 01:11:45.758
No, no what?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13964-0
01:11:49.308 --> 01:11:50.438
No, no, no, no.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13978-0
01:11:49.628 --> 01:11:51.038
Slide four and five are same.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13986-0
01:11:50.448 --> 01:11:54.318
What I I do not know this is
this is something it is there.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/13997-0
01:11:54.328 --> 01:11:56.918
You are seeing that this slide
is present in two decks.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14002-0
01:11:56.928 --> 01:11:57.768
Is that what you're saying?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14036-0
01:11:59.748 --> 01:12:05.148
Define this slide is there in 4
the modules.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14031-0
01:12:04.378 --> 01:12:06.198
It's so in last class we talked
about it.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14039-0
01:12:06.208 --> 01:12:07.058
That is what you are saying.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14051-0
01:12:07.068 --> 01:12:08.728
We did not talk about it in the
last class.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14061-0
01:12:08.738 --> 01:12:10.728
The slide may be present, but we
did not talk right.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14073-0
01:12:12.728 --> 01:12:14.028
What do you present in the last
class?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14079-0
01:12:14.518 --> 01:12:15.078
Yeah. Yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14086-0
01:12:15.938 --> 01:12:17.748
So do you remember that we
talked about this?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14089-0
01:12:19.118 --> 01:12:19.708
No, no, Sir.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14095-0
01:12:19.718 --> 01:12:20.848
He he's saying that.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14107-0
01:12:21.478 --> 01:12:23.528
Are you the trying to slide #4?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14127-0
01:12:23.618 --> 01:12:26.563
I think you're doing the slide
#5 right, which is not yet

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14127-1
01:12:26.563 --> 01:12:27.528
uploaded to Carlos.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14129-0
01:12:28.418 --> 01:12:29.758
Yeah, right, right. Yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14144-0
01:12:33.068 --> 01:12:36.118
Why do you create more confusion
than that we already have?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14142-0
01:12:33.518 --> 01:12:33.778
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14150-0
01:12:38.968 --> 01:12:39.338
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14154-0
01:12:39.388 --> 01:12:40.608
So we can let's take break.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14195-0
01:14:03.608 --> 01:14:05.198
Hello Sir, I had a question.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14199-0
01:14:05.208 --> 01:14:05.908
Can I ask though?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14232-0
01:15:17.288 --> 01:15:18.748
OK, we can get restarted.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14234-0
01:15:20.758 --> 01:15:20.978
Right.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14250-0
01:15:24.668 --> 01:15:27.078
Hello Sir, I had a question
regarding quiz.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14277-0
01:15:27.088 --> 01:15:29.728
Can I ask it now or should I
wait for the end of the class?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14265-0
01:15:29.108 --> 01:15:29.398
Yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14267-0
01:15:29.408 --> 01:15:29.578
Yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14270-0
01:15:29.588 --> 01:15:29.908
Tell me.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14282-0
01:15:29.918 --> 01:15:31.098
Tell me what is the question?
Yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14351-0
01:15:31.588 --> 01:15:36.893
Ohh so Sarah, like what would be
the kind of questions that we'll

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14351-1
01:15:36.893 --> 01:15:41.635
be expecting like they will be
MCQ or OK and in so like in

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14312-0
01:15:38.978 --> 01:15:40.188
Yes, yes, that is correct.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14323-0
01:15:40.238 --> 01:15:41.468
That is correct, MCQS yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14351-2
01:15:41.635 --> 01:15:46.538
first few lectures I think a
couple of LECTURES we it it was

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14351-3
01:15:46.538 --> 01:15:48.628
mostly theoretical, right.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14437-0
01:15:48.738 --> 01:15:52.127
So the questions that we'll be
getting for quiz, they would be

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14437-1
01:15:52.127 --> 01:15:54.870
more like a computational
wearing will be you know

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14437-2
01:15:54.870 --> 01:15:58.151
computing something on the data
or would they be theoretical

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14437-3
01:15:58.151 --> 01:16:01.593
because you know, Sir, we have
not seen we we are not very sure

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14437-4
01:16:01.593 --> 01:16:05.089
how to prepare for the quiz and
this would be the ideas would be

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14430-0
01:16:05.058 --> 01:16:06.428
No, no, see.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14437-5
01:16:05.089 --> 01:16:07.348
the first quiz that you'll be
attempting.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14439-0
01:16:06.958 --> 01:16:08.188
No, no, just one minute.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14460-0
01:16:07.358 --> 01:16:10.978
So that yes, yes, yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14455-0
01:16:08.278 --> 01:16:11.628
Just one minute, Miss Pooja
misspeak.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14468-0
01:16:11.638 --> 01:16:13.488
Puja don't prepare for the quiz.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14507-0
01:16:13.778 --> 01:16:17.835
So what do you do is that you
learn the subject, so you just

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14507-1
01:16:17.835 --> 01:16:21.625
go through the contents,
textbooks, lectures, videos and

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14507-2
01:16:21.625 --> 01:16:25.748
slides, everything, learn it,
but don't prepare for the quiz.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14510-0
01:16:25.798 --> 01:16:26.188
Is that fine?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14524-0
01:16:28.488 --> 01:16:29.248
And she has it.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14556-0
01:16:30.008 --> 01:16:34.711
So can we have a list of topics
that we can expect and that was

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14528-0
01:16:30.058 --> 01:16:30.538
OK. Thank.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14556-1
01:16:34.711 --> 01:16:36.548
like what is the heading?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14578-0
01:16:35.488 --> 01:16:39.785
So, so so the idea is that the
quizzes to ensure that you are

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14578-1
01:16:39.785 --> 01:16:44.012
doing a continuous learning and
not waiting for the exams to

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14578-2
01:16:44.012 --> 01:16:44.358
come.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14580-0
01:16:45.468 --> 01:16:46.008
Does that help?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14601-0
01:16:53.538 --> 01:16:56.986
So just like a comprehensive
view of like what topics will be

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14601-1
01:16:56.986 --> 01:16:58.098
covered in the quiz.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14614-0
01:16:59.348 --> 01:17:02.878
See, the point is that the quiz
has only one purpose.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14650-0
01:17:02.888 --> 01:17:07.158
That is, to ensure that you are
constantly learning, so that is

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14650-1
01:17:07.158 --> 01:17:11.228
saying that that is saying that
as the things go, you review

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14650-2
01:17:11.228 --> 01:17:15.365
them and you learn them, you
explore them, don't wait for the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14650-3
01:17:15.365 --> 01:17:15.698
exam.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14656-0
01:17:16.128 --> 01:17:17.638
So nothing more.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14680-0
01:17:17.678 --> 01:17:22.357
So don't say that exam at the
syllabus this this topics and

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14680-1
01:17:22.357 --> 01:17:23.058
all that.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14684-0
01:17:23.868 --> 01:17:26.738
So obviously, obviously I we
hope it helps.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14683-0
01:17:25.128 --> 01:17:25.538
Said.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14688-0
01:17:26.888 --> 01:17:27.028
Yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14714-0
01:17:27.288 --> 01:17:30.328
So are we supposed to do some
computational Sir and?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14731-0
01:17:27.358 --> 01:17:37.438
Yes, Mr KAVIN NILAN, slide deck
15 and slide #59 ID, ID 4, PPTX.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14709-0
01:17:27.648 --> 01:17:29.178
And what is there set?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14734-0
01:17:38.558 --> 01:17:39.608
OK, OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14767-0
01:17:39.618 --> 01:17:45.705
I think that is fine because in
what we did is that you are

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14767-1
01:17:45.705 --> 01:17:52.198
possibly looking at slide deck
uploaded by the faculty of other

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14767-2
01:17:52.198 --> 01:17:52.908
others.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14795-0
01:17:52.998 --> 01:17:57.509
Because when I sent the slide
deck for ID S4, we obviously

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14795-1
01:17:57.509 --> 01:18:01.638
expected to cover more, but we
didn't cover that far.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14808-0
01:18:01.648 --> 01:18:04.348
So we had to put it into slide
deck file.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14815-0
01:18:05.058 --> 01:18:05.598
So.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14835-0
01:18:05.608 --> 01:18:09.635
So you look at your part of the
Section 1 and you look at what I

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14835-1
01:18:09.635 --> 01:18:10.998
upload in a Section 1.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14842-0
01:18:11.008 --> 01:18:12.468
So you will have lesser
confusion.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14881-0
01:18:17.278 --> 01:18:21.135
Sir, regarding the quizzes, you
know the the anxiety is also

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14881-1
01:18:21.135 --> 01:18:24.233
coming because we are
overwhelmed with four core

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14881-2
01:18:24.233 --> 01:18:27.268
subject and all are taking so
much of our time.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14908-0
01:18:27.698 --> 01:18:30.803
And so, you know, the preparing
for the quizzes is is not the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14908-1
01:18:30.803 --> 01:18:33.708
top of the mine now you know,
you know it will help that.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14921-0
01:18:33.718 --> 01:18:36.448
Yes, we do continuous learning
and then attempt the quiz.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14952-0
01:18:36.778 --> 01:18:40.395
But the scenario is not that
because of the overwhelming

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14952-1
01:18:40.395 --> 01:18:43.948
content that we all are
processing in such a short time

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14952-2
01:18:43.948 --> 01:18:44.138
so.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14948-0
01:18:44.028 --> 01:18:45.378
No, but then I see.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14965-0
01:18:45.388 --> 01:18:47.858
See what is the what is, what is
going to happen.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14981-0
01:18:47.868 --> 01:18:51.884
Again, they examinations will
also be again one after the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/14981-1
01:18:51.884 --> 01:18:53.268
other, is it not so?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15007-0
01:18:53.328 --> 01:18:55.884
So when the mid semester
examinations, you may have heard

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15007-1
01:18:55.884 --> 01:18:58.528
the schedule that they will
happen at the same time for all

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15007-2
01:18:58.528 --> 01:18:58.748
four.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15024-0
01:18:58.918 --> 01:19:02.316
It is not like ID S examination
will happen in January and

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15024-1
01:19:02.316 --> 01:19:03.928
another subject in February.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15035-0
01:19:04.318 --> 01:19:06.328
All of them will happen in the
over the weekend.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15039-0
01:19:06.378 --> 01:19:06.908
So.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15056-0
01:19:07.218 --> 01:19:13.108
So I'm not saying it's it's a
trivial task, but it it has an.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15064-0
01:19:13.178 --> 01:19:15.618
It's really we don't have any
escape clause there.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15075-0
01:19:19.148 --> 01:19:19.648
Yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15081-0
01:19:19.658 --> 01:19:23.348
And that is why we are
prioritizing the exam and only

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15081-1
01:19:23.348 --> 01:19:24.168
the content.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15090-0
01:19:24.178 --> 01:19:25.048
What is important?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15105-0
01:19:25.058 --> 01:19:27.438
So it would have.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15099-0
01:19:26.308 --> 01:19:28.098
Not I don't worry about that.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15133-0
01:19:28.148 --> 01:19:31.059
No, once you if you are in, if
you are In Sync with this

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15133-1
01:19:31.059 --> 01:19:33.918
subject, I know I think you will
do that should not be.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15138-0
01:19:37.638 --> 01:19:38.188
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15141-0
01:19:38.238 --> 01:19:39.898
So we will proceed further.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15170-0
01:19:46.188 --> 01:19:49.199
So we can do the transformation
of the data when it is a

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15170-1
01:19:49.199 --> 01:19:52.368
numerical data, we can think of
doing some transformations.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15177-0
01:19:52.708 --> 01:19:54.778
So what are those
transformations like?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15188-0
01:19:54.828 --> 01:19:56.458
Why do we do the transformation?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15197-0
01:19:56.468 --> 01:19:58.478
The transformations can be
mathematical.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15238-0
01:19:58.808 --> 01:20:02.710
So for example, we take the data
and then we raise it to the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15238-1
01:20:02.710 --> 01:20:06.868
power or we take a logarithm of
that we take exponent of that we

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15238-2
01:20:06.868 --> 01:20:10.898
do a query and we do many many
things that we can possibly do.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15259-0
01:20:11.328 --> 01:20:15.669
So the intent of doing that is
very often to do the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15259-1
01:20:15.669 --> 01:20:19.508
transformation that can lead to
some purpose.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15269-0
01:20:19.878 --> 01:20:22.518
So so there are many algorithms.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15275-0
01:20:22.658 --> 01:20:24.258
I hope we have it somewhere.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15314-0
01:20:24.308 --> 01:20:28.508
The algorithms where the data
transformation helps to solve

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15314-1
01:20:28.508 --> 01:20:33.058
and at this point we will not go
into those algorithms, but then

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15314-2
01:20:33.058 --> 01:20:37.328
the data transformation is a
requirement for for effectively

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15314-3
01:20:37.328 --> 01:20:39.428
working with those algorithms.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15325-0
01:20:39.858 --> 01:20:43.388
So we will, we will face them as
they come.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15335-0
01:20:43.568 --> 01:20:45.538
So you may perform the
transformation.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15365-0
01:20:45.548 --> 01:20:48.260
So this is not saying that
always you have to do that

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15365-1
01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:51.475
transformation and then there is
another reason why you perform

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15365-2
01:20:51.475 --> 01:20:52.228
transformation.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15385-0
01:20:52.238 --> 01:20:56.441
Sometimes when you perform these
operations, when you perform

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15385-1
01:20:56.441 --> 01:21:00.508
these operations, the data will
have a better distribution.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15404-0
01:21:00.518 --> 01:21:04.788
That is mathematically more
tractable than taking the normal

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15404-1
01:21:04.788 --> 01:21:07.658
values, so that can be the other
reason.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15407-0
01:21:12.008 --> 01:21:12.598
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15419-0
01:21:12.708 --> 01:21:16.558
And and we look at the
normalization.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15430-0
01:21:16.728 --> 01:21:19.558
So we already looked at one
method of normalization.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15460-0
01:21:19.908 --> 01:21:24.982
So when we talk about the
normalization, we want to reduce

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15460-1
01:21:24.982 --> 01:21:30.228
them into certain groups or
certain categories so that it is

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15460-2
01:21:30.228 --> 01:21:31.518
easy to manage.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15474-0
01:21:33.228 --> 01:21:37.408
So so it can be so we can look
at that.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15488-0
01:21:37.588 --> 01:21:41.638
So the one of the ways we do it
is through the scaling.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15516-0
01:21:42.598 --> 01:21:46.472
So the scaling is required
because when the features some

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15516-1
01:21:46.472 --> 01:21:50.679
features with bigger magnitude
dominate over the features with

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15516-2
01:21:50.679 --> 01:21:52.148
the smaller magnitude.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15523-0
01:21:52.158 --> 01:21:53.848
If we do not do it, OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15582-0
01:21:54.198 --> 01:21:58.834
And so it's a good idea that we
scale them to a similar scale

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15582-1
01:21:58.834 --> 01:22:03.544
and we also go for go for the
when we use the, when we use the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15582-2
01:22:03.544 --> 01:22:07.805
algorithms like gradient
descent, if many of you may not

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15582-3
01:22:07.805 --> 01:22:12.142
be knowing few people maybe
knowing in that case they may

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15582-4
01:22:12.142 --> 01:22:13.188
understand it.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15605-0
01:22:13.198 --> 01:22:16.126
But for those who don't
understand, this is one more

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15605-1
01:22:16.126 --> 01:22:19.551
algorithm which you are going to
study as part of the machine

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15605-2
01:22:19.551 --> 01:22:20.048
learning.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15617-0
01:22:20.548 --> 01:22:24.938
So this is to this is for
training a neural network.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15634-0
01:22:33.078 --> 01:22:37.580
So in such cases, when you have
done this scaling, that works

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15634-1
01:22:37.580 --> 01:22:38.088
better.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15656-0
01:22:41.248 --> 01:22:45.372
And similarly support vector
machine that also we may not be

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15656-1
01:22:45.372 --> 01:22:46.318
able to cover.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15668-0
01:22:46.688 --> 01:22:50.377
So that is an algorithm that is
that is helpful in doing a

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15668-1
01:22:50.377 --> 01:22:52.128
supervised machine learning.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15708-0
01:22:55.008 --> 01:22:59.246
So we had already looked at this
example data set so we can see

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15708-1
01:22:59.246 --> 01:23:02.954
that each one of these
attributes has different ranges,

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15708-2
01:23:02.954 --> 01:23:06.530
so scaling is going to give the
new importance to all

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15708-3
01:23:06.530 --> 01:23:07.258
attributes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15735-0
01:23:09.438 --> 01:23:15.198
And here is a list of algorithms
that require the scaling to be

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15730-0
01:23:15.128 --> 01:23:15.568
Background.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15735-1
01:23:15.198 --> 01:23:17.448
done to work efficiently.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15737-0
01:23:17.518 --> 01:23:19.428
I don't think tomato cup.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15746-0
01:23:22.458 --> 01:23:25.168
A lot of umm GAWARI.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15758-0
01:23:22.608 --> 01:23:27.157
Alright, so maybe I'm I'm seeing
some noise, so let me mute

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15758-1
01:23:27.157 --> 01:23:29.128
people for the time being.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15782-0
01:23:39.538 --> 01:23:44.411
OK, so now now let's look at
what are the methods for

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15782-1
01:23:44.411 --> 01:23:47.208
normalizing the numerical data.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15805-0
01:23:47.768 --> 01:23:52.144
So we can use min, Max
normalization or jet score

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15805-1
01:23:52.144 --> 01:23:56.608
normalization or normalization
by decimal scaling.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15810-0
01:23:57.378 --> 01:23:59.928
So decimal scaling is very
simple.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15819-0
01:24:00.218 --> 01:24:04.898
Suppose that we have people with
the income of.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15829-0
01:24:06.918 --> 01:24:09.388
So let me take again the income
examples.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15887-0
01:24:21.258 --> 01:24:25.320
So represent them as 1.5 two and
three, because you just include

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15887-1
01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:29.132
multiplied by 10 to the power of
minus six, and then this is

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15887-2
01:24:29.132 --> 01:24:32.819
becoming a decimal scaling
because you are rising, you are

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15887-3
01:24:32.819 --> 01:24:36.068
using a 10 to the power so it is
a decimal scaling.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15913-0
01:24:36.388 --> 01:24:41.021
So what you get will be 1.523,
so that can be one approach

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15913-1
01:24:41.021 --> 01:24:42.748
which is the last one.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15922-0
01:24:43.038 --> 01:24:46.398
And let us look at the other
approaches, other approaches.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15936-0
01:24:46.518 --> 01:24:49.318
First one we look at is min Max
scaling.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15964-0
01:24:49.918 --> 01:24:53.776
So in Min Max scaling what we
are doing is that we are trying

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15964-1
01:24:53.776 --> 01:24:57.198
to put they really attribute in
the range of 0 to one.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15982-0
01:24:57.588 --> 01:25:03.723
So suppose that we got some data
that is X, so we will use the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15982-1
01:25:03.723 --> 01:25:05.378
this app formula.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15994-0
01:25:09.398 --> 01:25:12.248
So that it is going into the new
minimum.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/15999-0
01:25:12.318 --> 01:25:13.128
So.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16016-0
01:25:13.198 --> 01:25:16.728
So in this case we have not used
because it is 0 new minimum is

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16016-1
01:25:16.728 --> 01:25:16.838
0.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16029-0
01:25:18.108 --> 01:25:23.048
So and then the new range is 1
and new minimum is 0.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16056-0
01:25:23.058 --> 01:25:26.858
So we need to did not use but
sometimes you may want to put

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16056-1
01:25:26.858 --> 01:25:29.328
the values in the range of five
to 10.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16066-0
01:25:29.898 --> 01:25:32.758
So in that case you may have to
do this for me.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16075-0
01:25:36.298 --> 01:25:38.028
So let's look at the examples.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16103-0
01:25:38.578 --> 01:25:43.469
So what we are saying is that we
have the income in the range of

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16103-1
01:25:43.469 --> 01:25:44.748
12,000 to 98,000.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16126-0
01:25:45.198 --> 01:25:49.641
So we want to put it into zero
to 1 range and so we want to get

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16126-1
01:25:49.641 --> 01:25:51.098
the value for 73,600.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16146-0
01:25:52.288 --> 01:25:57.519
So the way to convert it is that
when we convert we are getting a

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16146-1
01:25:57.519 --> 01:25:58.628
value of .716.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16152-0
01:26:04.168 --> 01:26:04.838
I hope it is clear.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16178-0
01:26:11.918 --> 01:26:16.517
Then let us look at The Jets
code normalization jets score

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16178-1
01:26:16.517 --> 01:26:20.648
normalization is that you get
the data big the mean.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16196-0
01:26:25.778 --> 01:26:30.279
And compute the standard
deviation and use The Jets

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16196-1
01:26:30.279 --> 01:26:30.798
score.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16207-0
01:26:32.688 --> 01:26:35.038
Is it dual to this for the data?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16225-0
01:26:35.048 --> 01:26:38.345
So for every X we are
subtracting the mean and

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16225-1
01:26:38.345 --> 01:26:40.098
dividing it by the Sigma.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16265-0
01:26:40.648 --> 01:26:46.856
So this way so previously we had
a normal distribution which was

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16265-1
01:26:46.856 --> 01:26:52.969
one by two by Sigma and then E
to the power of minus X minus MU

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16265-2
01:26:52.969 --> 01:26:55.738
divided by two Sigma squared.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16271-0
01:26:56.388 --> 01:26:58.038
This is becoming much simpler,
right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16278-0
01:27:00.328 --> 01:27:01.658
This is becoming much simpler.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16294-0
01:27:01.668 --> 01:27:05.298
So what we are saying is that X
minus MU by Sigma this.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16300-0
01:27:05.548 --> 01:27:07.518
So this is becoming jet.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16310-0
01:27:07.608 --> 01:27:10.088
So E to the power of minus Z
square.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16319-0
01:27:10.098 --> 01:27:11.318
That is what we are going to
get.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16328-0
01:27:11.808 --> 01:27:14.738
I hope that is the that is the
formula right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16350-0
01:27:59.388 --> 01:28:01.218
So this can be one approach.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16359-0
01:28:01.228 --> 01:28:03.418
For example, now we have the
same income.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16380-0
01:28:03.968 --> 01:28:13.056
So, so now we also know that the
standard deviation is 16 and

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16380-1
01:28:13.056 --> 01:28:14.668
mean is 54.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16392-0
01:28:14.978 --> 01:28:19.548
So we are going to get the jet
score using this approach.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16399-0
01:28:19.878 --> 01:28:21.308
So this will be the jet score.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16433-0
01:28:32.458 --> 01:28:36.246
And we can do the decimal
normalization, which is simple

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16433-1
01:28:36.246 --> 01:28:40.499
divide X by 10 to the power of
some scaling that you want to do

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16433-2
01:28:40.499 --> 01:28:42.958
whatever you consider is
reasonable.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16448-0
01:28:47.348 --> 01:28:50.518
So you can look at the examples
of decimal scaling.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16472-0
01:28:50.808 --> 01:28:56.067
So CGPA V change from 2 to .2
and the bonus we change it into

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16472-1
01:28:56.067 --> 01:28:57.678
a normalized bonus.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16536-0
01:28:58.188 --> 01:29:02.840
And then similarly, we can have
the normalization based on

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16536-1
01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:07.650
various scalings and then we
will look at the another aspect

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16536-2
01:29:07.650 --> 01:29:12.066
which is that how do we work
with categorical data when

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16536-3
01:29:12.066 --> 01:29:16.876
particularly when we are writing
the programs or when we are

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16536-4
01:29:16.876 --> 01:29:20.818
working with the the data for
sit and algorithms.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16555-0
01:29:21.168 --> 01:29:28.281
So we may want to represent that
by using an encoding, so the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16555-1
01:29:28.281 --> 01:29:29.658
encoding is.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16589-0
01:29:30.188 --> 01:29:34.435
There are two broad categories
of encoding that people work

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16589-1
01:29:34.435 --> 01:29:39.036
with, so one is 1 hot encoding,
1 hot encoding is saying that we

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16589-2
01:29:39.036 --> 01:29:42.008
are converting the categorical
attribute.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16596-0
01:29:42.018 --> 01:29:44.588
For example, we have categorical
attributes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16598-0
01:29:45.808 --> 01:29:46.648
Uh, gender.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16609-0
01:29:48.948 --> 01:29:50.818
And there is a male female.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16634-0
01:29:51.028 --> 01:29:57.634
So we are converting it into a
vector of size 2, so if it is

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16634-1
01:29:57.634 --> 01:30:02.398
mail, the values will be one and
then zero.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16638-0
01:30:02.868 --> 01:30:04.428
Then it is female.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16643-0
01:30:04.438 --> 01:30:06.938
This is zero and one.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16654-0
01:30:10.568 --> 01:30:13.478
So so this can be the in
approach.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16711-0
01:30:13.488 --> 01:30:18.583
So here The thing is that it is
simply converting it into a

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16711-1
01:30:18.583 --> 01:30:23.933
numerical value and that may be
used binary attribute for some

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16711-2
01:30:23.933 --> 01:30:28.433
purpose, but then it is
increasing the feature space

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16711-3
01:30:28.433 --> 01:30:33.358
because it is adding new
attributes and and then it is a.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16716-0
01:30:33.408 --> 01:30:34.878
It is a in that sense.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16746-0
01:30:34.888 --> 01:30:39.847
It has an overhead, so if we
look at suppose that there is a

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16746-1
01:30:39.847 --> 01:30:44.561
service quality that we are
talking about, there are five

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16746-2
01:30:44.561 --> 01:30:46.918
attributes 5 possible values.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16757-0
01:30:47.058 --> 01:30:51.908
So we replaced it with the five
five attributes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16778-0
01:30:57.768 --> 01:31:02.034
Each one can be represented by 1
bit, but now we are dealing with

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16778-1
01:31:02.034 --> 01:31:03.068
five attributes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16799-0
01:31:03.108 --> 01:31:07.039
So if we think that this is
going to help us in some way, we

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16799-1
01:31:07.039 --> 01:31:08.198
can, we may do it.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16826-0
01:31:08.668 --> 01:31:12.050
There is really the one hot
encoding is a popular technique,

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16826-1
01:31:12.050 --> 01:31:15.543
particularly people use it in
language processing because each

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16826-2
01:31:15.543 --> 01:31:16.818
word they represent it.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16859-0
01:31:16.968 --> 01:31:22.662
But then they realized that that
the better technique will be you

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16859-1
01:31:22.662 --> 01:31:27.838
create a proper embeddings which
are of much lower density.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16874-0
01:31:27.848 --> 01:31:30.840
Converting it into numbers, the
word has to be converted into

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16874-1
01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:31.178
number.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16901-0
01:31:31.248 --> 01:31:34.897
They they are choosing a
different type of vector rather

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16901-1
01:31:34.897 --> 01:31:38.802
than one hot, but then this one
hot as an output is always a

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16901-2
01:31:38.802 --> 01:31:39.378
feasible.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16923-0
01:31:39.508 --> 01:31:44.091
For example, you are trying to
get the some data and dividing

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16923-1
01:31:44.091 --> 01:31:47.638
it into and then predicting a
particular class.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16935-0
01:31:47.648 --> 01:31:50.308
Suppose that you want to predict
one among the five classes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16950-0
01:31:52.018 --> 01:31:57.968
Suppose that you have been given
some data and then some.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16975-0
01:31:57.978 --> 01:32:02.385
Let's say some words set of
words and you need to predict

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16975-1
01:32:02.385 --> 01:32:06.488
whether they are noun or verb or
adjective or adverb.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16996-0
01:32:07.538 --> 01:32:13.546
So so now now the point is that
so you can represent that using

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/16996-1
01:32:13.546 --> 01:32:15.048
one hot vectors.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17021-0
01:32:15.498 --> 01:32:20.854
So each one of them is going to
get a different bit set, so that

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17021-1
01:32:20.854 --> 01:32:24.808
is going to help in solving the
output problem.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17029-0
01:32:25.098 --> 01:32:27.558
But sometimes we may do it for
the input also.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17035-0
01:32:29.978 --> 01:32:30.628
So.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17050-0
01:32:30.688 --> 01:32:33.876
So in that case we are creating
the additional attributes and

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17050-1
01:32:33.876 --> 01:32:35.058
are setting the values.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17065-0
01:32:38.608 --> 01:32:42.375
And another approach, another
one that we frequently use is

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17065-1
01:32:42.375 --> 01:32:43.568
the label encoding.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17086-0
01:32:43.688 --> 01:32:47.633
So label encoding is a more
reasonable thing, so here we are

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17086-1
01:32:47.633 --> 01:32:49.638
not adding any extract tribute.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17095-0
01:32:49.648 --> 01:32:52.268
All we are saying is that
suppose there are colors.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17105-0
01:32:54.978 --> 01:32:59.168
Color can be green, blue, red.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17114-0
01:33:00.088 --> 01:33:03.808
So we are representing them 123
without meaning anything.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17141-0
01:33:11.098 --> 01:33:15.992
So so there is only one
variable, but then it uses some

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17141-1
01:33:15.992 --> 01:33:20.886
values rather than using the
text or the OR the nominal

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17141-2
01:33:20.886 --> 01:33:21.498
values.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17147-0
01:33:24.538 --> 01:33:24.968
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17151-0
01:33:25.018 --> 01:33:26.478
So are we.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17161-0
01:33:26.718 --> 01:33:28.468
I hope this is a very simple
concept.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17166-0
01:33:28.478 --> 01:33:29.778
I hope people are In Sync.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17191-0
01:33:31.368 --> 01:33:35.861
OK, so now what we do is that
let us take another example for

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17191-1
01:33:35.861 --> 01:33:40.208
proximity and possibly see
whether we are able to solve it.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17202-0
01:33:42.668 --> 01:33:44.928
So this is the problem
description.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17211-0
01:33:45.858 --> 01:33:48.408
So there are four data objects
again.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17226-0
01:33:48.558 --> 01:33:52.724
So we had already done it once
with the four data objects, but

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17226-1
01:33:52.724 --> 01:33:53.848
three attributes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17249-0
01:33:54.378 --> 01:33:57.648
So now let us do it with a
slightly different bigger

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17249-1
01:33:57.648 --> 01:34:00.918
problem where four data objects
and four attributes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17253-0
01:34:03.688 --> 01:34:04.498
So.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17268-0
01:34:04.548 --> 01:34:08.768
So what we know is that this is
this is a numeric, right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17277-0
01:34:15.658 --> 01:34:17.918
And these two are nominal.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17285-0
01:34:20.988 --> 01:34:22.268
And this is ordinal.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17293-0
01:34:28.878 --> 01:34:30.468
So how do we do that?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17306-0
01:34:30.478 --> 01:34:32.948
First, we need to do the
transformation of the data.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17339-0
01:34:33.358 --> 01:34:37.321
So what we are doing is we are
doing a min Max transformation

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17339-1
01:34:37.321 --> 01:34:41.348
for a numbers for the numeric
data into the range of 0 to one.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17358-0
01:34:41.718 --> 01:34:49.388
So what we are doing is that we
are doing the we are taking.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17360-0
01:34:49.518 --> 01:34:51.218
So 70,000 is becoming.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17367-0
01:34:54.488 --> 01:34:56.818
70,000 -, 50,000.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17378-0
01:34:58.768 --> 01:35:03.728
Divided by 80,000 -, 50,000.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17384-0
01:35:05.938 --> 01:35:06.898
Multiplied by.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17406-0
01:35:08.038 --> 01:35:13.180
Ohh this is zero to 1 range and
then multiplied by 1 + 0 so

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17406-1
01:35:13.180 --> 01:35:15.408
these things don't matter.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17423-0
01:35:15.538 --> 01:35:18.798
So what we are saying is that it
is becoming too by three, right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17432-0
01:35:19.338 --> 01:35:20.888
So this is .67.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17438-0
01:35:21.388 --> 01:35:23.008
Similarly, this one is 0.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17480-0
01:35:23.018 --> 01:35:28.250
This one is 1 and this one is .3
and so now what we do is that we

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17480-1
01:35:28.250 --> 01:35:33.243
directly compute the distances
and then we have to divide this

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17480-2
01:35:33.243 --> 01:35:36.968
by 4 because no the there are
four attributes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17522-0
01:35:36.978 --> 01:35:40.990
So we may want to put divide by
4 in order to get the distance

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17522-1
01:35:40.990 --> 01:35:44.938
value between 0 to one, but this
is sufficient for us to find

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17522-2
01:35:44.938 --> 01:35:48.759
what is The Who are the most
similar people and who are the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17522-3
01:35:48.759 --> 01:35:49.778
most dissimilar.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17533-0
01:36:10.988 --> 01:36:12.428
I hope we are In Sync.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17542-0
01:36:16.238 --> 01:36:18.838
Uh, anyone be having any further
questions?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17548-0
01:36:22.078 --> 01:36:22.968
Just give me.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17551-0
01:36:22.978 --> 01:36:23.768
Give me one minute.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17566-0
01:36:34.718 --> 01:36:37.318
I hope uh, let me enable the MIC
for all of you.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17584-0
01:37:05.388 --> 01:37:09.058
Browser the last question I'm
not able to understand.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17588-0
01:37:09.448 --> 01:37:10.248
Yeah this this.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17592-0
01:37:11.438 --> 01:37:12.208
OK, OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17603-0
01:37:12.218 --> 01:37:13.478
This light, right? Yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17605-0
01:37:13.438 --> 01:37:13.588
Yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17601-0
01:37:13.868 --> 01:37:14.658
Yeah, can.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17610-0
01:37:14.668 --> 01:37:15.888
Can you please explain this
letter?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17611-0
01:37:17.208 --> 01:37:17.638
No, no.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17613-0
01:37:17.648 --> 01:37:17.918
What?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17617-0
01:37:17.928 --> 01:37:18.458
What is that?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17644-0
01:37:18.468 --> 01:37:21.751
Maybe this is actually the same
problem we are doing second time

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17644-1
01:37:21.751 --> 01:37:24.478
because we have done one problem
with a simpler data.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17642-0
01:37:22.388 --> 01:37:22.688
Like.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17658-0
01:37:24.888 --> 01:37:28.158
Let we just enhance the data to
compute this.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17676-0
01:37:28.248 --> 01:37:33.349
So maybe maybe you can help me
understand where is the what is

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17676-1
01:37:33.349 --> 01:37:34.968
the real difficulty.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17685-0
01:37:36.818 --> 01:37:37.928
Now, how did we?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17689-0
01:37:37.268 --> 01:37:37.568
So.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17706-0
01:37:37.978 --> 01:37:41.368
How did we arrive at 0.69 for
RAM income?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17704-0
01:37:41.278 --> 01:37:41.828
Yes, yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17708-0
01:37:41.838 --> 01:37:43.248
0.67 for ram.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17720-0
01:37:43.258 --> 01:37:46.706
OK, this is using the min, Max,
normalization, min, Max

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17720-1
01:37:46.706 --> 01:37:47.568
normalization.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17738-0
01:37:47.578 --> 01:37:50.988
Let me go to the slide where we
did the min Max normalization

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17738-1
01:37:50.988 --> 01:37:51.428
formula.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17749-0
01:37:51.838 --> 01:37:54.258
So this is the formula that we
want to use.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17760-0
01:37:54.698 --> 01:37:56.908
So whatever is the value is
there.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17777-0
01:37:56.918 --> 01:38:00.850
We subtract from that the
minimum and then scale it by

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17777-1
01:38:00.850 --> 01:38:02.208
maximum to minimum.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17821-0
01:38:02.398 --> 01:38:06.263
That is the entire range, and if
the new Max minus new mean if

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17821-1
01:38:06.263 --> 01:38:10.250
the if the range is something we
want to put it in range of five

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17821-2
01:38:10.250 --> 01:38:12.458
to 10 or 6 to 10 that is
different.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17830-0
01:38:12.468 --> 01:38:14.238
But our intention is 0 to one.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17860-0
01:38:14.598 --> 01:38:18.309
So in this case, we don't need
to do anything because 1 -, 0 is

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17860-1
01:38:18.309 --> 01:38:21.962
1, so multiplying by 1 doesn't
make a difference, and new mini

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17860-2
01:38:21.962 --> 01:38:22.078
0.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17869-0
01:38:22.088 --> 01:38:23.898
So that also doesn't make a
difference.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17876-0
01:38:23.908 --> 01:38:25.718
So straight away this is the
approach.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17910-0
01:38:26.088 --> 01:38:31.063
So the same approach we have
used to compute the this value

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17910-1
01:38:31.063 --> 01:38:35.208
are we In Sync now or are there
some still Singh?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17902-0
01:38:34.278 --> 01:38:34.548
Uh.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17924-0
01:38:36.718 --> 01:38:37.818
The income is clear, right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17916-0
01:38:37.038 --> 01:38:37.668
So can you.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17927-0
01:38:37.678 --> 01:38:39.708
So can you show that slide, Sir?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17942-0
01:38:39.758 --> 01:38:40.658
Where you did.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17936-0
01:38:39.968 --> 01:38:41.058
No, no, just one minute.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17944-0
01:38:41.068 --> 01:38:42.378
Just one minute, Missouri.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17973-0
01:38:42.478 --> 01:38:46.444
Mr Saurabh is the income
calculation clear we are

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17965-0
01:38:45.828 --> 01:38:47.068
Yes, that is clear.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17973-1
01:38:46.444 --> 01:38:47.078
getting.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17981-0
01:38:47.078 --> 01:38:49.258
You have used the new Min Max
formula.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17991-0
01:38:48.198 --> 01:38:48.818
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17986-0
01:38:49.268 --> 01:38:49.958
That is clear.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17984-0
01:38:49.578 --> 01:38:50.048
Yes, yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18004-0
01:38:49.968 --> 01:38:50.998
Yeah, I understood this.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17994-0
01:38:50.058 --> 01:38:50.808
So that is clear.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/17996-0
01:38:50.818 --> 01:38:51.238
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18001-0
01:38:51.298 --> 01:38:51.838
OK, fine.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18019-0
01:38:51.848 --> 01:38:54.048
Now Miss Ruby, can you ask the
question please?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18014-0
01:38:54.098 --> 01:38:54.868
Uh, yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18033-0
01:38:54.878 --> 01:38:57.828
Just I want to see that Min, Max
one once please.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18037-0
01:38:57.778 --> 01:38:59.898
OK, Min, Max formula you want to
see again.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18039-0
01:38:59.968 --> 01:39:02.028
OK, OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18045-0
01:39:00.418 --> 01:39:01.238
Yeah, and.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18041-0
01:39:02.038 --> 01:39:02.288
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18046-0
01:39:02.298 --> 01:39:02.948
Yeah, yeah, fine.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18049-0
01:39:02.958 --> 01:39:03.248
Fine.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18053-0
01:39:03.298 --> 01:39:03.948
I'm going there.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18057-0
01:39:04.378 --> 01:39:04.728
Yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18061-0
01:39:04.898 --> 01:39:06.458
So this is the formula, yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18063-0
01:39:10.778 --> 01:39:11.108
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18066-0
01:39:13.138 --> 01:39:13.458
Alright.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18074-0
01:39:15.338 --> 01:39:17.658
So what values we are taking for
professions?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18080-0
01:39:19.718 --> 01:39:20.268
Profession.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18104-0
01:39:20.278 --> 01:39:23.631
We are taking it as a nominal
attribute, so we are looking at

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18104-1
01:39:23.631 --> 01:39:26.768
how many matches are there,
profession and also language.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18133-0
01:39:26.778 --> 01:39:29.357
We are taking them as nominal
attributes, so there are two

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18133-1
01:39:29.357 --> 01:39:31.891
nominal attributes and we are
seeing how many of them are

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18133-2
01:39:31.891 --> 01:39:33.508
matched and how many are
mismatched.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18163-0
01:39:34.148 --> 01:39:37.499
So when we look at the RAM and
Kishan, the profession is

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18163-1
01:39:37.499 --> 01:39:40.968
matched, but the language did
not match, so their distance

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18163-2
01:39:40.968 --> 01:39:41.908
will come as .5.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18186-0
01:39:43.458 --> 01:39:49.293
.5, which is a because the we
are we are not showing the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18186-1
01:39:49.293 --> 01:39:50.828
entire metrics.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18209-0
01:39:51.038 --> 01:39:56.775
So in case of RAM and fission,
uh, the value is coming at zero

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18209-1
01:39:56.775 --> 01:40:02.238
for profession Dr to doctor and
mother tongue is different.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18265-0
01:40:02.248 --> 01:40:05.170
So it is coming as one so that
when we scale it will it will

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18265-1
01:40:05.170 --> 01:40:08.283
come out as a different formula
but we are straight away putting

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18265-2
01:40:08.283 --> 01:40:11.300
each one for profession we are
putting in the distance at zero

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18265-3
01:40:11.300 --> 01:40:13.838
and for language we are putting
the distance as one.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18288-0
01:40:15.158 --> 01:40:18.388
But when we go for RAM and
BALRAM, the profession also has

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18288-1
01:40:18.388 --> 01:40:21.618
a distance of 1 and the language
also got a distance of 1.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18306-0
01:40:27.158 --> 01:40:32.048
Ohh but also this D ramble RAM
which is there.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18305-0
01:40:30.928 --> 01:40:31.778
Phone translate.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18307-0
01:40:33.038 --> 01:40:33.178
Yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18311-0
01:40:37.548 --> 01:40:38.108
Yes, go ahead.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18317-0
01:40:41.268 --> 01:40:43.268
OK, so D ramble.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18345-0
01:40:43.278 --> 01:40:49.143
Ram is there, there is 0.67 + 1
+ 1 + 2 -, 1 this calculation

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18345-1
01:40:49.143 --> 01:40:51.508
I'm not getting ram, ram.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18351-0
01:40:51.568 --> 01:40:52.258
OK, OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18366-0
01:40:51.568 --> 01:40:52.238
But sorry.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18357-0
01:40:52.268 --> 01:40:53.338
Yeah, yeah, sure, sure, sure.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18360-0
01:40:53.348 --> 01:40:53.868
Fine. Fine.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18362-0
01:40:53.908 --> 01:40:54.178
Yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18371-0
01:40:54.188 --> 01:40:56.178
OK, so how am I doing it?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18400-0
01:40:56.188 --> 01:41:00.625
It is very simple so I am doing
a first thing is that I am using

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18400-1
01:41:00.625 --> 01:41:04.378
OK OK maybe some some some
explanation I wrote to you.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18405-0
01:41:04.428 --> 01:41:06.458
OK, I'm using Manhattan
distance.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18415-0
01:41:11.738 --> 01:41:13.368
Which is combine all the
distance.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18439-0
01:41:13.378 --> 01:41:16.198
Simply add them up, because
sometimes you may go for an

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18439-1
01:41:16.198 --> 01:41:19.018
equally Euclidean approach for
combining the distances.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18472-0
01:41:19.028 --> 01:41:23.059
We I'm going for Manhattan
distance, so I'm adding up all

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18472-1
01:41:23.059 --> 01:41:26.880
the distances, so income
distance is .67 -, 0 so it is

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18472-2
01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:27.158
.67.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18480-0
01:41:27.208 --> 01:41:28.178
I hope that is clear.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18492-0
01:41:28.748 --> 01:41:33.343
The profession Dr to data
scientist distance is one

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18492-1
01:41:33.343 --> 01:41:34.138
language.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18504-0
01:41:34.398 --> 01:41:37.788
They are different, so distance
is 1 the native place.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18506-0
01:41:37.798 --> 01:41:38.588
This is ordinal.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18530-0
01:41:41.148 --> 01:41:47.016
So the distance is 2 -, 1, /, 4,
-, 1 which is the maximum

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18530-1
01:41:47.016 --> 01:41:48.408
values, right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18535-0
01:41:49.318 --> 01:41:50.098
So this is.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18537-0
01:41:50.938 --> 01:41:51.488
Does that help?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18543-0
01:41:55.228 --> 01:41:56.738
Yes, I understood.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18555-0
01:41:57.568 --> 01:41:58.228
Thank you, Rosa.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18549-0
01:41:57.698 --> 01:41:58.388
OK, OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18552-0
01:41:58.638 --> 01:41:58.968
Yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18561-0
01:41:58.978 --> 01:41:59.778
OK. So.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18562-0
01:41:59.318 --> 01:42:01.148
So, Sir, how this 4 -?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18574-0
01:42:01.158 --> 01:42:04.408
One came like 2 -, 1 like BALRAM
and Ram.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18589-0
01:42:04.418 --> 01:42:06.878
It is 2, -, 1, but the phone.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18581-0
01:42:06.008 --> 01:42:06.298
Yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18587-0
01:42:06.308 --> 01:42:07.028
Yeah, just just.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18590-0
01:42:08.168 --> 01:42:08.478
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18608-0
01:42:08.488 --> 01:42:12.266
OK, 4 -, 1 is the Mac because
this is an ordinal attribute

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18608-1
01:42:12.266 --> 01:42:13.418
ordinal attribute.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18631-0
01:42:13.428 --> 01:42:17.531
Actually we we in the past what
we did is we converted them into

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18631-1
01:42:17.531 --> 01:42:20.498
the values which by converting
into Jed score.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18654-0
01:42:20.848 --> 01:42:24.350
So but when we use the jet
score, this is now, let me let

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18654-1
01:42:24.350 --> 01:42:25.618
me use the jet score.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18666-0
01:42:25.628 --> 01:42:28.538
Then you will get the same
values but jet score is.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18671-0
01:42:28.548 --> 01:42:29.638
Suppose this is 1.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18676-0
01:42:29.648 --> 01:42:30.218
This is 2.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18682-0
01:42:30.228 --> 01:42:30.958
This is 3.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18686-0
01:42:31.348 --> 01:42:32.218
This is 4.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18716-0
01:42:32.278 --> 01:42:37.499
OK, so in that case, how do we
compute the jet score jet score

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18698-0
01:42:33.628 --> 01:42:33.908
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18716-1
01:42:37.499 --> 01:42:42.140
we compute by rank minus 1
divided by the maximum value

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18716-2
01:42:42.140 --> 01:42:42.968
minus one.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18718-0
01:42:43.298 --> 01:42:43.948
So.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18728-0
01:42:44.038 --> 01:42:45.748
So what is this for this one?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18747-0
01:42:45.758 --> 01:42:51.242
It will be 0 this one it will be
.33 because four is the maximum

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18747-1
01:42:51.242 --> 01:42:51.748
value.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18760-0
01:42:51.898 --> 01:42:54.648
So we have to use the 4 -, 1 to
scale.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18768-0
01:42:54.798 --> 01:42:56.648
So this will be .67.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18770-0
01:42:57.038 --> 01:42:57.778
This will be one.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18812-0
01:43:01.348 --> 01:43:05.275
So now using them we get the
same distance values, so you can

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18812-1
01:43:05.275 --> 01:43:09.328
see that the distance values are
coming from that same formula,

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18812-2
01:43:09.328 --> 01:43:13.255
but then expression is slightly
different, but it is the same

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18812-3
01:43:13.255 --> 01:43:13.508
for.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18851-0
01:43:23.138 --> 01:43:27.169
Instead of one question and
maybe maybe little stupid

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18827-0
01:43:24.828 --> 01:43:24.988
Yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18851-1
01:43:27.169 --> 01:43:31.647
question, but I still want to
ask and if you go back to the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18851-2
01:43:31.647 --> 01:43:32.468
slide, Sir.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18863-0
01:43:32.878 --> 01:43:36.028
So in the language, for example,
the mother tongue, right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18855-0
01:43:32.968 --> 01:43:33.108
Yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18869-0
01:43:36.178 --> 01:43:36.818
Yes, yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18890-0
01:43:36.378 --> 01:43:41.064
So I mean Ms, we are saying that
the distance is 11 and it's

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18890-1
01:43:41.064 --> 01:43:41.448
fine.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18902-0
01:43:41.518 --> 01:43:46.678
But consider scenario where and
Hindi and Butch Puri right.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18922-0
01:43:46.688 --> 01:43:50.404
There is a significant overlap
and if you want in the distance

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18921-0
01:43:49.098 --> 01:43:49.438
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18922-1
01:43:50.404 --> 01:43:51.348
is not truly 11.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18942-0
01:43:51.358 --> 01:43:52.618
So what do we do in such cases?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18943-0
01:43:51.718 --> 01:43:54.148
He absolutely, Mr Santosh,
absolutely right.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18945-0
01:43:54.158 --> 01:43:54.558
I'm.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18960-0
01:43:54.658 --> 01:43:56.760
I'm glad that you asked the
question and this is a very

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18960-1
01:43:56.760 --> 01:43:57.548
intelligent question.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19007-0
01:43:57.558 --> 01:44:02.982
Actually not stupid question and
and then the point is that the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/18974-0
01:44:00.038 --> 01:44:00.478
Thank you.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19007-1
01:44:02.982 --> 01:44:08.067
data scientist can do only so
much and now now the the call

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19007-2
01:44:08.067 --> 01:44:13.321
whether to include a scaling
there or merging there is really

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19007-3
01:44:13.321 --> 01:44:14.168
up to you.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19034-0
01:44:14.348 --> 01:44:17.701
So if you want to merge saying
that Hindi and Bajuri, you will

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19034-1
01:44:17.701 --> 01:44:20.308
give the same and you put them
as distance at 0.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19038-0
01:44:20.458 --> 01:44:21.758
So nothing stops.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19051-0
01:44:23.238 --> 01:44:25.248
Mr Amit, were you trying to ask
something?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19057-0
01:44:25.258 --> 01:44:27.458
I can see your mic showing up.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19062-0
01:44:29.568 --> 01:44:30.568
Mr Amit choudhary.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19067-0
01:44:32.338 --> 01:44:32.788
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19076-0
01:44:32.838 --> 01:44:34.728
Maybe maybe that was just a
disturbance.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19075-0
01:44:32.898 --> 01:44:33.328
Loser.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19086-0
01:44:34.858 --> 01:44:36.478
So Mr Santosh, you're fine,
right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19089-0
01:44:38.708 --> 01:44:39.058
Yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19096-0
01:44:39.068 --> 01:44:39.648
Yes, thank you.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19097-0
01:44:39.888 --> 01:44:40.888
OK, OK, alright.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19101-0
01:44:43.158 --> 01:44:43.788
So here.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19103-0
01:44:43.798 --> 01:44:44.088
How?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19112-0
01:44:44.158 --> 01:44:44.788
Why did we?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19147-0
01:44:44.918 --> 01:44:49.407
Did we define this as a ordinal
attribute and not others like

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19147-1
01:44:49.407 --> 01:44:51.578
the you only defined one as a.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19132-0
01:44:50.098 --> 01:44:50.748
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19158-0
01:44:50.758 --> 01:44:54.409
Just so that so that we can use
those formula, Mr Romik really,

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19158-1
01:44:54.409 --> 01:44:54.808
really.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19206-0
01:44:54.818 --> 01:44:58.295
If you say metropolitan and
cosmopolitan are same, no I I

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19206-1
01:44:58.295 --> 01:45:01.832
metropolitan and suburban are
same no it is possible there

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19206-2
01:45:01.832 --> 01:45:05.789
same no I don't want to get into
that ordinal so that it helps us

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19206-3
01:45:05.789 --> 01:45:06.988
to use that formula.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19208-0
01:45:06.998 --> 01:45:07.278
Nothing.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19231-0
01:45:08.508 --> 01:45:10.398
So we are saying rural art.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19225-0
01:45:09.278 --> 01:45:09.958
So is there any?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19258-0
01:45:11.068 --> 01:45:15.231
Is there any logics or which
attribute should be defined as a

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19251-0
01:45:14.958 --> 01:45:16.518
No, but look at this new.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19258-1
01:45:15.231 --> 01:45:16.238
ordinal versus?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19255-0
01:45:16.558 --> 01:45:17.328
No, no, no, no.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19262-0
01:45:17.338 --> 01:45:18.868
Look at this native place.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19275-0
01:45:19.438 --> 01:45:21.538
So does it not look like an
ordinal to you?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19274-0
01:45:19.758 --> 01:45:20.028
Hmm.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19288-0
01:45:24.318 --> 01:45:26.268
I'm OK maybe that helps me.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19300-0
01:45:26.378 --> 01:45:28.428
Mr Do you think that?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19331-0
01:45:27.548 --> 01:45:30.785
So if we can talk about same
thing for the mother tongue

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19331-1
01:45:30.785 --> 01:45:34.078
also, right, that could also be
the order our profession.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19319-0
01:45:33.218 --> 01:45:34.208
Umm how?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19339-0
01:45:34.218 --> 01:45:36.581
How the how are you going to
create an ordinal variable out

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19339-1
01:45:36.581 --> 01:45:37.408
of the mother tongue?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19344-0
01:45:37.418 --> 01:45:38.228
How do you create that?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19354-0
01:45:43.428 --> 01:45:45.288
Because you need to give me a
ranking, right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19365-0
01:45:47.188 --> 01:45:47.468
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19362-0
01:45:47.348 --> 01:45:48.658
So that is right.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19395-0
01:45:48.668 --> 01:45:51.836
So if you think that there is
some the distance between the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19395-1
01:45:51.836 --> 01:45:55.110
languages like Mr Santosh has
said, so the last two languages

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19395-2
01:45:55.110 --> 01:45:56.218
are a lot of overlap.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19407-0
01:45:56.228 --> 01:45:58.798
So I want to convert them into
the same language.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19410-0
01:45:58.808 --> 01:45:59.318
That is fine.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19412-0
01:45:59.848 --> 01:46:00.528
Nothing stops.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19433-0
01:46:02.958 --> 01:46:07.698
Alright, OK, I hope I hope yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19426-0
01:46:05.558 --> 01:46:06.378
Said one more question.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19427-0
01:46:05.978 --> 01:46:06.518
I said.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19438-0
01:46:08.398 --> 01:46:10.638
I said what is from your
perspective?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19453-0
01:46:10.648 --> 01:46:12.998
What exactly the ordinal is
you're referring to?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19464-0
01:46:13.528 --> 01:46:13.948
Can you get?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19467-0
01:46:13.858 --> 01:46:15.648
No ordinary is when there is a
ranking.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19475-0
01:46:15.658 --> 01:46:17.738
Like, suppose you have a.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19490-0
01:46:17.798 --> 01:46:20.908
You have a grade ABCD so that is
ordinal.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19506-0
01:46:20.918 --> 01:46:24.326
So similarly, your company has a
designation, assistant manager,

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19506-1
01:46:24.326 --> 01:46:26.528
manager, senior manager, general
manager.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19520-0
01:46:26.538 --> 01:46:27.288
So they are audience.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19524-0
01:46:27.368 --> 01:46:27.718
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19536-0
01:46:27.558 --> 01:46:29.378
Mr Dish RATHNA, is that true?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19557-0
01:46:28.168 --> 01:46:31.365
So kind of the primary kind of
thing you are referring to,

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19557-1
01:46:31.365 --> 01:46:33.858
right, Sir, in in a database
normal database.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19561-0
01:46:33.918 --> 01:46:36.188
No language ordinal is difficult
to define.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19570-0
01:46:36.238 --> 01:46:37.688
No, I I do not know your
question.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19576-0
01:46:37.698 --> 01:46:38.988
I do not understand your
question.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19603-0
01:46:38.998 --> 01:46:41.349
Are you looking for some
knowledge or do you want to help

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19590-0
01:46:39.698 --> 01:46:40.088
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19616-0
01:46:40.098 --> 01:46:44.619
So no, I just wanted to refer
what exactly ordinal you are

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19603-1
01:46:41.349 --> 01:46:42.078
me with something?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19616-1
01:46:44.619 --> 01:46:45.998
referring to, Sir.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19621-0
01:46:45.468 --> 01:46:46.198
What email?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19618-0
01:46:46.128 --> 01:46:47.678
So that. Yes, Sir.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19625-0
01:46:47.688 --> 01:46:48.228
Yes, Sir. Please.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19638-0
01:46:49.598 --> 01:46:51.778
Is it understood now or it is
not understood?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19670-0
01:46:53.258 --> 01:46:57.574
So what I understood is like if
you want to I you uniquely

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19670-1
01:46:57.574 --> 01:47:01.816
identify any row in a in a
system so that row we can that

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19670-2
01:47:01.816 --> 01:47:02.328
column.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19704-0
01:47:02.338 --> 01:47:06.363
Basically, we can consider it as
ordinal wherein it is a kind of

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19704-1
01:47:06.363 --> 01:47:08.468
ranking or some designation
that.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19692-0
01:47:06.808 --> 01:47:07.578
Yes, yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19717-0
01:47:07.688 --> 01:47:10.488
So the importance is the ranking
if the ranking is present, you

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19717-1
01:47:10.488 --> 01:47:11.888
can call it as ordinance, right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19721-0
01:47:12.958 --> 01:47:13.848
OK, OK, Sir.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19725-0
01:47:14.058 --> 01:47:14.228
It.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19729-0
01:47:14.278 --> 01:47:14.718
Thank you, Sir.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19730-0
01:47:15.688 --> 01:47:15.828
Yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19737-0
01:47:17.408 --> 01:47:17.868
Come here.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19746-0
01:47:17.878 --> 01:47:21.098
Considering the native place
this order first.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19756-0
01:47:22.578 --> 01:47:24.068
Are you asking me something,
miss NANDINI?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19764-0
01:47:25.608 --> 01:47:27.478
It's I mean not audible.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19768-0
01:47:28.958 --> 01:47:30.068
No, you're not audible.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19773-0
01:47:30.078 --> 01:47:30.768
You have to be louder.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19776-0
01:47:32.838 --> 01:47:33.508
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19801-0
01:47:33.558 --> 01:47:36.734
No, I'm asking like we are
considering native places out in

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19801-1
01:47:36.734 --> 01:47:39.168
a lateral glute in this example,
right, like.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19810-0
01:47:41.258 --> 01:47:41.788
Yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19816-0
01:47:41.568 --> 01:47:42.338
So how come?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19830-0
01:47:41.858 --> 01:47:44.863
So you you don't like that
example, considering the native

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19830-1
01:47:44.863 --> 01:47:45.728
place as ordinal?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19828-0
01:47:46.418 --> 01:47:47.028
No, no, no.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19853-0
01:47:47.038 --> 01:47:50.471
Make it doesn't, it does not
define any rank or any category

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19853-1
01:47:50.471 --> 01:47:50.808
right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19863-0
01:47:50.818 --> 01:47:51.558
Like it is just.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19850-0
01:47:50.908 --> 01:47:51.198
No.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19856-0
01:47:51.208 --> 01:47:51.838
Is it not?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19860-0
01:47:51.848 --> 01:47:52.218
See.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19873-0
01:47:52.228 --> 01:47:55.298
See the point is the point I
wanted to make is like this.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19894-0
01:47:55.388 --> 01:47:59.041
It is really I'm talking about
the size of the place and now

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19894-1
01:47:59.041 --> 01:48:00.778
the village is a small place.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19903-0
01:48:00.788 --> 01:48:02.518
Small town is a little bigger
place.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19913-0
01:48:02.528 --> 01:48:04.358
Suburban is a even bigger place.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19948-0
01:48:04.368 --> 01:48:08.323
Metropolitan is even bigger and
and I'm happy that because this

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19948-1
01:48:08.323 --> 01:48:12.092
example I have been, I have my
may have used it with already

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19948-2
01:48:12.092 --> 01:48:13.698
some 6 or 8 or 10 batches.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19982-0
01:48:14.188 --> 01:48:17.840
So I'm happy that you asked, so
I have no problem because I

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19982-1
01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:21.552
thought that sometimes you may
say that when you are talking

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/19982-2
01:48:21.552 --> 01:48:23.378
about a culture of the people.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20007-0
01:48:23.888 --> 01:48:28.098
So you may think that a village
person is closer to a person

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20016-0
01:48:24.438 --> 01:48:24.718
Thank you.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20007-1
01:48:28.098 --> 01:48:31.618
with a small town rather than to
a big city or so.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20012-0
01:48:31.628 --> 01:48:33.118
But then so.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20022-0
01:48:33.168 --> 01:48:35.638
But then, if you think that
doesn't work, yeah, I'm.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20029-0
01:48:35.648 --> 01:48:37.148
I'm open to listening to you.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20034-0
01:48:40.288 --> 01:48:40.668
No, Sir.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20037-0
01:48:40.678 --> 01:48:41.648
Got it. Yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20075-0
01:48:44.738 --> 01:48:48.439
No, but then I appreciate the
point that I think you are the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20075-1
01:48:48.439 --> 01:48:52.261
first one, possibly this example
we have been using for we may

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20075-2
01:48:52.261 --> 01:48:54.748
have used it already with 10,000
people.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20080-0
01:48:54.758 --> 01:48:55.748
But you have asked it.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20082-0
01:48:55.758 --> 01:48:56.118
That's good.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20106-0
01:49:01.318 --> 01:49:05.920
Said I I have a question about
the the binary translation that

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20106-1
01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:08.038
the slide very we're talking.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20113-0
01:49:08.088 --> 01:49:09.918
I did not understand the
significance of that.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20123-0
01:49:11.538 --> 01:49:13.738
Binary is what binary is.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20135-0
01:49:13.748 --> 01:49:16.870
Just saying that into two
categories, putting it into two

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20135-1
01:49:16.870 --> 01:49:17.838
categories, right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20158-0
01:49:18.228 --> 01:49:20.263
Like the way we can have three
categories, we can have two

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20158-1
01:49:20.263 --> 01:49:21.608
categories that becomes binary,
right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20160-0
01:49:22.218 --> 01:49:23.168
No, no, no, no, no.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20176-0
01:49:23.218 --> 01:49:26.254
There was one slide where we
were converting characters into

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20176-1
01:49:26.254 --> 01:49:27.398
the bit representation.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20203-0
01:49:28.898 --> 01:49:33.481
Ohh wookie OK all we are saying
is that we are putting it into

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20203-1
01:49:33.481 --> 01:49:35.008
putting it into 0001.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20235-0
01:49:35.018 --> 01:49:39.337
So that can be useful in many
times in the programming when

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20235-1
01:49:39.337 --> 01:49:44.016
you represent that way, and that
may also be more efficient with

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20235-2
01:49:44.016 --> 01:49:44.808
respect to.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20247-0
01:49:44.818 --> 01:49:47.408
Sometimes it is more efficient,
but sometimes it can cause.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20264-0
01:49:47.418 --> 01:49:51.892
You may make you because you are
creating many attributes, so all

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20264-1
01:49:51.892 --> 01:49:53.248
we are saying is so.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20277-0
01:49:53.358 --> 01:49:56.995
So suppose that now we had
languages like Hindi, Bhojpuri,

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20277-1
01:49:56.995 --> 01:49:57.488
Bengali.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20303-0
01:49:57.818 --> 01:50:02.393
So instead of putting them as
long as it is, you put them at

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20303-1
01:50:02.393 --> 01:50:03.668
001010100, right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20310-0
01:50:03.878 --> 01:50:05.128
You put the one at different
places.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20333-0
01:50:06.888 --> 01:50:09.850
I mean, are we looking at it
from this space and memory

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20333-1
01:50:09.850 --> 01:50:11.278
optimization point of view?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20364-0
01:50:11.288 --> 01:50:15.701
Because the character would take
longer, whereas representing it

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20359-0
01:50:14.388 --> 01:50:16.898
No, no, no, this is, let me put
it this way.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20364-1
01:50:15.701 --> 01:50:16.448
into no no.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20385-0
01:50:16.908 --> 01:50:19.874
This is this is what data
scientists have been using for a

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20385-1
01:50:19.874 --> 01:50:22.588
long time as A1 hot encoding in
programming language.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20408-0
01:50:23.318 --> 01:50:27.197
So put them in categorical
attribute that way and so so

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20408-1
01:50:27.197 --> 01:50:31.283
there are many algorithms that
they found is that they run

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20408-2
01:50:31.283 --> 01:50:31.768
better.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20428-0
01:50:31.778 --> 01:50:35.480
So it's nothing to really giving
no giving no additional

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20428-1
01:50:35.480 --> 01:50:37.818
information or no additional
logic.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20466-0
01:50:40.668 --> 01:50:43.873
So you will hear many times in
programming or someplace people

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20442-0
01:50:40.838 --> 01:50:41.138
You are.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20444-0
01:50:41.378 --> 01:50:41.678
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20466-1
01:50:43.873 --> 01:50:47.078
saying that I have done one hot
encoding, so don't be worried.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20473-0
01:50:47.148 --> 01:50:48.818
All they did is to put the
binaries.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20477-0
01:50:52.608 --> 01:50:53.198
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20492-0
01:50:53.278 --> 01:50:53.738
Thank you.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20511-0
01:50:53.748 --> 01:50:57.870
I ideally if you're constrained
with the, I mean it a lot of

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20511-1
01:50:57.870 --> 01:51:01.248
data we would avoid using one
hot encoding right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20529-0
01:51:02.438 --> 01:51:03.848
Because they are attributes will
increase.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20532-0
01:51:03.248 --> 01:51:05.558
30 If no, no, it is not a lot of
data.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20547-0
01:51:05.568 --> 01:51:09.878
But suppose that if it is 3
attributes, so 010 is fine.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20552-0
01:51:10.228 --> 01:51:11.408
But what will happen?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20572-0
01:51:11.478 --> 01:51:15.277
Is suppose you have got a
something which can have take

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20572-1
01:51:15.277 --> 01:51:17.448
possibly 50,000 possible values.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20577-0
01:51:17.458 --> 01:51:19.418
So that vector becomes very big.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20584-0
01:51:19.428 --> 01:51:19.808
Is it not?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20587-0
01:51:20.358 --> 01:51:21.708
Yes, right.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20624-0
01:51:22.558 --> 01:51:26.139
I mean the second approach was
better than I think where you

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20624-1
01:51:26.139 --> 01:51:29.955
said, you know assign one value
to each like 1234 something like

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20618-0
01:51:29.218 --> 01:51:29.848
Right, right.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20621-0
01:51:29.858 --> 01:51:30.398
Yeah, right.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20624-2
01:51:29.955 --> 01:51:30.248
that.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20625-0
01:51:31.138 --> 01:51:31.858
Right, right. Yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20642-0
01:51:34.368 --> 01:51:37.938
Alright, so now let us proceed
into the feature engineering.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20663-0
01:51:38.308 --> 01:51:41.443
So feature engineering is not a
big it's a sounds like a big

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20663-1
01:51:41.443 --> 01:51:43.498
name, but it is not really a big
thing.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20699-0
01:51:43.508 --> 01:51:48.197
So all we are saying is that
when would be we have the data,

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20699-1
01:51:48.197 --> 01:51:53.193
we have the data when applied to
the model, we rather call it as

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20699-2
01:51:53.193 --> 01:51:54.038
a features.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20719-0
01:51:54.048 --> 01:51:58.408
That is how most of the data
scientists and most of the most

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20719-1
01:51:58.408 --> 01:52:00.338
of the books refer to them.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20723-0
01:52:00.828 --> 01:52:01.618
So.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20732-0
01:52:01.668 --> 01:52:06.438
So The thing is that there is
the feature is what?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20735-0
01:52:09.058 --> 01:52:09.548
What?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20753-0
01:52:09.588 --> 01:52:13.708
Uh, we give it to the model for
the purpose of the modeling.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20766-0
01:52:13.718 --> 01:52:17.798
We give it to the program, so
don't really worry about this.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20773-0
01:52:17.808 --> 01:52:19.428
This is more of a nomenclature.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20810-0
01:52:19.438 --> 01:52:23.060
It is same as an attribute, but
some people say that attribute

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20810-1
01:52:23.060 --> 01:52:26.566
that is given to the model I
would call it as a feature, but

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20810-2
01:52:26.566 --> 01:52:27.888
don't worry about that.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20847-0
01:52:27.898 --> 01:52:30.582
So feature engineering by
feature engineering we are

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20847-1
01:52:30.582 --> 01:52:33.621
saying is that what do we do
when we have too many features

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20847-2
01:52:33.621 --> 01:52:36.761
or too few features or if we
think that the feature has to be

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20847-3
01:52:36.761 --> 01:52:37.368
transformed.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20857-0
01:52:37.738 --> 01:52:41.248
So we need to we need to
consider a few things.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20879-0
01:52:41.258 --> 01:52:46.451
First thing is that when we have
many features we we we have to

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20879-1
01:52:46.451 --> 01:52:51.238
recognize that the data science
algorithms generally fail.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20922-0
01:52:51.968 --> 01:52:56.085
They fail for very simple reason
that the many some of those

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20922-1
01:52:56.085 --> 01:53:00.134
features will be having random
values and with those random

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20922-2
01:53:00.134 --> 01:53:04.589
values they are going to confuse
the machine when it is computing

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20922-3
01:53:04.589 --> 01:53:06.478
the distance and similarity.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20927-0
01:53:06.528 --> 01:53:07.368
Are we In Sync there?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20933-0
01:53:08.158 --> 01:53:10.948
Then we introduce irrelevant
values.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20942-0
01:53:11.098 --> 01:53:14.048
For example, we are talking
about got.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20967-0
01:53:14.778 --> 01:53:19.711
Suppose you need to sell in a a
fancy gadget and you are looking

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20967-1
01:53:19.711 --> 01:53:23.808
for the customers who are likely
to buy your product.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20983-0
01:53:24.778 --> 01:53:27.885
So you also got the set of
customers who have got who

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/20983-1
01:53:27.885 --> 01:53:28.978
bought the product.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21026-0
01:53:29.238 --> 01:53:34.342
So now let us say only relevant
attribute is income, but instead

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21026-1
01:53:34.342 --> 01:53:39.053
of stopping with income, you
thought that even the even the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21026-2
01:53:39.053 --> 01:53:43.685
age counts, the profession
counts and then the ZIP code of

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21026-3
01:53:43.685 --> 01:53:45.098
the person counts.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21066-0
01:53:45.678 --> 01:53:50.514
So now in the process you have
created many attributes and now

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21066-1
01:53:50.514 --> 01:53:55.349
you start computing the distance
between the various customers

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21066-2
01:53:55.349 --> 01:54:00.031
and see who is likely to buy
based on the people who already

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21066-3
01:54:00.031 --> 01:54:00.568
bought.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21078-0
01:54:01.338 --> 01:54:04.648
So you are going to get more
erroneous results.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21095-0
01:54:04.718 --> 01:54:09.025
Are we In Sync by introducing
irrelevant attributes and using

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21095-1
01:54:09.025 --> 01:54:11.108
them for distance calculation?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21105-0
01:54:11.378 --> 01:54:14.817
Is going to create more
confusion rather than helping

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21105-1
01:54:14.817 --> 01:54:15.008
us.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21134-0
01:54:17.038 --> 01:54:19.983
I'm saying straight away saying
that they are irrelevant

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21134-1
01:54:19.983 --> 01:54:22.875
attributes, but they are
available so so, so many times

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21134-2
01:54:22.875 --> 01:54:23.908
you have a data set.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21157-0
01:54:24.198 --> 01:54:28.265
The data sets will contain 200
attributes, but you are problem

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21157-1
01:54:28.265 --> 01:54:30.588
may require really only 20 of
them.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21188-0
01:54:30.978 --> 01:54:35.623
So if you don't take the trouble
of filtering those 180, it is

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21188-1
01:54:35.623 --> 01:54:40.342
likely that your algorithm will
be misled and give inconsistent

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21188-2
01:54:40.342 --> 01:54:42.038
or inefficient results.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21203-0
01:54:42.978 --> 01:54:47.920
So so that is referred as a
phenomenon known as hugest

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21203-1
01:54:47.920 --> 01:54:48.908
phenomenon.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21235-0
01:54:48.918 --> 01:54:53.062
This is also considered as a
curse of dimensionality by some

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21235-1
01:54:53.062 --> 01:54:56.527
people, so when they
dimensionality increases, the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21235-2
01:54:56.527 --> 01:55:00.738
quality of results from the data
science process will reduce.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21245-0
01:55:06.858 --> 01:55:10.068
OK, so having understood that
let us proceed.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21252-0
01:55:10.248 --> 01:55:12.298
How do we handle that
redundancy?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21292-0
01:55:12.658 --> 01:55:16.867
So one of the ways we can handle
the redundancy is that so be me

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21292-1
01:55:16.867 --> 01:55:20.817
get redundancy because we get
data from many sources or even

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21292-2
01:55:20.817 --> 01:55:24.831
when it is from one source that
may have integrated data from

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21292-3
01:55:24.831 --> 01:55:25.608
many places.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21302-0
01:55:25.938 --> 01:55:28.598
So we need to identify what is
derivable data.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21351-0
01:55:31.048 --> 01:55:34.607
If the data is derivable, we
should not use it straight away

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21351-1
01:55:34.607 --> 01:55:38.165
and use it into the algorithm,
because the the the this data

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21351-2
01:55:38.165 --> 01:55:41.723
can already be computed using
the other attributes, so it is

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21351-3
01:55:41.723 --> 01:55:43.298
not going to add any value.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21367-0
01:55:44.248 --> 01:55:44.958
So.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21371-0
01:55:45.008 --> 01:55:48.678
So the other approach to find
the redundant attributes through

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21371-1
01:55:48.678 --> 01:55:51.358
correlation analysis and
covariance analysis.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21378-0
01:55:51.368 --> 01:55:52.468
So we are going to look at that.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21402-0
01:55:53.588 --> 01:56:00.335
So the correlation analysis is
when we have and numerical data,

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21402-1
01:56:00.335 --> 01:56:07.082
we can compute the correlation
coefficient witches witches also

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21402-2
01:56:07.082 --> 01:56:07.398
so.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21421-0
01:56:10.478 --> 01:56:15.508
Referred as a person's movement,
so the formula is this.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21441-0
01:56:15.678 --> 01:56:21.305
So we have the attributes one
column which is AI, another

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21441-1
01:56:21.305 --> 01:56:23.148
column which is BI.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21455-0
01:56:23.588 --> 01:56:26.608
So we want to see whether there
is a correlation between them.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21483-0
01:56:26.778 --> 01:56:31.077
So we compute the mean for both
the columns and apply this

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21483-1
01:56:31.077 --> 01:56:35.448
formula and this will give us
the results in the range of 1

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21483-2
01:56:35.448 --> 01:56:36.468
and minus one.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21515-0
01:56:38.608 --> 01:56:44.733
OK, this will be the range and
when it is 1 they are positively

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21515-1
01:56:44.733 --> 01:56:50.093
correlated strongly positively
correlated and this is a

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21515-2
01:56:50.093 --> 01:56:52.198
negatively correlated.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21522-0
01:56:52.208 --> 01:56:54.778
So when one increases, other
decreases.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21539-0
01:57:02.708 --> 01:57:07.658
So the correlation can also be
computed using a dot product.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21577-0
01:57:07.788 --> 01:57:12.108
So to do that you need to use
these two, so you'd have to

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21577-1
01:57:12.108 --> 01:57:16.652
compute the jet score of A and
jet score of B, and then do a

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21577-2
01:57:16.652 --> 01:57:17.918
dot product then.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21583-0
01:57:17.928 --> 01:57:19.248
Also you will get the
correlation.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21606-0
01:57:21.558 --> 01:57:26.475
Another closely related concept
to correlation is a covariance

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21606-1
01:57:26.475 --> 01:57:29.128
in covariance in the
denominator.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21609-0
01:57:26.658 --> 01:57:28.438
No browser.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21621-0
01:57:29.138 --> 01:57:32.428
You will not use the Sigma and
Sigma.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21627-0
01:57:31.558 --> 01:57:33.238
And also also.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21630-0
01:57:32.598 --> 01:57:34.058
OK, so there is a question.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21647-0
01:57:34.338 --> 01:57:35.858
Yeah and.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21640-0
01:57:35.648 --> 01:57:36.648
Just a sort of here.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21649-0
01:57:36.688 --> 01:57:38.738
I just one confirmation in the
previous slide.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21653-0
01:57:39.558 --> 01:57:39.708
Yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21668-0
01:57:40.938 --> 01:57:43.108
There is a dot product which you
mentioned is.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21688-0
01:57:42.058 --> 01:57:45.758
Previous previous slide is this
slide right, yes, yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21676-0
01:57:43.178 --> 01:57:44.468
Yeah, yeah, 40 point.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21680-0
01:57:44.478 --> 01:57:45.008
Yes, yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21701-0
01:57:45.378 --> 01:57:48.158
So dot product means what we are
mentioning right now here.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21711-0
01:57:48.518 --> 01:57:51.408
The dot predict we talked about
the cosine similarity.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21720-0
01:57:51.418 --> 01:57:53.058
First, we compute A dot product.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21728-0
01:57:51.858 --> 01:57:53.898
OK. Umm.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21733-0
01:57:53.118 --> 01:57:57.918
So now let us say, let us say
the vector a, right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21743-0
01:57:57.928 --> 01:57:59.198
So let me let me put it.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21755-0
01:57:59.268 --> 01:58:03.633
So let me put it vector A I'm
representing it, let's say small

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21755-1
01:58:03.633 --> 01:58:04.118
vector.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21811-0
01:58:04.168 --> 01:58:14.327
OK, so it is a A1A2A3 and vector
B is B1B2B3 and A dot BE is

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21811-1
01:58:14.327 --> 01:58:25.319
simply A1 dot B1A1 multiplied by
B1 plus a 2 * B two plus a 3 * B

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21811-2
01:58:25.319 --> 01:58:26.318
three.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21815-0
01:58:26.788 --> 01:58:28.098
That will be the dot product.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21830-0
01:58:30.878 --> 01:58:32.828
So we have seen that for cosine,
right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21834-0
01:58:32.878 --> 01:58:33.688
The numerator.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21836-0
01:58:33.148 --> 01:58:35.078
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21844-0
01:58:34.358 --> 01:58:35.718
Yeah, yeah. OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21864-0
01:58:35.288 --> 01:58:44.660
So rauser this this one just now
the in the slide E key there is

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21857-0
01:58:41.018 --> 01:58:41.398
Hmm.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21864-1
01:58:44.660 --> 01:58:44.948
a.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21867-0
01:58:44.988 --> 01:58:45.638
Yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21892-0
01:58:45.728 --> 01:58:50.295
So AKI is nothing but a K minus
mean by standard deviation A

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21892-1
01:58:50.295 --> 01:58:53.738
which we were calculating the Z
score. Right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21904-0
01:58:54.168 --> 01:58:56.918
Z score we calculated and then
another Z score.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21898-0
01:58:54.248 --> 01:58:54.728
Right, right.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21936-0
01:58:56.928 --> 01:59:01.826
We are calculating, so can I
understand that it's nothing but

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21936-1
01:59:01.826 --> 01:59:06.723
multiplication of two different
Z score and which is going to

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21933-0
01:59:05.218 --> 01:59:05.948
Yeah, that is correct.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21936-2
01:59:06.723 --> 01:59:07.118
yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21952-0
01:59:06.868 --> 01:59:07.428
That is correct.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21941-0
01:59:07.128 --> 01:59:08.058
So which will give?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21945-0
01:59:08.068 --> 01:59:08.418
Yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21947-0
01:59:08.468 --> 01:59:08.768
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21950-0
01:59:08.778 --> 01:59:09.178
Got it.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21967-0
01:59:09.008 --> 01:59:11.841
Yeah, actually, actually, Mr
Saurav, you can look at the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21961-0
01:59:09.188 --> 01:59:09.608
Yes. OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21967-1
01:59:11.841 --> 01:59:12.238
formula.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21980-0
01:59:12.348 --> 01:59:14.838
So in the formula actually it is
already there.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21999-0
01:59:15.128 --> 01:59:19.278
So so it is just that we can
express that as a dot product.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/21991-0
01:59:15.978 --> 01:59:16.198
Yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22013-0
01:59:19.328 --> 01:59:21.718
Yeah, so, so this is this may
be, yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22012-0
01:59:19.688 --> 01:59:20.928
Yeah, got it. Yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22042-0
01:59:25.088 --> 01:59:27.783
And we can have like a
correlation, we have a

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22042-1
01:59:27.783 --> 01:59:31.532
covariance, so covariance only
advantage with the covariance is

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22042-2
01:59:31.532 --> 01:59:33.348
that it is easier to calculate.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22057-0
01:59:33.358 --> 01:59:36.731
You don't need to calculate the
Sigma only you need to calculate

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22057-1
01:59:36.731 --> 01:59:37.198
the mean.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22077-0
01:59:37.618 --> 01:59:41.165
So because Sigma involves the
squares and square roots, so

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22077-1
01:59:41.165 --> 01:59:43.028
this will be faster to compute.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22093-0
01:59:44.758 --> 01:59:47.623
So, but then the covariance can
only give the sign of the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22093-1
01:59:47.623 --> 01:59:47.968
change.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22101-0
01:59:48.178 --> 01:59:50.028
It is not going to give you the
magnitude.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22122-0
01:59:50.038 --> 01:59:53.933
Magnitude is not important, so
cosine covariance is going to

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22122-1
01:59:53.933 --> 01:59:55.848
tell whether they're going to.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22181-0
01:59:55.858 --> 02:00:00.005
They have a positive relation or
negative relation, so you can

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22181-1
02:00:00.005 --> 02:00:03.889
see that we have got the two
stocks and we have looking at

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22181-2
02:00:03.889 --> 02:00:07.838
the stock prices over one week,
so Monday to Friday we have

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22181-3
02:00:07.838 --> 02:00:12.051
taken the stock prices for two
stocks A&amp;B and we are seeing

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22181-4
02:00:12.051 --> 02:00:15.474
whether they have a positive
covariance or negative

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22181-5
02:00:15.474 --> 02:00:16.198
covariance.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22193-0
02:00:16.328 --> 02:00:18.858
So we are seeing that they have
a positive covariance.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22213-0
02:00:18.868 --> 02:00:23.214
So what that means is that we
can predict that if a rises, the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22213-1
02:00:23.214 --> 02:00:24.938
B is also likely to rise.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22216-0
02:00:29.508 --> 02:00:29.958
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22239-0
02:00:30.488 --> 02:00:34.659
And then then we have another
concept, which is that for

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22239-1
02:00:34.659 --> 02:00:38.098
nominal data it is called Chi
square analysis.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22253-0
02:00:39.198 --> 02:00:43.288
Uh, so the chi squared analysis
is something.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22267-0
02:00:43.338 --> 02:00:46.528
Have you studied the chi squared
analysis already in your MFDS?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22278-0
02:00:48.728 --> 02:00:51.028
No, not OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22276-0
02:00:48.888 --> 02:00:49.388
Ohh no.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22282-0
02:00:49.608 --> 02:00:49.908
No, no.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22280-0
02:00:51.038 --> 02:00:51.188
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22287-0
02:00:51.198 --> 02:00:51.838
OK, no problem.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22289-0
02:00:51.848 --> 02:00:52.448
No problem.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22310-0
02:00:52.648 --> 02:00:57.022
So what we do is that in Chi
Square this is for computing the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22310-1
02:00:57.022 --> 02:00:57.868
correlation.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22328-0
02:00:57.918 --> 02:01:02.366
For nominal data, this is for
computing the correlation for

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22328-1
02:01:02.366 --> 02:01:03.848
nominal data, right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22347-0
02:01:04.668 --> 02:01:08.921
So how do we compute so we
compute a cross tabulation

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22347-1
02:01:08.921 --> 02:01:10.968
between the two variables?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22369-0
02:01:11.368 --> 02:01:14.496
Suppose that we have two
attributes, so one is 1

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22369-1
02:01:14.496 --> 02:01:17.878
attribute is the person like
science fiction or not.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22379-0
02:01:17.928 --> 02:01:20.978
So for each person we have
surveyed 1500 people.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22386-0
02:01:24.708 --> 02:01:24.978
Uh.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22388-0
02:01:24.728 --> 02:01:25.898
1500 people.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22400-0
02:01:26.508 --> 02:01:29.878
And then what we did is that we
asked for two attributes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22404-0
02:01:30.268 --> 02:01:31.198
Do you play chess?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22414-0
02:01:33.278 --> 02:01:34.658
So this is yes or no.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22422-0
02:01:35.508 --> 02:01:38.808
And then, like science fiction,
this is your son.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22456-0
02:01:39.538 --> 02:01:44.023
So we computed after we get the
data from the survey of for 1500

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22456-1
02:01:44.023 --> 02:01:47.749
people, we have formulated the
cross tabulation cross

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22456-2
02:01:47.749 --> 02:01:48.508
tabulation.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22494-0
02:01:48.518 --> 02:01:52.275
There are 450 people, like
science fiction or and out of

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22494-1
02:01:52.275 --> 02:01:56.494
them 250 play chess and 200 do
not, and 1050 people do not like

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22494-2
02:01:56.494 --> 02:01:57.548
science fiction.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22506-0
02:01:57.558 --> 02:02:00.508
Out of them, 50 people play
chess and 1000 people do not.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22531-0
02:02:00.938 --> 02:02:04.159
So now the question is that do
we think that there is a

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22531-1
02:02:04.159 --> 02:02:07.208
correlation between playing
chess and liking science

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22531-2
02:02:07.208 --> 02:02:07.668
fiction?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22557-0
02:02:08.238 --> 02:02:11.981
So when we have this type of
nominal attributes, we are

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22557-1
02:02:11.981 --> 02:02:15.858
looking at the number of
possible values that the nominal

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22557-2
02:02:15.858 --> 02:02:17.128
attribute can take.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22567-0
02:02:17.638 --> 02:02:20.788
So there is a concept called
degrees of freedom.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22581-0
02:02:21.338 --> 02:02:25.928
So this is count of rows minus 1
multiplied by columns minus one.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22587-0
02:02:26.058 --> 02:02:27.308
So why is that?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22593-0
02:02:27.578 --> 02:02:28.588
Why is it like this?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22597-0
02:02:28.898 --> 02:02:30.148
So, so.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22612-0
02:02:30.198 --> 02:02:34.644
So let me let me compute so to
explain the rows, explain the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22612-1
02:02:34.644 --> 02:02:36.028
degrees of freedom.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22621-0
02:02:37.918 --> 02:02:40.308
So let us say we have the data.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22626-0
02:02:43.248 --> 02:02:44.768
Which is like this.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22679-0
02:02:50.348 --> 02:02:57.151
So so one is play and not play
right and then like and not like

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22679-1
02:02:57.151 --> 02:03:03.848
so we can we have the summary
four, 50,050 we have already got

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22679-2
02:03:03.848 --> 02:03:07.568
the summary and then 300 and
1200.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22691-0
02:03:08.508 --> 02:03:12.338
So we don't have the core cross
relation between the two.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22701-0
02:03:12.448 --> 02:03:14.618
We do not have the relation
between the two.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22719-0
02:03:14.888 --> 02:03:19.516
We only got this summation of
both the data, so now let us say

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22719-1
02:03:19.516 --> 02:03:20.838
I put this as 250.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22730-0
02:03:22.748 --> 02:03:24.818
So I put one of the values.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22738-0
02:03:25.088 --> 02:03:27.578
So now look at the other three
values.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22748-0
02:03:27.588 --> 02:03:29.168
Do you really need other three
values?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22753-0
02:03:30.888 --> 02:03:32.538
Other three values you can
derive right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22759-0
02:03:34.708 --> 02:03:35.958
One value is given.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22779-0
02:03:35.968 --> 02:03:39.748
You can derive other three
values, so there is only one

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22779-1
02:03:39.748 --> 02:03:42.718
independent value in the
correlation table.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22783-0
02:03:42.868 --> 02:03:43.518
Is that clear?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22794-0
02:03:44.268 --> 02:03:47.188
So that is why the degrees of
freedom is coming to one.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22800-0
02:03:49.178 --> 02:03:50.208
Uh, big.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22806-0
02:03:50.218 --> 02:03:51.768
Explain one second.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22811-0
02:03:51.938 --> 02:03:54.128
Again, Sir, this one.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22814-0
02:03:54.008 --> 02:03:54.668
I OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22823-0
02:03:55.408 --> 02:03:58.058
Uh, yes, Miss Surubi, what is
the question?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22839-0
02:03:58.108 --> 02:03:59.088
I didn't get your question.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22843-0
02:03:58.668 --> 02:04:01.198
Yeah, please explain the A
degree of freedom.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22869-0
02:04:01.208 --> 02:04:04.836
Once again, please so with
whatever example you have given

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22862-0
02:04:02.818 --> 02:04:05.448
But no, no, no, no.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22869-1
02:04:04.836 --> 02:04:05.328
alright.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22867-0
02:04:05.458 --> 02:04:05.588
It.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22890-0
02:04:05.598 --> 02:04:09.987
Have you understood that once
251 of the one of these four

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22890-1
02:04:09.987 --> 02:04:13.408
values, so one of these four
values is given?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22898-0
02:04:13.998 --> 02:04:16.808
So suppose that this is already
given.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22917-0
02:04:17.118 --> 02:04:19.900
This is these things are already
given because they are

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22917-1
02:04:19.900 --> 02:04:21.738
independent of the other
attributes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22921-0
02:04:20.998 --> 02:04:21.408
Umm.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22926-0
02:04:21.778 --> 02:04:24.328
So we these are only
representing one particular

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22926-1
02:04:24.328 --> 02:04:24.848
attribute.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22941-0
02:04:25.238 --> 02:04:28.978
So now let me look at let me
share these four.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22977-0
02:04:25.738 --> 02:04:26.378
Umm.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22958-0
02:04:30.698 --> 02:04:35.131
I am shading the four attributes
with purple out of these four

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22958-1
02:04:35.131 --> 02:04:36.608
attributes, 4 values.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22971-0
02:04:36.658 --> 02:04:39.395
I am saying that if one is
given, you can get the other

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22971-1
02:04:39.395 --> 02:04:39.688
three.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22994-0
02:04:40.138 --> 02:04:43.493
Can you just convince yourself
that when one is given, you can

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23002-0
02:04:41.828 --> 02:04:45.368
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/22994-1
02:04:43.493 --> 02:04:44.558
get the other right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23012-0
02:04:45.548 --> 02:04:48.240
OK, that is all you need to do
so that is the degrees of

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23012-1
02:04:48.240 --> 02:04:48.618
freedom.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23020-0
02:04:48.628 --> 02:04:50.598
So the degrees of freedom in
this case is 1.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23044-0
02:04:52.928 --> 02:04:57.871
So we are going to what we are
going to compute is that now we

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23044-1
02:04:57.871 --> 02:05:00.538
will compute the observed
values.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23058-0
02:05:00.548 --> 02:05:03.503
These are the observed values,
so these are the observed

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23058-1
02:05:03.503 --> 02:05:04.228
values, right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23086-0
02:05:08.908 --> 02:05:12.881
No, what we say is that first
letter assume that there is

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23086-1
02:05:12.881 --> 02:05:16.785
absolutely no correlation
between liking science fiction

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23086-2
02:05:16.785 --> 02:05:18.018
and playing chess.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23094-0
02:05:18.348 --> 02:05:20.258
So then what are we expecting?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23101-0
02:05:20.268 --> 02:05:22.698
So these are two independent
random variables.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23143-0
02:05:23.018 --> 02:05:27.803
So when there are 450 people who
like science fiction, So what do

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23143-1
02:05:27.803 --> 02:05:32.371
we expect in the relation of the
playing chess and not because

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23143-2
02:05:32.371 --> 02:05:36.358
20% people play chess and 80%
people don't play chess?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23168-0
02:05:36.588 --> 02:05:42.838
So you expect that 20% of 450 is
90 and 80% of the 4:50 is 360.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23206-0
02:05:42.848 --> 02:05:47.108
So you expect 90 people should
play just and 360 people should

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23206-1
02:05:47.108 --> 02:05:50.961
not play just similarly, 1050
people do not like science

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23206-2
02:05:50.961 --> 02:05:53.598
fiction, so 20% is 210 and 80%
is 840.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23221-0
02:05:53.908 --> 02:06:01.888
So the within brackets we have
expected expected assuming.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23224-0
02:06:04.268 --> 02:06:05.588
No correlation.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23233-0
02:06:08.118 --> 02:06:11.088
So these two are completely
independent attributes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23258-0
02:06:11.188 --> 02:06:14.950
So now we compute the chi
square, which is a comparison of

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23258-1
02:06:14.950 --> 02:06:17.628
observed values with the
expected values.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23269-0
02:06:17.978 --> 02:06:20.218
So we are getting a chi square
score.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23286-0
02:06:20.958 --> 02:06:27.323
So this guy Square score will
help us decide whether there is

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23286-1
02:06:27.323 --> 02:06:27.528
a.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23324-0
02:06:27.758 --> 02:06:33.150
So, given the degrees of freedom
one BS, look at only the first

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23324-1
02:06:33.150 --> 02:06:38.457
row and what we say is that if
the chi square value is greater

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23324-2
02:06:38.457 --> 02:06:43.258
than this is this is the
probability of null hypothesis.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23330-0
02:06:45.568 --> 02:06:48.448
Null hypothesis in disguise.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23335-0
02:06:48.458 --> 02:06:50.738
Square analysis is no
correlation.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23351-0
02:06:53.838 --> 02:06:58.246
So we are getting the null
hypothesis chi square value

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23351-1
02:06:58.246 --> 02:06:59.528
greater than 10.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23393-0
02:06:59.828 --> 02:07:05.114
So what we are saying is that
the null hypothesis has a

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23393-1
02:07:05.114 --> 02:07:10.966
strength less than .01, so that
is we can say with 99 greater

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23393-2
02:07:10.966 --> 02:07:15.308
than 99% confidence that they
are correlated.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23396-0
02:07:15.898 --> 02:07:16.468
Are we In Sync?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23413-0
02:07:24.218 --> 02:07:25.278
Said from where?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23411-0
02:07:24.378 --> 02:07:24.798
Arvin.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23419-0
02:07:24.568 --> 02:07:25.828
Sir, can you can you repeat?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23416-0
02:07:25.878 --> 02:07:26.258
Uh.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23428-0
02:07:26.678 --> 02:07:29.428
Is that from where we are
deriving that expected value?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23447-0
02:07:30.708 --> 02:07:33.936
Expected value we have computed
assuming there is no

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23447-1
02:07:33.936 --> 02:07:36.738
correlation, so they have to
follow the same.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23486-0
02:07:37.188 --> 02:07:42.276
So what we are saying is that
see see the the people who are

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23486-1
02:07:42.276 --> 02:07:47.697
play chess and not play chess in
a typical population is 20% and

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23486-2
02:07:47.697 --> 02:07:49.448
80%, right, Missouri.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23499-0
02:07:49.458 --> 02:07:50.358
You observed that right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23502-0
02:07:51.368 --> 02:07:52.768
No, but how did we arrive at
that?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23507-0
02:07:51.758 --> 02:07:52.218
Uh, yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23519-0
02:07:53.048 --> 02:07:55.588
How how did we arrive at that 20
percent, 80% Sir.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23537-0
02:07:56.138 --> 02:07:59.534
Because we are thinking we we
think that this population is a

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23537-1
02:07:59.534 --> 02:08:02.820
representative population for
playing chess and not playing

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23537-2
02:08:02.820 --> 02:08:03.148
chess.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23550-0
02:08:05.278 --> 02:08:06.008
Ohio, OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23560-0
02:08:06.168 --> 02:08:10.308
So 1500 people out of them 300
places for 1200 don't play.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23577-0
02:08:10.478 --> 02:08:14.408
So we think that 20% people play
just and 2080% don't.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23576-0
02:08:13.228 --> 02:08:13.948
OK, OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23580-0
02:08:17.918 --> 02:08:18.278
Alright.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23598-0
02:08:20.718 --> 02:08:21.248
Mr B.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23592-0
02:08:20.828 --> 02:08:22.258
So out of four. Yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23606-0
02:08:21.258 --> 02:08:23.588
Admin Singh, OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23596-0
02:08:22.268 --> 02:08:22.678
Yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23640-0
02:08:22.758 --> 02:08:28.548
So out of four out of out of
450, we are keeping like that

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23640-1
02:08:28.548 --> 02:08:33.258
20% like 90 in pages and 360 not
playing chess.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23645-0
02:08:33.728 --> 02:08:35.658
Yes, yes, that is the expected
values.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23652-0
02:08:34.768 --> 02:08:36.138
OK hmm.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23659-0
02:08:35.668 --> 02:08:38.894
Assuming that there is no
relation, there is no dependence

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23659-1
02:08:38.894 --> 02:08:39.878
between these two.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23682-0
02:08:40.168 --> 02:08:43.279
So what we assume is that we
will follow a standard

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23682-1
02:08:43.279 --> 02:08:46.628
distribution like any other like
the for playing chess.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23694-0
02:08:46.638 --> 02:08:49.098
We have the already the standard
values 2018.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23716-0
02:08:49.448 --> 02:08:53.301
So which is which is, which is a
which we call it as a pop

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23716-1
02:08:53.301 --> 02:08:56.108
probability that we computed
from outside.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23725-0
02:08:56.968 --> 02:08:59.098
Uh, so that we assume that it
holds.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23727-0
02:09:00.668 --> 02:09:01.158
Hmm.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23729-0
02:09:01.248 --> 02:09:01.638
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23736-0
02:09:01.648 --> 02:09:02.048
Thank you, Sir.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23739-0
02:09:02.858 --> 02:09:04.168
So can you explain this?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23754-0
02:09:04.178 --> 02:09:08.028
How do we derive this number
92110 three 6840?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23769-0
02:09:09.328 --> 02:09:13.828
OK, 90 and 360 just now we
talked.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23774-0
02:09:13.878 --> 02:09:15.238
So is that still a problem?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23779-0
02:09:14.428 --> 02:09:14.568
Yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23800-0
02:09:15.248 --> 02:09:18.848
19 So what we are saying is
first thing, let us assume that

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23800-1
02:09:18.848 --> 02:09:21.068
this is a representative
population.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23810-0
02:09:21.128 --> 02:09:24.088
So 1500 is good enough to for
you to draw conclusions.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23829-0
02:09:24.158 --> 02:09:27.168
OK, so now you see the 300
people play.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23824-0
02:09:25.158 --> 02:09:25.438
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23849-0
02:09:27.178 --> 02:09:30.388
Just 1200 people don't play just
so you can assume that

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23849-1
02:09:30.388 --> 02:09:32.508
probability of playing chess is
20%.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23857-0
02:09:32.558 --> 02:09:33.708
Is that fine, Mr Romik?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23867-0
02:09:33.938 --> 02:09:35.888
Correct, right.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23875-0
02:09:35.548 --> 02:09:38.888
So now use the same thing to the
population which likes the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23875-1
02:09:38.888 --> 02:09:39.778
science fiction.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23887-0
02:09:40.248 --> 02:09:42.938
So there are 450 people who like
science fiction.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23903-0
02:09:43.188 --> 02:09:46.032
They should follow the same
distribution like 20% should

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23903-1
02:09:46.032 --> 02:09:47.628
play cricket, play chess, right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23914-0
02:09:50.488 --> 02:09:52.548
So 90 people should play just
among the 4:50.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23945-0
02:09:56.488 --> 02:10:00.000
Because because we are saying
that there is no impact of the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23940-0
02:09:56.608 --> 02:09:58.298
Can you please go back to the
slide, Sir?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23945-1
02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:00.978
one on the other.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23957-0
02:10:01.348 --> 02:10:03.838
So it will follow the same
population distribution.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23963-0
02:10:04.648 --> 02:10:05.988
Is that fine, Mr Romik?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23966-0
02:10:07.878 --> 02:10:08.208
Yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23976-0
02:10:08.218 --> 02:10:09.488
Can you go back to slide please,
Sir?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23977-0
02:10:10.288 --> 02:10:10.688
Yes, yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23989-0
02:10:18.438 --> 02:10:20.558
So 250 -, 90 is.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/23992-0
02:10:21.698 --> 02:10:22.648
No, no, don't worry.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24000-0
02:10:22.658 --> 02:10:24.248
Don't worry about 250 -, 90.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24030-0
02:10:24.258 --> 02:10:28.099
First, convince yourself that
the numbers within brackets, so

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24030-1
02:10:28.099 --> 02:10:32.063
you are convinced that with the
if there is no relation between

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24030-2
02:10:32.063 --> 02:10:32.558
the two.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24054-0
02:10:32.728 --> 02:10:36.113
This is what you will expect
because they will follow the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24054-1
02:10:36.113 --> 02:10:38.738
standard population 1500 people
20% and 80%.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24063-0
02:10:38.748 --> 02:10:40.098
So you'll get the same right.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24086-0
02:10:40.678 --> 02:10:44.820
So so far we concluded that the
20% of the population play chess

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24086-1
02:10:44.820 --> 02:10:47.178
and 80% population don't play
chess.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24090-0
02:10:47.858 --> 02:10:48.688
Right, right.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24094-0
02:10:48.898 --> 02:10:49.198
Correct.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24096-0
02:10:49.118 --> 02:10:49.258
Yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24119-0
02:10:50.308 --> 02:10:54.407
So we assume the same pattern
for both the both both these

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24110-0
02:10:50.488 --> 02:10:51.918
Now who, like.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24115-0
02:10:52.868 --> 02:10:54.618
OK, OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24119-1
02:10:54.407 --> 02:10:55.588
rows, right? Yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24134-0
02:10:59.578 --> 02:11:00.688
No, no, not 20.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24145-0
02:11:01.038 --> 02:11:01.848
Not no, no, no.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24153-0
02:11:01.718 --> 02:11:01.868
So.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24162-0
02:11:01.858 --> 02:11:04.498
20% of 454 fifty, yes, yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24155-0
02:11:01.938 --> 02:11:02.668
Of 450.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24169-0
02:11:05.068 --> 02:11:05.878
Or total sum.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24172-0
02:11:05.518 --> 02:11:06.768
The total at last.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24178-0
02:11:05.888 --> 02:11:07.978
OK, OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24179-0
02:11:06.838 --> 02:11:08.838
Yeah, total at last sum of row.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24177-0
02:11:07.498 --> 02:11:07.638
Yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24182-0
02:11:11.548 --> 02:11:11.918
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24204-0
02:11:11.928 --> 02:11:17.218
And 20% of not like science is
again 20% of 1050 is 210.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24210-0
02:11:17.808 --> 02:11:18.118
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24213-0
02:11:17.868 --> 02:11:18.028
Yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24214-0
02:11:18.128 --> 02:11:19.668
Then 80% of this OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24229-0
02:11:22.988 --> 02:11:25.858
So the Chi square formula is
this chi square formula.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24238-0
02:11:25.868 --> 02:11:27.618
We said the object would
expected.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24249-0
02:11:27.628 --> 02:11:29.378
I said I I we will take the
example.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24254-0
02:11:29.388 --> 02:11:30.318
So this is the example.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24269-0
02:11:30.428 --> 02:11:33.256
So this is how you compute
observed and expected observed

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24269-1
02:11:33.256 --> 02:11:33.938
will be given.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24327-0
02:11:34.178 --> 02:11:37.892
Expected has to be computed and
then based on that you apply the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24327-1
02:11:37.892 --> 02:11:41.263
formula and you get the chi
square value and then you look

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24327-2
02:11:41.263 --> 02:11:44.519
at the table and this table is
telling you that with 99%

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24327-3
02:11:44.519 --> 02:11:48.118
greater than 99% counter because
Chi Square is more than 10.8.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24358-0
02:11:48.608 --> 02:11:52.640
So if it is 10.8, we are saying
that with the degrees of freedom

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24358-1
02:11:52.640 --> 02:11:55.928
of 1, the null hypothesis has a
chance of only .001.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24388-0
02:11:55.978 --> 02:12:01.387
So alternate hypothesis that is
their correlated has a strength

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24388-1
02:12:01.387 --> 02:12:03.838
of .999, so 99.9% confidence.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24398-0
02:12:03.848 --> 02:12:05.178
You can say that they're
correlated.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24409-0
02:12:06.208 --> 02:12:09.088
Uh, rouser, where in that table
it is lying.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24417-0
02:12:09.138 --> 02:12:11.548
I'm sorry I'm not so many data.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24432-0
02:12:11.558 --> 02:12:13.338
I'm not able to make out.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24451-0
02:12:12.968 --> 02:12:15.902
No, no, this is the first row,
first row, the column first

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24451-1
02:12:15.902 --> 02:12:18.338
column is saying DF which is
degrees of freedom.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24449-0
02:12:17.138 --> 02:12:17.478
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24471-0
02:12:18.668 --> 02:12:21.508
So we what we are saying is that
the degrees of freedom is

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24462-0
02:12:18.758 --> 02:12:19.198
Yes, yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24471-1
02:12:21.508 --> 02:12:22.278
computed as one.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24516-0
02:12:22.688 --> 02:12:26.409
So with one degrees of freedom,
we are looking at the chi square

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24482-0
02:12:22.898 --> 02:12:23.338
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24495-0
02:12:25.488 --> 02:12:26.008
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24516-1
02:12:26.409 --> 02:12:29.901
values and we are seeing that
the value we got is 500, which

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24516-2
02:12:29.901 --> 02:12:30.988
is beyond the .001.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24529-0
02:12:29.988 --> 02:12:31.968
OK 10.8. Ohh.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24531-0
02:12:30.998 --> 02:12:32.758
It will be lesser than .001.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24553-0
02:12:33.138 --> 02:12:36.500
So we are concluding that at
least 99.9% confidence, we can

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24551-0
02:12:35.528 --> 02:12:36.038
Anything.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24553-1
02:12:36.500 --> 02:12:38.068
say that they're correlated.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24555-0
02:12:39.648 --> 02:12:39.998
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24557-0
02:12:40.008 --> 02:12:40.258
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24559-0
02:12:40.268 --> 02:12:40.638
OK. OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24577-0
02:12:43.068 --> 02:12:46.918
OK, so so so the other point is.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24589-0
02:12:46.288 --> 02:12:49.905
So, Sir, are we expected to
remember these formulas and

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24589-1
02:12:49.905 --> 02:12:50.228
when?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24591-0
02:12:50.588 --> 02:12:52.178
Yeah, the formula has to be
remembered.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24619-0
02:12:52.188 --> 02:12:55.237
So the numbers and the chi
square table, you don't need to

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24619-1
02:12:55.237 --> 02:12:56.838
remember the formula has to be.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24652-0
02:12:57.628 --> 02:13:00.790
I'll let the formulas what we
discussed in the though the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24641-0
02:12:59.898 --> 02:13:01.588
Yeah, yeah, the formulas are
you.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24652-1
02:13:00.790 --> 02:13:01.498
calculations.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24643-0
02:13:01.598 --> 02:13:01.828
Yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24646-0
02:13:01.838 --> 02:13:02.248
Yeah, right.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24654-0
02:13:02.258 --> 02:13:03.388
Right, you need to review them.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24660-0
02:13:03.398 --> 02:13:03.778
Yes, yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24666-0
02:13:04.378 --> 02:13:05.708
So it is this.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24669-0
02:13:04.548 --> 02:13:05.378
So at.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24671-0
02:13:05.768 --> 02:13:07.498
Is this the fix table?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24692-0
02:13:09.418 --> 02:13:13.298
Oh, oh, the table you have shown
in at last.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24679-0
02:13:09.628 --> 02:13:10.098
What table?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24697-0
02:13:14.138 --> 02:13:14.278
Yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24698-0
02:13:14.818 --> 02:13:16.128
Yeah, that is a fixed table.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24725-0
02:13:14.928 --> 02:13:17.118
Yet this one that.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24715-0
02:13:16.138 --> 02:13:17.408
It's something like log table.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24717-0
02:13:16.758 --> 02:13:17.668
Yeah, you just fix it.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24735-0
02:13:17.418 --> 02:13:17.888
It is fixed.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24729-0
02:13:17.678 --> 02:13:18.868
Table the guy square table.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24732-0
02:13:18.878 --> 02:13:19.508
You will get it.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24757-0
02:13:19.518 --> 02:13:22.619
You will get it in many you just
search for the web and hundreds

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24757-1
02:13:22.619 --> 02:13:23.668
of websites will have.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24768-0
02:13:24.258 --> 02:13:25.388
Ohh OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24769-0
02:13:24.458 --> 02:13:26.978
So this is a fixed table and
you'll be happy to use this.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24814-0
02:13:30.178 --> 02:13:34.854
So I'm seeing I have few more
slides, but are you fine with

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24782-0
02:13:30.188 --> 02:13:30.548
Whatever.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24808-0
02:13:34.708 --> 02:13:36.978
I said maybe 10.8 to 18.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24814-1
02:13:34.854 --> 02:13:36.568
another 10 minutes or?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24815-0
02:13:36.988 --> 02:13:38.148
What other values are
represented?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24833-0
02:13:39.858 --> 02:13:41.468
OK, I think I will stop here.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24838-0
02:13:41.478 --> 02:13:43.438
Only just I will answer the
questions and close it.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24840-0
02:13:43.448 --> 02:13:43.648
Yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24852-0
02:13:43.658 --> 02:13:45.088
Tell me you have some more
question.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24856-0
02:13:45.358 --> 02:13:45.868
Go ahead.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24862-0
02:13:45.778 --> 02:13:46.398
But thank you.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24863-0
02:13:45.938 --> 02:13:46.548
What is the question?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24869-0
02:13:48.778 --> 02:13:49.428
What is the question?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24882-0
02:13:51.648 --> 02:13:52.228
Alright so.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24886-0
02:13:51.668 --> 02:13:54.698
I said can you just explain that
table once?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24898-0
02:13:55.068 --> 02:13:58.568
Like what exactly those data
sets are representing?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24918-0
02:13:59.768 --> 02:14:01.448
Uh, this ones up?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24915-0
02:14:00.438 --> 02:14:02.548
OK, Mr Desh RATHNA is.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24925-0
02:14:02.558 --> 02:14:04.368
I want to see the chi square
table.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24927-0
02:14:04.378 --> 02:14:04.888
Is that correct?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24942-0
02:14:07.768 --> 02:14:09.598
This table is what you are
asking right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24947-0
02:14:08.238 --> 02:14:08.878
Yes, Sir. Correct.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24951-0
02:14:09.748 --> 02:14:10.988
Or you are asking some other
table.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24955-0
02:14:12.738 --> 02:14:13.268
Correct.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24958-0
02:14:13.758 --> 02:14:14.068
Correct.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24992-0
02:14:13.998 --> 02:14:18.122
So from formula we derive that
the chi square value is 500 plus

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24965-0
02:14:14.108 --> 02:14:14.428
No, no.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24980-0
02:14:14.438 --> 02:14:15.668
Correct the same table.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24994-0
02:14:15.918 --> 02:14:16.968
I just wanted to understand.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/24992-1
02:14:18.122 --> 02:14:18.508
right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25018-0
02:14:18.518 --> 02:14:20.778
So, so how and where it is
fitting and how?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25024-0
02:14:19.018 --> 02:14:21.288
Yes, this is the formula that
gets you chi square.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25020-0
02:14:21.718 --> 02:14:21.948
Yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25026-0
02:14:21.958 --> 02:14:22.318
Yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25035-0
02:14:21.958 --> 02:14:23.308
So we got it 507.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25044-0
02:14:22.328 --> 02:14:24.218
And then yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25041-0
02:14:23.778 --> 02:14:25.488
Now how does it fit and how?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25065-0
02:14:25.498 --> 02:14:30.438
How we can get the conclusion
out of this table that 500?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25059-0
02:14:29.858 --> 02:14:30.188
Yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25089-0
02:14:30.198 --> 02:14:35.167
So that 505 hundred seven with
what we are comparing Sir, how

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25089-1
02:14:35.167 --> 02:14:35.808
is that?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25081-0
02:14:35.418 --> 02:14:35.668
No.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25104-0
02:14:35.678 --> 02:14:39.670
We are comparing actually with
the 10.8 to 8 is greater than

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25104-1
02:14:39.670 --> 02:14:40.128
10.828.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25116-0
02:14:40.438 --> 02:14:43.528
See suppose that you got a chi
square value of eight.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25134-0
02:14:43.878 --> 02:14:47.668
Then you say that it is fitting
between .005 and .002.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25149-0
02:14:47.798 --> 02:14:49.668
You can see that are you able to
see these numbers?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25160-0
02:14:49.188 --> 02:14:50.508
Right, yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25151-0
02:14:50.518 --> 02:14:50.968
Yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25180-0
02:14:51.008 --> 02:14:54.411
So if you got a chi square of
eight, you can say that it is

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25180-1
02:14:54.411 --> 02:14:55.658
between .005 and .002.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25208-0
02:14:55.958 --> 02:15:01.032
Then you will say that it is
99.8% to 99.5%, but then what we

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25208-1
02:15:01.032 --> 02:15:02.178
got is a high.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25249-0
02:15:02.508 --> 02:15:06.536
That is greater than 10.8 to 8,
so we are using only part of the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25249-1
02:15:06.536 --> 02:15:10.439
CHI square table because the chi
square table can go up to any

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25249-2
02:15:10.439 --> 02:15:11.988
number on the right side.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25288-0
02:15:11.998 --> 02:15:16.593
I mean, it can go up to 1000
also, but beyond 10.8 to 8, what

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25295-0
02:15:15.068 --> 02:15:15.338
Umm.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25288-1
02:15:16.593 --> 02:15:20.668
we are saying is that we already
got 99.9% confidence.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25303-0
02:15:21.408 --> 02:15:24.788
So 500 means definitely it is
more than this confidence.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25325-0
02:15:25.418 --> 02:15:29.434
So does it means that the
probability of playing the chess

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25319-0
02:15:28.188 --> 02:15:28.788
OK so.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25325-1
02:15:29.434 --> 02:15:33.450
versus watching that science
fiction movie is almost same,

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25325-2
02:15:33.450 --> 02:15:33.858
right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25327-0
02:15:33.948 --> 02:15:34.538
What?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25348-0
02:15:34.548 --> 02:15:36.748
What it doesn't mean like 99%,
right? What?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25342-0
02:15:36.228 --> 02:15:37.218
No, there is a.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25368-0
02:15:37.288 --> 02:15:41.505
So what we are saying with
confidence is that you cannot

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25368-1
02:15:41.505 --> 02:15:45.722
ignore playing chess when
somebody you also already have

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25368-2
02:15:45.722 --> 02:15:46.758
the values of.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25372-0
02:15:47.188 --> 02:15:47.798
Sorry.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25409-0
02:15:47.888 --> 02:15:51.097
So what we are saying is that
whenever you already know the

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25409-1
02:15:51.097 --> 02:15:54.412
that person is playing chess,
that is significantly impacting

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25409-2
02:15:54.412 --> 02:15:57.727
whether the person will like
science fiction or not, and vice

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25409-3
02:15:57.727 --> 02:15:58.048
versa.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25422-0
02:15:58.818 --> 02:16:01.168
When you know the one variable,
the other variable is

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25425-0
02:15:59.538 --> 02:15:59.878
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25422-1
02:16:01.168 --> 02:16:02.168
significantly impacted.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25440-0
02:16:02.178 --> 02:16:04.760
It doesn't mean that they are
same, but while we are saying is

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25440-1
02:16:04.760 --> 02:16:05.948
it is significantly impacted.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25453-0
02:16:08.998 --> 02:16:12.088
OK, sorry I interrupted someone.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25468-0
02:16:11.718 --> 02:16:14.108
So I have one question, Sir.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25465-0
02:16:12.098 --> 02:16:13.358
If somebody else has asked.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25470-0
02:16:14.428 --> 02:16:14.808
Can I ask?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25477-0
02:16:15.838 --> 02:16:16.228
Yes, yes.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25480-0
02:16:16.228 --> 02:16:17.438
They said I have one question.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25512-0
02:16:17.448 --> 02:16:21.107
So if I understood correctly
what you are trying to explain

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25512-1
02:16:21.107 --> 02:16:24.827
here is that it's basically more
on hypothesis testing S and

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25512-2
02:16:24.827 --> 02:16:27.388
those related to categorical
data, right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25515-0
02:16:27.998 --> 02:16:29.368
Absolutely Mr plugin.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25518-0
02:16:29.418 --> 02:16:29.928
That is correct.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25520-0
02:16:31.198 --> 02:16:31.568
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25523-0
02:16:31.918 --> 02:16:32.358
Thank you, Sir.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25542-0
02:16:34.818 --> 02:16:39.277
So you brought in a new word, so
now I hope nobody else will ask

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25542-1
02:16:39.277 --> 02:16:39.688
again.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25550-0
02:16:39.698 --> 02:16:41.208
Explanation of hypothesis
testing.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25563-0
02:16:41.218 --> 02:16:44.052
So I I didn't bring it because
hypothesis testing is no big

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25563-1
02:16:44.052 --> 02:16:44.288
deal.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25581-0
02:16:44.298 --> 02:16:46.098
So so that is just a word that.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25600-0
02:16:45.468 --> 02:16:49.744
You use things you used in
couple of slide before this word

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25600-1
02:16:49.744 --> 02:16:50.528
hypothesis.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25595-0
02:16:49.818 --> 02:16:50.568
A hypothesis.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25606-0
02:16:50.578 --> 02:16:51.788
I used the word hypothesis.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25638-0
02:16:51.798 --> 02:16:55.518
OK, OK. Yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25604-0
02:16:52.588 --> 02:16:53.078
Right, Sir.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25608-0
02:16:53.088 --> 02:16:53.298
Yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25610-0
02:16:53.488 --> 02:16:53.938
OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25624-0
02:16:54.028 --> 02:16:54.488
Thank you, Sir.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25633-0
02:16:55.548 --> 02:16:56.998
So can you go back to this?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25647-0
02:16:57.048 --> 02:16:59.748
Just that guy square formula.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25657-0
02:17:00.678 --> 02:17:02.068
Sky Square formula this one.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25664-0
02:17:01.138 --> 02:17:02.338
Just I want to say, yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25659-0
02:17:02.218 --> 02:17:02.888
This one right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25669-0
02:17:03.238 --> 02:17:04.118
Yeah, this. Yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25672-0
02:17:04.838 --> 02:17:06.388
Yeah, this one, OK.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25678-0
02:17:15.588 --> 02:17:15.988
Thank you, Sir.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25687-0
02:17:17.058 --> 02:17:19.108
Alright, so are there any
questions?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25707-0
02:17:20.508 --> 02:17:22.738
OK, so if there are no
questions, yeah.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25697-0
02:17:20.708 --> 02:17:21.508
So, Sir, Sir.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25700-0

Yeah, go ahead.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25762-1
02:17:26.872 --> 02:17:30.865
previous slide, observed means
is that can we consider 1500

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25763-0
02:17:30.318 --> 02:17:34.262
No, Joe's observed is actually
the survey result survey result,

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25762-2
02:17:30.865 --> 02:17:33.128
observed no observed is fine

Hello Sir.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25799-0

if you don't mind.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25823-0
02:17:48.448 --> 02:17:54.578
Like can we expect like which
until which lecture we need to

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25823-1
02:17:54.578 --> 02:17:58.598
revisit and then we need to go
through.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25826-0
02:17:58.608 --> 02:17:59.478
Is there any?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25840-0
02:17:59.788 --> 02:18:01.218
Can you can you elaborate on
that?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25852-0
02:18:02.068 --> 02:18:05.853
No, no, it all the things that
are recovered till the last

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25852-1
02:18:05.853 --> 02:18:06.238
class.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25865-0
02:18:06.248 --> 02:18:09.288
So that is I think we are
planning it on 31st, right?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25886-0
02:18:09.598 --> 02:18:13.292

I mean.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25907-0
02:18:20.568 --> 02:18:22.138
Why are you so much concerned?

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25916-0
02:18:22.148 --> 02:18:23.558

02:18:31.179 --> 02:18:36.091
so just spend a few hours on the
lectures or just browsing some

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25973-2
02:18:36.091 --> 02:18:40.618
some things in their textbooks
so I'm sure you'll do that.

9d8bc7b3-0aa7-47d5-9874-6eec517e38f3/25976-0
