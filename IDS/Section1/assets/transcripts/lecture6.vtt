00:00:08.034 --> 00:00:08.524
Good evening.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/118-0
00:00:10.204 --> 00:00:16.206
I hope all the things that we
had discussed so far are clear

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/118-1
00:00:16.206 --> 00:00:21.814
on anything that we should spend
a couple of minutes on.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/142-0
00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:31.684
OK, then what we will do is that
we will go into an essentially a

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/142-1
00:00:31.684 --> 00:00:32.334
new topic.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/144-0
00:00:32.644 --> 00:00:33.474
So.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/176-0
00:00:33.744 --> 00:00:38.241
So what we will do is that we
Start learning how to do a

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/176-1
00:00:38.241 --> 00:00:42.974
modeling so that we generate the
first model from the data.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/205-0
00:00:43.024 --> 00:00:46.990
So essentially we will check how
to do machine learning so that

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/205-1
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.895
given some data we generate a
simple model which is a decision

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/205-2
00:00:50.895 --> 00:00:51.204
tree.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/240-0
00:01:25.094 --> 00:01:30.432
So here are many examples and in
fact classification is one of

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/240-1
00:01:30.432 --> 00:01:32.804
the one of the most popular.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/249-0
00:01:32.814 --> 00:01:34.284
In fact, not one of the IT is
the.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/254-0
00:01:34.334 --> 00:01:37.594
It is possibly the most popular.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/265-0
00:01:41.984 --> 00:01:44.634
Young married task that people
perform.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/276-0
00:01:47.754 --> 00:01:51.134
So there are because this as a
predictive nature.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/311-0
00:01:54.694 --> 00:01:58.245
This is representing a
predictive nature and that this

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/311-1
00:01:58.245 --> 00:02:02.053
is essentially representing a
method of learning from data

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/311-2
00:02:02.053 --> 00:02:04.054
instead of describing the data.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/370-0
00:02:05.154 --> 00:02:09.504
So for that reason, this happens
to be one of the very popular

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/370-1
00:02:09.504 --> 00:02:13.164
task, or in fact the most
popular task that the data

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/370-2
00:02:13.164 --> 00:02:17.169
scientists keep performing,
given some data, do they they

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/370-3
00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:21.105
want to recognize certain
patterns whereby they can make

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/370-4
00:02:21.105 --> 00:02:24.764
predictions about something that
they have not seen.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/381-0
00:02:25.194 --> 00:02:27.534
So a simple example can be that.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/395-0
00:02:28.054 --> 00:02:34.183
So a doctor has been diagnosing
for a disease based on the X

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/395-1
00:02:34.183 --> 00:02:34.584
ray.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/444-0
00:02:36.044 --> 00:02:40.605
So what the person is diagnosing
somethings which are which can

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/444-1
00:02:40.605 --> 00:02:44.881
be diagnosed with the help of X
ray or it can be other than

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/444-2
00:02:44.881 --> 00:02:49.370
other other things like cats can
or or any any other mechanism

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/444-3
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.294
which is creating a report.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/451-0
00:02:52.304 --> 00:02:55.274
So what the machine learning?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/461-0
00:02:55.284 --> 00:02:57.154
How how does the machine
learning help them?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/480-0
00:02:57.364 --> 00:03:00.694
So what their doctors have to do
is that they need to.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/492-0
00:03:00.764 --> 00:03:03.794
They would have diagnosed
possibly thousands of patients.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/530-0
00:03:04.264 --> 00:03:08.763
They need to create a training
data so the training data shows

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/530-1
00:03:08.763 --> 00:03:13.261
the xrays which indicate that
the disease is present and the X

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/530-2
00:03:13.261 --> 00:03:16.974
rays that indicate that the
disease is not present.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/585-0
00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:22.051
So once this training is done on
the machine, so after the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/585-1
00:03:22.051 --> 00:03:26.662
training is done, if a new X ray
is given for whom the diagnosis

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/585-2
00:03:26.662 --> 00:03:30.920
or the conclusion is not drawn,
the machine will be able to

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/585-3
00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.254
conclude whether the person has
disease or so.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/591-0
00:03:34.264 --> 00:03:35.234
That is an example.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/646-0
00:03:35.244 --> 00:03:40.172
So the reason why I gave the
example is that this is this is

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/646-1
00:03:40.172 --> 00:03:45.261
a classification, is a task that
is very popular in many, many

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/646-2
00:03:45.261 --> 00:03:49.947
domains for solving ohh various
business problems and and

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/646-3
00:03:49.947 --> 00:03:55.036
meanwhile you would have read
some about 10 examples that have

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/646-4
00:03:55.036 --> 00:03:55.924
been given.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/654-0
00:03:56.154 --> 00:03:58.274
All of them are representing the
classification.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/669-0
00:04:03.164 --> 00:04:06.455
So now let's see the
nomenclature right

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/669-1
00:04:06.455 --> 00:04:08.594
classification prediction.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/692-0
00:04:08.604 --> 00:04:13.357
All our predictive tasks, but
when you are predicting a

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/692-1
00:04:13.357 --> 00:04:17.684
categorical label, we call this
as classification.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/695-0
00:04:23.294 --> 00:04:24.174
So.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/702-0
00:04:24.224 --> 00:04:25.504
So what are the examples?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/716-0
00:04:25.614 --> 00:04:30.604
So here what is the class labels
will buy or will not buy right?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/741-0
00:04:42.214 --> 00:04:48.448
So similarly, you can think of
many classes, so classes may not

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/741-1
00:04:48.448 --> 00:04:50.104
be too always so.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/760-0
00:04:50.174 --> 00:04:57.053
So in this case you can see that
the classes are distinction

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/760-1
00:04:57.053 --> 00:04:59.984
Merit, Pass, fail so he M.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/800-0
00:05:01.074 --> 00:05:05.630
BF so there are four classes so
so the classes can be any

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/800-1
00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.029
number, but they are all
categorical variables and when

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/800-2
00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:14.270
we are predicting that
categorical label then we call

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/800-3
00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.684
it classification.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/806-0
00:05:16.514 --> 00:05:17.724
What about prediction?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/825-0
00:05:18.294 --> 00:05:22.034
Prediction is when we are
predicting a continuous valued

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/825-1
00:05:22.034 --> 00:05:24.264
function, so it can be like
this.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/833-0
00:05:24.314 --> 00:05:26.544
Say, let's say we are.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/869-0
00:05:26.794 --> 00:05:31.577
We are checking out on the
apartments that are available in

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/869-1
00:05:31.577 --> 00:05:36.599
certain locality and you learned
the data that the 1000 square

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/869-2
00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:40.824
foot department is costing some
latency arbitrarily.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/883-0
00:05:40.834 --> 00:05:46.364
Let's put 50,00,000 and 1200
square foot is costing.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/901-0
00:05:48.714 --> 00:05:53.664
Costing 65,00,000 and you intend
to buy an apartment?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/906-0
00:05:53.854 --> 00:05:54.544
You got a.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/974-0
00:05:54.554 --> 00:05:59.905
You looked at a new APT 1100
square foot and let me also put

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/974-1
00:05:59.905 --> 00:06:04.467
something 900 square foot
apartment is costing some

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/974-2
00:06:04.467 --> 00:06:10.081
43,00,000 and now you found an
apartment which has got a square

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/974-3
00:06:10.081 --> 00:06:15.256
foot of 11150 square foot and
you want to know what is the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/974-4
00:06:15.256 --> 00:06:18.414
price that you should be paying
so.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/981-0
00:06:18.464 --> 00:06:20.874
So this is representing a
prediction.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/990-0
00:06:20.884 --> 00:06:22.474
So this is also a predictive
task.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1001-0
00:06:23.384 --> 00:06:26.184
But then here you are predicting
a numerical value.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1015-0
00:06:28.394 --> 00:06:32.474
So the classification is an
example of supervised ML.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1034-0
00:06:39.054 --> 00:06:43.963
And there are many unsupervised
ML as well, so they include

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1034-1
00:06:43.963 --> 00:06:45.844
clustering association.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1048-0
00:06:59.114 --> 00:06:59.734
The Sacco.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1049-0
00:07:00.374 --> 00:07:01.744
I hope it is clear so far.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1059-0
00:07:01.754 --> 00:07:03.074
I'm just checking whether there.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1065-0
00:07:04.294 --> 00:07:05.744
So just one small question.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1087-0
00:07:05.814 --> 00:07:11.020
In the example of square feet
and and the amount, the amount

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1087-1
00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.434
was continuous valued and
denomination.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1104-0
00:07:14.444 --> 00:07:16.364
The square feet should be
considered discrete or

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1097-0
00:07:15.654 --> 00:07:16.464
Yes, Sir.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1104-1
00:07:16.364 --> 00:07:16.794
continuous.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1126-0
00:07:16.474 --> 00:07:20.634
So I think there is nothing new
like these squidge purpose of

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1126-1
00:07:20.634 --> 00:07:24.324
the switch is that you just
learn continuous learning.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1136-0
00:07:24.334 --> 00:07:26.224
So don't keep it for the last
minute.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1142-0
00:07:26.684 --> 00:07:28.724
So that is it, right?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1155-0
00:07:29.614 --> 00:07:33.410
So so there will be there, maybe
even questions on today's

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1155-1
00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:33.924
session.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1157-0
00:07:33.934 --> 00:07:34.234
Why not?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1162-0
00:07:36.054 --> 00:07:37.314
Some something right?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1177-0
00:07:49.024 --> 00:07:53.354
OK, I hope I hope that is ES.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1174-0
00:07:50.464 --> 00:07:50.684
Last.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1183-0
00:07:53.424 --> 00:07:55.194
Am I hearing something new?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1185-0
00:07:55.244 --> 00:07:55.604
No.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1195-0
00:07:55.654 --> 00:07:56.224
OK, OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1191-0
00:07:57.104 --> 00:07:57.514
Yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1198-0
00:07:57.524 --> 00:07:58.644
So can you go to the last slide?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1202-0
00:08:01.464 --> 00:08:02.774
Somebody is speaking.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1219-0
00:08:03.244 --> 00:08:04.134
I do not know whether.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1209-0
00:08:03.494 --> 00:08:03.744
Yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1223-0
00:08:03.754 --> 00:08:04.774
Can you go to the last slide?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1227-0
00:08:06.064 --> 00:08:07.344
Oh, Mr Arindam.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1231-0
00:08:07.424 --> 00:08:09.254
OK, OK, alright.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1245-0
00:08:09.344 --> 00:08:12.594
So it looks like my mic, I put
it on mute.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1249-0
00:08:12.684 --> 00:08:13.134
OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1259-0
00:08:13.264 --> 00:08:14.904
Is this the slide or the one
before?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1263-0
00:08:16.014 --> 00:08:16.454
Yes, yes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1269-0
00:08:17.384 --> 00:08:18.424
This one or before.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1284-0
00:08:19.444 --> 00:08:20.384
Yeah, this one, this one.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1275-0
00:08:20.784 --> 00:08:21.194
This one.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1278-0
00:08:21.204 --> 00:08:21.654
OK, OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1280-0
00:08:21.664 --> 00:08:21.894
Sure.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1296-0
00:08:21.904 --> 00:08:27.513
Please look at it and we are
also going into couple of

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1296-1
00:08:27.513 --> 00:08:28.634
references.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1302-0
00:08:28.644 --> 00:08:29.794
One is the Gartner.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1326-0
00:08:30.144 --> 00:08:33.614
So because they this is the
broad classification of machine

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1326-1
00:08:33.614 --> 00:08:35.984
learning is supervised and
unsupervised.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1334-0
00:08:36.414 --> 00:08:40.654
But there are many authors who
also include semi supervised.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1347-0
00:08:43.234 --> 00:08:45.334
Many authors include semi
supervised.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1352-0
00:08:44.654 --> 00:08:48.064
You not supervised learning fast
point.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1366-0
00:08:48.074 --> 00:08:50.794
You mentioned the class labels
have training data is unknown.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1373-0
00:08:52.554 --> 00:08:53.924
Can you give an example means?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1390-0
00:08:55.394 --> 00:08:58.208
OK, so you are you want an
example for supervised machine

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1390-1
00:08:58.208 --> 00:08:58.984
learning, right?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1392-0
00:08:59.874 --> 00:09:00.254
Unsupervised.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1406-0
00:09:01.504 --> 00:09:05.968
Unsupervised machine learning is
suppose that you got many

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1406-1
00:09:05.968 --> 00:09:06.724
customers.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1440-0
00:09:07.024 --> 00:09:11.869
Ohh yeah for your company and
you want to group them for some

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1440-1
00:09:11.869 --> 00:09:16.323
reason so that you will be able
to assign suitable level

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1440-2
00:09:16.323 --> 00:09:20.074
relationship manager so that is
a unsupervised.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1451-0
00:09:22.604 --> 00:09:24.134
So you want to just group them?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1454-0
00:09:22.614 --> 00:09:22.854
OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1457-0
00:09:24.144 --> 00:09:24.994
There is no really.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1477-0
00:09:25.004 --> 00:09:28.115
OK, forget about the purpose
because you want to group them

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1477-1
00:09:28.115 --> 00:09:30.084
so that it is easy to manage for
you.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1488-0
00:09:33.064 --> 00:09:35.444
Based on attributes of the
customer, nothing else.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1493-0
00:09:37.054 --> 00:09:37.864
Does that help?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1500-0
00:09:37.844 --> 00:09:38.104
OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1508-0
00:09:37.994 --> 00:09:41.074
So that is in fact the very most
popular application of

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1508-1
00:09:41.074 --> 00:09:42.724
unsupervised machine learning.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1525-0
00:09:42.794 --> 00:09:45.794
So customer has many attributes
and based on that your group.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1539-0
00:09:47.264 --> 00:09:48.294
So said insult.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1546-0
00:09:47.744 --> 00:09:50.684
And we will see, yes, some
something.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1567-0
00:09:49.914 --> 00:09:53.856
OK, so that in supervised
learning in supervised learning,

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1567-1
00:09:53.856 --> 00:09:57.597
whatever data we are taking,
whatever attributes we are

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1558-0
00:09:54.394 --> 00:09:54.734
Umm.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1573-0
00:09:56.524 --> 00:09:58.684
Hmm. Yes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1567-2
00:09:57.597 --> 00:09:58.064
taking.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1579-0
00:09:58.574 --> 00:10:01.404
OK, so we know the output of
that.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1601-0
00:10:01.414 --> 00:10:03.774
What's the resultant is that?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1591-0
00:10:02.274 --> 00:10:03.004
That is correct.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1594-0
00:10:03.274 --> 00:10:04.044
That is correct.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1629-0
00:10:03.834 --> 00:10:07.511
So in supervised machine
learning, what we are saying is

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1773-0
00:10:04.344 --> 00:10:04.554
No.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1629-1
00:10:07.511 --> 00:10:11.704
that suppose that we have we are
doing it for medical diagnosis.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1650-0
00:10:12.034 --> 00:10:15.227
So based on the symptoms, the
doctor knows that this person

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1650-1
00:10:15.227 --> 00:10:16.184
has copied or not.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1680-0
00:10:16.234 --> 00:10:20.424
They have identified 10 symptoms
and they put the 10 symptoms and

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1680-1
00:10:20.424 --> 00:10:24.170
based on that the they have
diagnosed the person has COVID

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1680-2
00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:24.614
or not.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1693-0
00:10:24.904 --> 00:10:28.984
Now they train the machine based
on this.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1728-0
00:10:29.024 --> 00:10:33.301
They have observed 10,000 people
and they found that out of them

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1728-1
00:10:33.301 --> 00:10:37.249
500 have coded COVID and 9500
don't have kovid and now they

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1728-2
00:10:37.249 --> 00:10:39.354
give to the machine saying that.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1767-0
00:10:39.364 --> 00:10:42.405
Look at these ten symptoms and
look at my diagnosis and based

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1767-1
00:10:42.405 --> 00:10:45.495
on that in the future you give
the only the symptoms, then the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1767-2
00:10:45.495 --> 00:10:47.064
machine will tell the diagnosis.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1770-0
00:10:47.444 --> 00:10:48.114
A mystery.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1772-0
00:10:48.124 --> 00:10:48.604
Are we clear?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1780-0
00:10:50.584 --> 00:10:51.044
Yes, Sir.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1781-0
00:10:51.904 --> 00:10:52.764
OK, alright.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1786-0
00:10:59.964 --> 00:11:00.634
OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1795-0
00:11:00.774 --> 00:11:03.254
OK, let let us go into this.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1800-0
00:11:03.424 --> 00:11:05.034
There is nothing really.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1831-0
00:11:05.144 --> 00:11:09.139
I just wanted to give you
examples where from the the this

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1831-1
00:11:09.139 --> 00:11:12.794
is a Gartner is an agency that
you may have heard of.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1845-0
00:11:12.804 --> 00:11:17.378
So in this article they define
the examples of supervised,

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1845-1
00:11:17.378 --> 00:11:20.014
unsupervised and semi
supervised.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1867-0
00:11:20.364 --> 00:11:23.435
So supervised, they're talking
about some examples which are

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1867-1
00:11:23.435 --> 00:11:26.354
pretty much similar to the
examples that we talked about.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1869-0
00:11:26.554 --> 00:11:27.064
OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1898-0
00:11:27.104 --> 00:11:32.515
And unsupervised they are giving
the examples OK how to group

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1898-1
00:11:32.515 --> 00:11:38.274
various things, so again be only
based on the data, nothing else.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1925-0
00:11:38.284 --> 00:11:41.218
You don't have any class label,
you're only grouping based on

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1925-1
00:11:41.218 --> 00:11:43.726
data and then you can also have
something known as a

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1925-2
00:11:43.726 --> 00:11:44.814
reinforcement learning.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1944-0
00:11:45.244 --> 00:11:48.352
Reinforcement learning is where
you are trying to teach a

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1944-1
00:11:48.352 --> 00:11:50.174
machine what are the good
things.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1981-0
00:11:50.364 --> 00:11:54.022
For example, you want to teach a
car how to do a self driving, so

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1981-1
00:11:54.022 --> 00:11:57.069
there is a machine in the car
which is actually giving

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1981-2
00:11:57.069 --> 00:12:00.394
instructions for the steering
and acceleration and braking.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1997-0
00:12:00.884 --> 00:12:03.711
So the machine is doing
controlling them, not the human

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/1997-1
00:12:03.711 --> 00:12:04.064
driver.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2048-0
00:12:04.394 --> 00:12:08.554
So in that case, the way you
train the car is by doing the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2048-1
00:12:08.554 --> 00:12:12.926
reinforcement learning where you
keep on if the car goes very

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2048-2
00:12:12.926 --> 00:12:17.368
close to another car, then you
give a negative points when the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2048-3
00:12:17.368 --> 00:12:20.964
car skips on the lanes without
giving any warning.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2083-0
00:12:20.974 --> 00:12:24.585
Then you give negative points
and if the car goes at it steady

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2083-1
00:12:24.585 --> 00:12:28.195
speed, you give positive points
and by doing that you are able

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2083-2
00:12:28.195 --> 00:12:30.544
to train the car to do the
self-driving.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2116-0
00:12:30.874 --> 00:12:34.450
Similarly, you can do the
several types of training, for

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2116-1
00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:38.025
example robo training or
training to play some game, and

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2116-2
00:12:38.025 --> 00:12:40.534
these are the places where there
is no.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2154-0
00:12:40.684 --> 00:12:44.137
What you do is that you keep
giving the points based on the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2154-1
00:12:44.137 --> 00:12:47.704
steps that they take, and once
they observe what what actions

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2154-2
00:12:47.704 --> 00:12:51.214
will get them, what type of
points, because they can be many

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2154-3
00:12:51.214 --> 00:12:51.674
actions.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2176-0
00:12:51.684 --> 00:12:55.279
For example, playing chess,
there can be thousands of moves

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2176-1
00:12:55.279 --> 00:12:58.034
that the that they that the
machine can take.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2214-0
00:12:58.464 --> 00:13:01.507
But by learning that some move
is going to get them positive

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2214-1
00:13:01.507 --> 00:13:04.301
points, some move is negative
points in that particular

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2214-2
00:13:04.301 --> 00:13:07.244
environment, they're going to
learn how to play the chess.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2222-0
00:13:09.024 --> 00:13:10.574
OK, so this is the.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2237-0
00:13:10.644 --> 00:13:15.992
This is the Gartner's example
and let me also quickly go to

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2237-1
00:13:15.992 --> 00:13:16.794
somebody.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2255-0
00:13:16.844 --> 00:13:23.491
Some expert has put uh uh, this
is, I think uh taken from the uh

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2255-1
00:13:23.491 --> 00:13:24.104
the X.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2270-0
00:13:24.834 --> 00:13:28.428
Ah, this is a picture posted by
someone to indicate that not

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2270-1
00:13:28.428 --> 00:13:29.134
three types.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2280-0
00:13:29.144 --> 00:13:30.634
There are four types of machine
learning.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2282-0
00:13:30.884 --> 00:13:31.734
That is true.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2292-0
00:13:31.744 --> 00:13:33.554
There are authors, there is a
there is.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2318-0
00:13:33.564 --> 00:13:37.404
There are authors who are
generally say that there are

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2318-1
00:13:37.404 --> 00:13:41.174
four, but some authors, for
example in our T1 and T4.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2326-0
00:13:41.344 --> 00:13:43.494
Most probably they don't talk
about four types.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2348-0
00:13:43.504 --> 00:13:46.667
They still stick with mostly
about two types, but they may

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2348-1
00:13:46.667 --> 00:13:48.704
have taken the example of third
type.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2351-0
00:13:49.594 --> 00:13:50.264
So.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2375-0
00:13:50.314 --> 00:13:53.663
So the point is, don't worry if
the very common ones are

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2375-1
00:13:53.663 --> 00:13:57.304
supervised and unsupervised semi
supervised comes in between.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2387-0
00:13:57.554 --> 00:14:01.263
Reinforcement is with respect to
not using the data, but

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2387-1
00:14:01.263 --> 00:14:02.694
penalties and rewards.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2396-0
00:14:05.714 --> 00:14:08.354
OK, so now let us proceed little
further.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2405-0
00:14:11.044 --> 00:14:13.184
So how does classification work?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2417-0
00:14:14.024 --> 00:14:19.384
So classification is way you you
do a 2 steps.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2423-0
00:14:20.374 --> 00:14:23.294
First step is that you build a
model.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2432-0
00:14:25.244 --> 00:14:26.374
How do you build a model?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2435-0
00:14:26.804 --> 00:14:28.104
You have an algorithm.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2459-0
00:14:30.454 --> 00:14:35.958
You have data data which is all
preprocessed and quality checked

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2459-1
00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.244
so that you give that data.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2465-0
00:14:38.394 --> 00:14:41.334
Both of them are given two
machine.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2474-0
00:14:44.294 --> 00:14:47.034
And what does a machine output a
model?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2490-0
00:14:49.164 --> 00:14:50.784
In model can take many shapes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2516-0
00:14:50.794 --> 00:14:55.230
The model can be as good as
simply an equation or model can

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2516-1
00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:59.444
be a rule or model, can be a
graph like a decision tree.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2547-0
00:14:59.934 --> 00:15:05.028
So there are various types of
models that the machine can

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2547-1
00:15:05.028 --> 00:15:10.474
build, so all of them have the
purpose that they can help you

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2547-2
00:15:10.474 --> 00:15:13.284
in predicting for unseen tuples.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2553-0
00:15:13.614 --> 00:15:14.934
What is the class labels?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2563-0
00:15:17.344 --> 00:15:18.424
I hope I don't need to.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2570-0
00:15:20.184 --> 00:15:21.654
Read the rest.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2595-0
00:15:21.714 --> 00:15:26.743
I I think that my explanation
covers all that I wanted to

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2595-1
00:15:26.743 --> 00:15:31.684
point out, so model usage is
that you have a test tuple.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2603-0
00:15:36.454 --> 00:15:37.854
Then you have a model.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2614-0
00:15:39.934 --> 00:15:44.654
And then output is prediction
predict the label.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2630-0
00:15:48.304 --> 00:15:51.044
So the label in case of a we are
analyzing.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2649-0
00:15:51.054 --> 00:15:55.486
Uh, let us say the customers who
are likely to buy our fancy

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2649-1
00:15:55.486 --> 00:15:55.994
gadget.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2667-0
00:15:56.074 --> 00:15:59.392
Then the labels can be either
will buy our product or will not

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2667-1
00:15:59.392 --> 00:16:00.234
buy the product.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2741-0
00:16:00.544 --> 00:16:04.839
So if we if we are doing it for
a medical domain to help assist

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2741-1
00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:08.463
the doctor in making a
diagnosis, then the person has

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2741-2
00:16:08.463 --> 00:16:12.557
disease or does not have the
disease and similarly there can

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2741-3
00:16:12.557 --> 00:16:16.785
be for example use student with
the performance is going to be

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2741-4
00:16:16.785 --> 00:16:21.080
good or not good and similarly
is the weather going to be sunny

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2741-5
00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:21.684
or rainy.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2790-0
00:16:21.694 --> 00:16:26.701
So in all these cases we are we
have many attributes and we have

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2790-1
00:16:26.701 --> 00:16:31.399
and then we know the labels
based on our historical data and

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2790-2
00:16:31.399 --> 00:16:36.175
then we use that and then we
provide them to the machine with

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2790-3
00:16:36.175 --> 00:16:37.484
a good algorithm.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2801-0
00:16:37.494 --> 00:16:41.974
So that machine will learn from
the data and create a model.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2819-0
00:16:43.644 --> 00:16:47.764
OK, so this is the illustration
of what we discussed in the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2819-1
00:16:47.764 --> 00:16:48.794
previous class.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2824-0
00:16:48.904 --> 00:16:50.814
So sorry, previous slide.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2827-0
00:16:50.964 --> 00:16:52.444
This is the training data.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2848-0
00:16:55.034 --> 00:16:59.228
So this has been preprocessed
and validated so that we know

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2848-1
00:16:59.228 --> 00:17:01.324
the class labels are accurate.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2893-0
00:17:01.334 --> 00:17:05.949
We remove the noise outliers and
missing data and all types of

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2893-1
00:17:05.949 --> 00:17:10.563
problems that may exist in the
data we cleaned it up, and then

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2893-2
00:17:10.563 --> 00:17:14.884
we did this training data and we
gave them to the machine.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2898-0
00:17:14.974 --> 00:17:16.194
So this is the machine.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2952-0
00:17:18.554 --> 00:17:23.302
So what happened is we are
giving that data and then the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2952-1
00:17:23.302 --> 00:17:28.467
algorithm and then machine is
going to run the algorithm with

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2952-2
00:17:28.467 --> 00:17:33.548
the on with the data and is
going to create a model and then

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2949-0
00:17:33.374 --> 00:17:33.684
I don't.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2952-3
00:17:33.548 --> 00:17:34.214
once we.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2961-0
00:17:33.694 --> 00:17:37.534
We take the don't we check the
accuracy of the models?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2981-0
00:17:39.854 --> 00:17:41.694
Mr Shamshad, can you repeat the
question?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3006-0
00:17:42.474 --> 00:17:45.462
And on which check the accuracy
of the models of whatever

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/2999-0
00:17:45.164 --> 00:17:46.374
Yes, yes, you are jumping.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3006-1
00:17:45.462 --> 00:17:45.874
details.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3003-0
00:17:46.384 --> 00:17:47.094
You're jumping.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3022-0
00:17:47.104 --> 00:17:49.761
So so you are probably talking
about what I should tell

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3019-0
00:17:47.894 --> 00:17:48.584
OK, I'm sorry.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3022-1
00:17:49.761 --> 00:17:50.614
afterwards, right?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3030-0
00:17:50.994 --> 00:17:52.504
So I yeah, we'll come to that.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3037-0
00:17:52.514 --> 00:17:53.194
We'll come to that.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3056-0
00:17:53.244 --> 00:17:56.018
Obviously first thing is that
you have to construct the model

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3056-1
00:17:56.018 --> 00:17:58.254
right, then only there is a
question of accuracy.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3060-0
00:18:05.644 --> 00:18:05.914
Focus.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3062-0
00:18:07.814 --> 00:18:08.164
Great.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3072-0
00:18:11.904 --> 00:18:15.754
OK, so there are many
classification techniques.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3083-0
00:18:16.104 --> 00:18:19.224
So our intent today is to
discuss.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3098-0
00:18:20.584 --> 00:18:25.614
Discuss the decision tree, but
there are many methods.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3107-0
00:18:25.624 --> 00:18:28.274
For example, today there is a.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3144-0
00:18:28.324 --> 00:18:32.974
This is a become a very popular
approach, so we will not have an

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3144-1
00:18:32.974 --> 00:18:37.195
opportunity to cover this in
this course, but this will be

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3144-2
00:18:37.195 --> 00:18:40.914
covered in the machine learning
and future courses.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3172-0
00:18:40.924 --> 00:18:44.368
Hopefully in future courses I'm
not sure machine learning

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3172-1
00:18:44.368 --> 00:18:47.693
include only in deep learning
whatever, but then neural

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3172-2
00:18:47.693 --> 00:18:49.414
networks is becoming popular.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3182-0
00:18:49.424 --> 00:18:52.724
For example, the solutions such
as uh, ohh.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3191-0
00:18:52.734 --> 00:18:55.014
Such as what we have is a chart,
Gupta.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3199-0
00:18:56.714 --> 00:18:57.694
Or uh, Gemini.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3202-0
00:18:59.494 --> 00:19:01.104
These are all products of.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3241-0
00:19:03.174 --> 00:19:07.282
That you real networks, they
need a powerful neural networks

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3241-1
00:19:07.282 --> 00:19:11.323
in order to conclude because
they generally represent these

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3241-2
00:19:11.323 --> 00:19:15.364
can take parameters that run
into that run into billions of

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3241-3
00:19:15.364 --> 00:19:16.104
parameters.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3254-0
00:19:17.364 --> 00:19:20.434
So they can take solve very
complex problems.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3276-0
00:19:22.894 --> 00:19:27.213
Presently we have a a neural
networks with I think trillion

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3276-1
00:19:27.213 --> 00:19:28.004
parameters.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3289-0
00:19:28.014 --> 00:19:30.764
I'm not sure whether we have it,
but 100 billion parameters.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3310-0
00:19:30.774 --> 00:19:34.505
I understand there are neural
networks that depend on so many

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3310-1
00:19:34.505 --> 00:19:38.054
parameters to do this, and then
this is probability based.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3325-0
00:19:40.794 --> 00:19:44.514
And rule based is actually very
close cousin of Decision Tree.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3350-0
00:19:44.794 --> 00:19:50.107
So we will, we will hopefully
we'll see that then support

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3350-1
00:19:50.107 --> 00:19:56.062
vector machine is is a way of of
differentiating differentiating

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3350-2
00:19:56.062 --> 00:19:57.344
in hyperspace.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3383-0
00:19:57.554 --> 00:20:01.850
So what we do is that we create
a hyperplane because when when

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3383-1
00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:06.213
it is A2 dimensional plane so we
align can separate saying that

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3383-2
00:20:06.213 --> 00:20:06.554
well.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3387-0
00:20:06.634 --> 00:20:06.894
No.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3408-0
00:20:07.404 --> 00:20:16.069
Ohh so we can say that this is
class one and and the seeds

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3408-1
00:20:16.069 --> 00:20:17.244
Class 2.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3423-0
00:20:17.294 --> 00:20:20.575
So we can say that one line is
separating out the elements of

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3423-1
00:20:20.575 --> 00:20:21.104
class one.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3464-0
00:20:21.234 --> 00:20:24.396
This is in two dimensional space
which is very simple to

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3464-1
00:20:24.396 --> 00:20:28.002
visualize, but then what happens
is that we know that many times

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3464-2
00:20:28.002 --> 00:20:31.274
for problems we may have to run
with 100 dimensions or 100

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3464-3
00:20:31.274 --> 00:20:31.884
attributes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3519-0
00:20:32.294 --> 00:20:36.671
So in 100 dimensional space what
you have is a hyperplane that

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3519-1
00:20:36.671 --> 00:20:41.048
separates out after significant
transformation of the data you

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3519-2
00:20:41.048 --> 00:20:45.007
create that new space 100
dimensional space and then you

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3519-3
00:20:45.007 --> 00:20:49.245
find the hyperspace that is
going to distinguish the objects

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3519-4
00:20:49.245 --> 00:20:50.634
of multiple classes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3548-0
00:20:51.044 --> 00:20:53.629
So as a matter of fact, this
here I have taken again in a

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3548-1
00:20:53.629 --> 00:20:56.258
very simple example of two
classes, but it can be multiple

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3548-2
00:20:56.258 --> 00:20:56.614
classes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3565-0
00:20:56.964 --> 00:21:00.019
So in that case, if it is
multiple classes then you need

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3565-1
00:21:00.019 --> 00:21:01.144
to think in terms of.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3575-0
00:21:04.124 --> 00:21:07.704
And so you can have multiple
planes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3592-0
00:21:07.714 --> 00:21:14.244
So, so so that way, uh, you are
able to make the predictions.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3594-0
00:21:14.674 --> 00:21:15.204
OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3628-0
00:21:15.344 --> 00:21:19.403
So with respect to
classification, there is another

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3628-1
00:21:19.403 --> 00:21:24.477
concept that we need to learn is
that the classifier can take an

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3628-2
00:21:24.477 --> 00:21:29.394
approach which is either laggy
audit classifier, can be eager.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3637-0
00:21:30.614 --> 00:21:34.104
So what does a lady classifier
do?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3653-0
00:21:34.344 --> 00:21:39.975
So it you give it an algorithm
and you give it the training

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3653-1
00:21:39.975 --> 00:21:40.444
data.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3665-0
00:21:40.794 --> 00:21:42.684
What it does is that it keeps
both of them.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3680-0
00:21:42.934 --> 00:21:46.684
It does nothing until it test
data comes up.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3688-0
00:21:47.234 --> 00:21:50.644
The moment test data comes up,
it starts running.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3707-0
00:21:51.154 --> 00:21:56.659
It uses 3 parameters, so in fact
the lazy classifier you just

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3707-1
00:21:56.659 --> 00:21:59.144
three parameters test tuple.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3712-0
00:22:03.094 --> 00:22:04.774
Then training data.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3716-0
00:22:08.474 --> 00:22:09.574
And then algorithm.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3732-0
00:22:13.744 --> 00:22:19.954
At the same time, and then the
machine will do a label.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3744-0
00:22:20.204 --> 00:22:24.444
It is going to make a
prediction, so this is it.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3756-0
00:22:24.454 --> 00:22:27.994
Waits until the test tuple comes
so that is.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3830-0
00:22:28.004 --> 00:22:32.579
It doesn't take any spend any
time in training, but then the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3830-1
00:22:32.579 --> 00:22:36.778
lazy classifiers are known to
you, known to have better

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3830-2
00:22:36.778 --> 00:22:41.427
performance with respect to the
accuracy because the the test

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3830-3
00:22:41.427 --> 00:22:46.001
they wait till the test tuple
comes, then they start looking

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3830-4
00:22:46.001 --> 00:22:50.425
at the training tuples which
have a close association with

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3830-5
00:22:50.425 --> 00:22:54.774
the test tuples and so it uses a
better hypothesis space.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3843-0
00:22:55.164 --> 00:22:59.865
It doesn't use the entire
training space so so that way

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3843-1
00:22:59.865 --> 00:23:00.284
what?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3870-0
00:23:00.594 --> 00:23:05.938
Uh, so so that so this is like a
we already know that customer

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3870-1
00:23:05.938 --> 00:23:09.924
which are the customers who
bought the gadget.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3878-0
00:23:10.744 --> 00:23:14.914
So we know their profile various
attributes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3950-0
00:23:15.244 --> 00:23:19.231
So what we do is that when a new
test data comes in, we what we

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3950-1
00:23:19.231 --> 00:23:23.031
do is that instead of building
the model, we start comparing

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3950-2
00:23:23.031 --> 00:23:27.017
with the entire training set to
see which are the most relevant

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3950-3
00:23:27.017 --> 00:23:30.630
ones for assessing the new test
tuple for whom we need to

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3950-4
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:34.554
evaluate whether the person is
going to buy our gadget or not.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3964-0
00:23:35.044 --> 00:23:39.034
So they buy it, gets a better
hypothesis space.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3971-0
00:23:39.504 --> 00:23:40.754
But then what is the problem?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3980-0
00:23:41.234 --> 00:23:43.404
It takes a lot more time in
making the prediction.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3989-0
00:23:48.314 --> 00:23:49.874
So can I ask a quick question?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/3995-0
00:23:51.244 --> 00:23:52.304
Yes, yes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4009-0
00:23:52.314 --> 00:23:56.339
Uh, she here in lazy
classification, which we are

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4009-1
00:23:56.339 --> 00:23:57.224
mentioning.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4021-0
00:23:57.594 --> 00:24:03.914
So like if the test data is less
so and so.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4055-0
00:24:03.924 --> 00:24:08.299
Sorry if the training data set
is large and the test data is

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4049-0
00:24:06.684 --> 00:24:08.504
Yes, umm.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4055-1
00:24:08.299 --> 00:24:12.314
more then will will this
algorithm be applicable there?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4068-0
00:24:13.724 --> 00:24:17.094
See, it is applicable
everywhere, so nothing like.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4113-0
00:24:17.164 --> 00:24:20.345
So if you are saying that
training data is low so that

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4113-1
00:24:20.345 --> 00:24:24.104
itself means that you are having
you, you you first have because

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4113-2
00:24:24.104 --> 00:24:27.632
the moment you mentioned low,
you are saying expressing some

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4113-3
00:24:27.632 --> 00:24:30.234
level of a lack of confidence
with the data.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4121-0
00:24:30.284 --> 00:24:31.454
Am I right, Mr Ketan?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4124-0
00:24:32.634 --> 00:24:33.464
Yeah, yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4132-0
00:24:33.554 --> 00:24:34.084
Yes, Sir.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4183-0
00:24:34.054 --> 00:24:37.616
That is, that is because that is
because we we talked about

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4148-0
00:24:34.094 --> 00:24:35.824
Where like can be a scenario.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4183-1
00:24:37.616 --> 00:24:41.059
examples saying that why
somebody cannot make credit card

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4183-2
00:24:41.059 --> 00:24:44.857
prediction because they do not
have sufficient data or relevant

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4183-3
00:24:44.857 --> 00:24:48.300
data or or are the kind of
diversity that you require for

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4183-4
00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:48.834
the data.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4195-0
00:24:48.934 --> 00:24:51.314
So possibly you you are
represent.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4197-0
00:24:50.194 --> 00:24:51.264
Finally I went out.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4198-0
00:24:53.024 --> 00:24:53.214
Yes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4204-0
00:24:55.094 --> 00:24:56.084
Uh, Mr Ketan.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4207-0
00:24:56.094 --> 00:24:56.584
So.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4251-0
00:24:56.634 --> 00:25:00.749
So the point is, yes, you can
certainly use but you but then

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4251-1
00:25:00.749 --> 00:25:04.459
you are going to take call
because for example if your

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4251-2
00:25:04.459 --> 00:25:08.640
company has to invest 50 crores
in new plank hoping that this

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4251-3
00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.124
gadget will sell well.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4264-0
00:25:10.454 --> 00:25:13.004
So obviously you want to be a
little more careful, right?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4267-0
00:25:13.074 --> 00:25:13.454
Is it not?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4277-0
00:25:16.204 --> 00:25:17.434
Are you sure? Yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4278-0
00:25:17.614 --> 00:25:18.054
OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4330-0
00:25:18.124 --> 00:25:21.846
So are we In Sync so the IT is
nothing stopping you saying that

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4330-1
00:25:21.846 --> 00:25:25.510
you can use only this method or
that method, but obviously you

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4314-0
00:25:24.544 --> 00:25:25.164
Yeah, yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4330-2
00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:29.174
have to do more diligence with
the data with the when you need

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4330-3
00:25:29.174 --> 00:25:30.744
to take a bigger decisions.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4345-0
00:25:31.314 --> 00:25:35.604
But you are when you are playing
it in your own on machine.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4353-0
00:25:35.614 --> 00:25:36.994
So you can try out various
things.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4356-0
00:25:38.044 --> 00:25:38.354
Focus.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4392-0
00:25:39.794 --> 00:25:44.180
Said one question regarding the
regarding bigger, the lazy

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4373-0
00:25:41.244 --> 00:25:42.884
Yeah, another question, right.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4392-1
00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:46.484
approach, isn't it beating the?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4390-0
00:25:45.614 --> 00:25:47.634
That you need to come closer to
the machine.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4401-0
00:25:47.644 --> 00:25:49.794
Yeah, it closer to your laptop.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4412-0
00:25:49.854 --> 00:25:51.124
Your voice is coming low.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4423-0
00:25:50.764 --> 00:25:53.524
But that can you hear me now
said well.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4427-0
00:25:53.704 --> 00:25:54.854
Yes, yes, I can hear you.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4434-0
00:25:54.864 --> 00:25:56.914
But it is better if you come
closer.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4444-0
00:25:56.924 --> 00:25:58.604
Yeah, like and speak a little
louder.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4445-0
00:25:58.134 --> 00:26:00.134
Right, right.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4460-0
00:26:00.144 --> 00:26:03.314
So regarding the lazy approach,
isn't it beating the purpose?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4459-0
00:26:02.534 --> 00:26:02.674
Yes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4465-0
00:26:04.364 --> 00:26:04.634
Yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4484-0
00:26:04.644 --> 00:26:09.204
Because and that we are doing
building up a model with with

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4484-1
00:26:09.204 --> 00:26:11.484
the test data already in mind.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4505-0
00:26:11.494 --> 00:26:14.414
So it is not really a new data
that the model is.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4517-0
00:26:14.004 --> 00:26:16.584
No, no, Mr Mr Santosh, let me
clarify.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4520-0
00:26:14.424 --> 00:26:15.284
We are testing against.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4526-0
00:26:16.594 --> 00:26:18.174
You have not built really a
model.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4531-0
00:26:18.374 --> 00:26:20.014
OK, so So what?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4544-0
00:26:20.024 --> 00:26:23.074
What you did is that you kept
both of them.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4554-0
00:26:23.124 --> 00:26:25.034
You have an algorithm to be
used.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4573-0
00:26:25.464 --> 00:26:28.763
That algorithm is for example,
you identify the nearest

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4573-1
00:26:28.763 --> 00:26:31.414
neighbor and based on that you
will proceed.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4594-0
00:26:31.424 --> 00:26:35.006
So that can maybe an approach,
so you won't say that you

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4594-1
00:26:35.006 --> 00:26:36.954
already have a pre built model.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4598-0
00:26:37.284 --> 00:26:38.604
Mr Santosh Arvind In Sync.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4605-0
00:26:41.204 --> 00:26:44.594
And but in no.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4662-0
00:26:44.604 --> 00:26:48.946
So I mean still little unclear
because what I was thinking was

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4662-1
00:26:48.946 --> 00:26:53.288
that OK, the machine is trying
to build a model and this model

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4634-0
00:26:51.194 --> 00:26:51.314
Yes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4662-2
00:26:53.288 --> 00:26:57.422
the the performance of this
model will depend upon how well

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4662-3
00:26:57.422 --> 00:26:59.834
it process the unseen data,
right.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4663-0
00:27:00.264 --> 00:27:00.864
See.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4679-0
00:27:00.874 --> 00:27:04.032
That is general purpose of the
classification, so that is what

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4679-1
00:27:04.032 --> 00:27:04.934
the classifier is.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4685-0
00:27:05.344 --> 00:27:06.324
But then what?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4698-0
00:27:06.334 --> 00:27:09.934
The lazy classifier does is that
it is going to.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4756-0
00:27:09.944 --> 00:27:13.641
It is not going to build a
general model, so when you give

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4756-1
00:27:13.641 --> 00:27:17.714
a test tuple, it is going to do
something, some mental solution,

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4756-2
00:27:17.714 --> 00:27:21.474
which is, you may say modeling
which is saying that, OK, if

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4756-3
00:27:21.474 --> 00:27:25.359
these two people have the same
age then they are likely to be

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4756-4
00:27:25.359 --> 00:27:26.674
doing the same thing.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4780-0
00:27:26.904 --> 00:27:30.177
But then it is not going to
create a model that represents

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4780-1
00:27:30.177 --> 00:27:31.564
the entire training data.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4794-0
00:27:32.284 --> 00:27:38.106
It uses only a hypothesis space,
which is the most relevant for

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4794-1
00:27:38.106 --> 00:27:38.924
the test.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4797-0
00:27:38.934 --> 00:27:39.174
Tubes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4801-0
00:27:39.964 --> 00:27:40.694
Are we?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4805-0
00:27:40.884 --> 00:27:42.304
Is that does that help?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4820-0
00:27:44.494 --> 00:27:46.324
And OK, I take that point for
now.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4832-0
00:27:46.334 --> 00:27:49.064
Maybe it will get clarified as
you go for WhatsApp.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4841-0
00:27:49.074 --> 00:27:49.434
Thank you.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4836-0
00:27:49.534 --> 00:27:50.084
Yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4855-0
00:27:50.094 --> 00:27:53.713
Yeah, see the IT is actually we
won't spend much more time on

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4855-1
00:27:53.713 --> 00:27:54.004
that.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4857-0
00:27:54.074 --> 00:27:55.724
The lazy classifiers?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4908-0
00:27:55.974 --> 00:28:00.141
The lazy classifiers do not do
much task until they see the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4908-1
00:28:00.141 --> 00:28:04.655
data, but but the the advantage
is that they do entire work only

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4908-2
00:28:04.655 --> 00:28:09.168
after seeing the test tuple, so
they are not looking to create a

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4908-3
00:28:09.168 --> 00:28:12.154
generic model that applies to
whole world.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4950-0
00:28:12.654 --> 00:28:15.625
They will build a simple model
that applies only to the test

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4950-1
00:28:15.625 --> 00:28:18.548
tuple and they solve the problem
and forget the model began

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4950-2
00:28:18.548 --> 00:28:21.616
because next test to you comes,
they are going to rework again

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4950-3
00:28:21.616 --> 00:28:22.444
everything again.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/4970-0
00:28:24.474 --> 00:28:25.544
So to do that.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5028-0
00:28:24.584 --> 00:28:28.918
So we so we call something as a
model when generally for example

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5028-1
00:28:28.918 --> 00:28:33.051
decision tree or even neural
networks neural networks because

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5028-2
00:28:33.051 --> 00:28:36.718
training a neural network can
take even months because

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5028-3
00:28:36.718 --> 00:28:40.784
depending on that type of data,
for example training a large

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5028-4
00:28:40.784 --> 00:28:44.651
language model is something
which can take very long time

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5028-5
00:28:44.651 --> 00:28:47.784
for them, even with the most
powerful machine.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5068-0
00:28:48.144 --> 00:28:52.440
And so so in such cases, it is
clearly they're not lazy because

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5068-1
00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:56.669
if they say that every time you
ask a question, it is going to

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5068-2
00:28:56.669 --> 00:28:59.824
build the model, then it is not
going to work.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5095-0
00:29:01.724 --> 00:29:03.394
So can you give a real life
example?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5092-0
00:29:02.084 --> 00:29:04.114
So we have 3 drink everything.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5113-0
00:29:04.324 --> 00:29:08.312
They have to train everything
and then give it so that the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5113-1
00:29:08.312 --> 00:29:09.934
response is deadly fast.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5122-0
00:29:09.944 --> 00:29:11.534
I mean, it is like lightning
fast.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5137-0
00:29:11.584 --> 00:29:13.424
OK, Miss Surabhi, please ask the
question.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5131-0
00:29:13.554 --> 00:29:13.884
Yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5154-0
00:29:13.894 --> 00:29:18.544
Can you give a real life example
that any scenario? Ohh.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5151-0
00:29:18.624 --> 00:29:19.244
Cookie.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5216-0
00:29:19.314 --> 00:29:24.370
OK, so for example, let us take
the same customer data, OK, so

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5216-1
00:29:24.370 --> 00:29:29.427
the customer data, what we have
is that we have all the people

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5216-2
00:29:29.427 --> 00:29:34.242
who are buying the gadget and
now now what we are saying is

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5216-3
00:29:34.242 --> 00:29:38.816
that there are there are cases
for example the there are

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5216-4
00:29:38.816 --> 00:29:41.304
examples all over the place in.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5223-0
00:29:41.354 --> 00:29:43.204
Let me draw it in two
dimensional space.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5225-0
00:29:46.154 --> 00:29:46.554
Me.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5238-0
00:29:51.424 --> 00:29:54.884
I'm going to put positive and
negative, OK, positive for.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5241-0
00:30:03.484 --> 00:30:03.994
OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5248-0
00:30:04.064 --> 00:30:05.784
And let me put some negative
examples.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5281-0
00:30:08.734 --> 00:30:12.634
This is A2 dimensional data I'm
talking about that OK and now

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5281-1
00:30:12.634 --> 00:30:16.470
what I will do is that I will
not bother to build a model on

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5281-2
00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:16.784
this.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5301-0
00:30:16.894 --> 00:30:19.994
Suppose I get a new tuple which
I'm going to put it in blue

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5301-1
00:30:19.994 --> 00:30:20.304
color.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5313-0
00:30:20.674 --> 00:30:23.954
So I'm I got sunk tuple which is
somewhere here.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5362-0
00:30:24.764 --> 00:30:29.366
So what I will do is instead of
instead of looking at entire

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5362-1
00:30:29.366 --> 00:30:34.194
data, I'm going to check what is
the, what is the nearby tuples

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5362-2
00:30:34.194 --> 00:30:39.097
nearby tuples are this this this
so I will take these three only

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5362-3
00:30:39.097 --> 00:30:42.114
and start building a model
saying that.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5374-0
00:30:42.124 --> 00:30:44.234
OK, so now what can I conclude?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5386-0
00:30:44.244 --> 00:30:47.394
Based on this, Missouri is that
fine.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5432-0
00:30:48.214 --> 00:30:51.718
This attribute can be
inconvenienced and all kinds of

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5401-0
00:30:48.744 --> 00:30:49.564
OK, it means.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5432-1
00:30:51.718 --> 00:30:53.534
things, so don't don't. Umm.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5411-0
00:30:51.794 --> 00:30:53.204
It means it.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5422-0
00:30:53.374 --> 00:30:57.764
It means we are labeling here
with these attributes, right?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5454-0
00:30:57.934 --> 00:31:03.538
That whatever the three you have
sown, is it the same or I'm

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5442-0
00:31:02.634 --> 00:31:03.094
Yes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5469-0
00:31:03.154 --> 00:31:06.460
So based on that we we are
labeling, yes, we are labeling

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5454-1
00:31:03.538 --> 00:31:04.364
going at?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5469-1
00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:09.994
based on the whatever are the
most relevant part of the data.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5477-0
00:31:10.644 --> 00:31:12.054
So this is A2 dimensional.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5496-0
00:31:12.064 --> 00:31:14.825
Simple, very simplified example,
but in 10 dimensional space also

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5496-1
00:31:14.825 --> 00:31:15.954
still we'll do the similar.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5499-0
00:31:18.924 --> 00:31:19.294
OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5502-0
00:31:19.684 --> 00:31:20.064
Thank you.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5522-0
00:31:21.854 --> 00:31:27.544
OK, So what we will proceed is
that so here are some examples

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5522-1
00:31:27.544 --> 00:31:29.104
of lazy learners.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5541-0
00:31:29.374 --> 00:31:33.640
So very popular one is a K
nearest neighbor and similarly

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5541-1
00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:34.964
it can be weights.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5572-0
00:31:35.094 --> 00:31:38.741
So instead of taking all the
neighbors with equal weight, you

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5572-1
00:31:38.741 --> 00:31:41.916
can use the some weightage and
then do a based on the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5572-2
00:31:41.916 --> 00:31:42.504
weightage.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5623-0
00:31:42.514 --> 00:31:47.353
You can do the regression and
that can be one and then you can

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5623-1
00:31:47.353 --> 00:31:51.269
also do a symbolic
representation and this is a AI

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5623-2
00:31:51.269 --> 00:31:55.647
technique where you do a
reasoning based by representing

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5623-3
00:31:55.647 --> 00:32:00.178
the entire knowledge in symbolic
way and start putting the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5623-4
00:32:00.178 --> 00:32:02.174
conclusions based on that.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5655-0
00:32:02.864 --> 00:32:08.338
So that again you can do based
on the data that that you have

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5655-1
00:32:08.338 --> 00:32:14.076
got the test sample and the the
knowledge that is available from

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5655-2
00:32:14.076 --> 00:32:16.194
the already in the data.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5681-0
00:32:16.584 --> 00:32:21.978
So all of them are representing
the the approaches, which is you

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5681-1
00:32:21.978 --> 00:32:26.874
go based on the instance not
based on the entire data set.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5686-0
00:32:29.884 --> 00:32:30.294
OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5695-0
00:32:30.354 --> 00:32:33.974
So that is that is about the
lazy classifiers.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5704-0
00:32:33.984 --> 00:32:35.934
Now let us look at a decision
tree.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5716-0
00:32:36.384 --> 00:32:39.654
So for the decision tree, this
is a eager classifier.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5723-0
00:32:39.664 --> 00:32:41.544
OK, this is a eager classifier.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5733-0
00:32:46.614 --> 00:32:49.204
So let us explain the problem.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5747-0
00:32:49.304 --> 00:32:53.664
This problem is taken from that
T1's book.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5769-0
00:32:53.724 --> 00:32:59.438
I think the he he seems to us
slightly changed the problem but

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5769-1
00:32:59.438 --> 00:33:01.524
then it is good enough.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5814-0
00:33:01.534 --> 00:33:07.272
It is from the so so the way it
works is that suppose that we

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5814-1
00:33:07.272 --> 00:33:12.824
have the tax authorities, So
what is the purpose of the tax

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5814-2
00:33:12.824 --> 00:33:13.934
authorities?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5823-0
00:33:13.944 --> 00:33:17.131
So they have to make sure that
all citizens play pay tax, so

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5823-1
00:33:17.131 --> 00:33:19.534
that is the that is the
performance criteria.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5871-0
00:33:19.984 --> 00:33:24.113
So so it is not an easy job
because we have 101.5 billion

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5871-1
00:33:24.113 --> 00:33:28.385
people and the tax authorities
need to collect the alright,

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5871-2
00:33:28.385 --> 00:33:32.656
make sure that everybody who has
got a taxable income, it's

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5871-3
00:33:32.656 --> 00:33:33.724
paying the tax.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5904-0
00:33:34.194 --> 00:33:38.947
So now the question is that it
is possible that they receive so

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5904-1
00:33:38.947 --> 00:33:43.477
many millions 100 million tax
returns or even more than that

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5904-2
00:33:43.477 --> 00:33:44.294
every year.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5922-0
00:33:45.174 --> 00:33:48.945
So now the question is that how
do they know that the tax the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5922-1
00:33:48.945 --> 00:33:50.344
tax return is accurate?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5938-0
00:33:51.964 --> 00:33:55.844
So it is possible that they can
do a they can do auditing.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5953-0
00:33:56.274 --> 00:33:59.614
So auditing not an easy job
because it requires a lot of

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5953-1
00:33:59.614 --> 00:34:00.024
effort.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5972-0
00:34:00.034 --> 00:34:06.580
For example, the persons KYC is
date or other information is

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5972-1
00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:07.224
there.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5983-0
00:34:07.234 --> 00:34:10.495
So they need to go and check all
the transactions that have

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/5983-1
00:34:10.495 --> 00:34:10.984
happened.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6044-0
00:34:11.334 --> 00:34:14.853
For example, they need to go to
all the bank accounts that the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6044-1
00:34:14.853 --> 00:34:18.315
taxpayer has to check whether
what the person is representing

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6044-2
00:34:18.315 --> 00:34:21.666
as the income and what the bank
account shows is seeing and

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6044-3
00:34:21.666 --> 00:34:25.129
added to that they may have to
look at many other things like

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6044-4
00:34:25.129 --> 00:34:27.474
transactions and high value
transactions.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6055-0
00:34:27.484 --> 00:34:31.974
Credit cards then assets and it
is not an easy job.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6072-0
00:34:32.164 --> 00:34:35.341
And so you know that they do the
IT rights really on very rich

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6072-1
00:34:35.341 --> 00:34:35.694
people.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6106-0
00:34:35.704 --> 00:34:40.040
It is not even feasible for them
to check somebody's salary is

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6106-1
00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:43.824
9,00,000 or and then that person
reports an 8.5 lakhs.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6114-0
00:34:44.304 --> 00:34:45.894
Rather, they would not do a
write.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6128-0
00:34:45.904 --> 00:34:50.225
Rather, they would like to
somehow decide somehow, find a

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6128-1
00:34:50.225 --> 00:34:51.864
way to get the income.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6134-0
00:34:52.034 --> 00:34:53.764
Alright, that is a reasonable.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6143-0
00:34:53.774 --> 00:34:56.044
I mean the appropriate tags from
that person.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6156-0
00:34:56.494 --> 00:35:00.234
So now the point is the problem
is like this.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6164-0
00:35:00.494 --> 00:35:03.004
So they get they.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6201-0
00:35:03.014 --> 00:35:06.410
They will not have a million
staff members, so because to

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6201-1
00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:10.157
raid and ought to do a thorough
audit on each individual, where

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6201-2
00:35:10.157 --> 00:35:13.788
essentially they need to go dig
through so much of data about

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6201-3
00:35:13.788 --> 00:35:14.724
each individual.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6235-0
00:35:14.734 --> 00:35:17.679
So what is the what are the
properties and what are the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6235-1
00:35:17.679 --> 00:35:20.940
wealth and what are the family
members and what is the family

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6235-2
00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:23.884
members, wealth and all that
that they need to collect?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6246-0
00:35:23.984 --> 00:35:26.134
And then what are the sources
for each one of them?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6252-0
00:35:26.184 --> 00:35:27.274
So they can't do it.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6286-0
00:35:27.584 --> 00:35:32.060
So what they what they do is
that they so now so they they

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6286-1
00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:36.915
have do not have the ability to
audit every tax return that way

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6286-2
00:35:36.915 --> 00:35:37.294
fine.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6299-0
00:35:37.664 --> 00:35:41.381
So they need to intelligently
pick the tax returns that need

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6299-1
00:35:41.381 --> 00:35:42.234
to be audited.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6307-0
00:35:43.444 --> 00:35:45.154
So what can be the basis?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6332-0
00:35:45.164 --> 00:35:49.357
Because the tax authorities have
been working for 100 years, so

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6332-1
00:35:49.357 --> 00:35:53.090
they have already seen millions
and possibly billion tax

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6332-2
00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:53.614
returns.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6354-0
00:35:54.004 --> 00:35:57.337
And it is possible that millions
of them have been audited, and

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6354-1
00:35:57.337 --> 00:35:59.264
they also know the results of
audit.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6367-0
00:35:59.724 --> 00:36:03.534
So what they can do is that they
have entire data.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6390-0
00:36:03.804 --> 00:36:08.625
So what is the data of the
taxpayer and what is the result

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6390-1
00:36:08.625 --> 00:36:10.014
of the tax audit?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6450-0
00:36:10.604 --> 00:36:14.608
So based on that, what they can
do is that they can take the new

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6450-1
00:36:14.608 --> 00:36:18.489
tax returns that they receive,
they run them through, run them

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6450-2
00:36:18.489 --> 00:36:22.062
through the model and then they
identify what are the tax

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6450-3
00:36:22.062 --> 00:36:25.881
returns, which are potentially
there is an underpayment or we

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6450-4
00:36:25.881 --> 00:36:27.544
call this class as a cheat.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6477-0
00:36:27.614 --> 00:36:30.462
Cheat is that the person has
under reported the income so

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6477-1
00:36:30.462 --> 00:36:33.114
paid less tax than the person
should be paying to the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6477-2
00:36:33.114 --> 00:36:33.654
government.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6586-0
00:36:34.574 --> 00:36:39.375
So now now this is acting as a
training data and then we have

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6586-1
00:36:39.375 --> 00:36:44.099
taken only toy set up for data
so that income tax return may

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6586-2
00:36:44.099 --> 00:36:48.977
have 100 indicators but we are
taking some simple 3 indicators

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6586-3
00:36:48.977 --> 00:36:53.546
and based on that to be have
also the class labels we have

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6586-4
00:36:53.546 --> 00:36:58.579
only the income test authorities
may have million records but we

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6586-5
00:36:58.579 --> 00:37:03.070
have taken a test to sample of
10 records and then we are

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6586-6
00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:07.407
seeing that can we build a
decision tree that will help

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6586-7
00:37:07.407 --> 00:37:12.517
them in predicting for a new tax
return should they audit or they

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6586-8
00:37:12.517 --> 00:37:13.214
need not.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6600-0
00:37:21.084 --> 00:37:25.234
I hope the problem and the
approach both are clear.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6623-0
00:37:25.324 --> 00:37:29.187
So now, given this training
data, so we already know the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6623-1
00:37:29.187 --> 00:37:32.574
class label, so we can build
this decision trees.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6628-0
00:37:32.584 --> 00:37:33.334
How to build it?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6645-0
00:37:33.344 --> 00:37:36.374
We'll come to that short while
we'll come a little later.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6679-0
00:37:36.384 --> 00:37:39.351
How to build the tree and then
after that one of you even

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6679-1
00:37:39.351 --> 00:37:42.317
wanted to know how to measure
the accuracy that will come

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6679-2
00:37:42.317 --> 00:37:43.544
after we do all of that.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6689-0
00:37:43.764 --> 00:37:46.264
OK, so now let us see.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6711-0
00:37:46.304 --> 00:37:50.520
Somehow we built the tree, so
now we can see that this tree is

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6711-1
00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:50.854
good.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6715-0
00:37:50.864 --> 00:37:53.344
Well, representing the training
data well.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6726-0
00:37:53.514 --> 00:37:55.724
For example, let us take the 5th
tuple.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6755-0
00:37:56.114 --> 00:38:00.963
Refund is no refund is no and
then marital status is D so

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6755-1
00:38:00.963 --> 00:38:05.394
diverse, so it is on the left
tuple so refund is no.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6798-0
00:38:05.634 --> 00:38:10.190
So let us trace the trace the
5th tuple, so it is going this

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6798-1
00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:14.671
path, then it is going this path
and then after the 5th 5th

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6798-2
00:38:14.671 --> 00:38:17.434
people 95K so it is going this
path.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6805-0
00:38:18.194 --> 00:38:20.194
So we see that it is, yes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6827-0
00:38:20.314 --> 00:38:23.736
So the person is under reporting
the income, so this is the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6827-1
00:38:23.736 --> 00:38:25.674
person has not paid the full
tax.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6843-0
00:38:26.864 --> 00:38:32.374
So similarly, we can take uh the
9th one so refund is new.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6848-0
00:38:32.424 --> 00:38:34.064
Again, let me use another color.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6859-0
00:38:37.604 --> 00:38:38.904
This is for the 9th tuple.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6866-0
00:38:38.914 --> 00:38:39.654
Refund is no.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6877-0
00:38:40.184 --> 00:38:46.744
Then marital status is married
and then the class label is new.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6915-0
00:38:46.814 --> 00:38:51.027
So this is the class label so we
can see that this tree you can

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6915-1
00:38:51.027 --> 00:38:54.976
you can take your room time
later and you can see that this

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6915-2
00:38:54.976 --> 00:38:57.674
tree truly represents the
training data.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6931-0
00:38:59.354 --> 00:39:04.184
But the problem is that we can
build another tree that also

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6931-1
00:39:04.184 --> 00:39:07.484
represents the training data
faithfully.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6974-0
00:39:07.814 --> 00:39:11.644
So this is a different tree, but
this also represents the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/6974-1
00:39:11.644 --> 00:39:13.294
training data faithfully.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7017-0
00:39:14.584 --> 00:39:18.745
And so now of course, we so
essentially we are complicating

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7017-1
00:39:18.745 --> 00:39:23.184
the problem saying that how do
we pick the correct tree so that

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7017-2
00:39:23.184 --> 00:39:27.414
we are going to see a little
later, how do we pick the right

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7017-3
00:39:27.414 --> 00:39:31.645
tree when multiple trees are
possible and then we are saying

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7017-4
00:39:31.645 --> 00:39:36.014
that once the tree is there once
the tree is done then we have

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7017-5
00:39:36.014 --> 00:39:37.054
the test tuple.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7031-0
00:39:38.284 --> 00:39:43.219
We have the test data right, so
test data is refund is equal to

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7031-1
00:39:43.219 --> 00:39:43.604
noon.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7044-0
00:39:43.694 --> 00:39:48.574
So test data we are going to
trace then status is married.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7053-0
00:39:50.454 --> 00:39:52.564
So we know that it should be no.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7070-0
00:39:59.684 --> 00:40:03.365
So this is this is the same
picture that we had seen little

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7070-1
00:40:03.365 --> 00:40:03.794
longer.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7086-0
00:40:03.964 --> 00:40:08.104
So this is all the decision tree
is supposed to be doing.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7100-0
00:40:09.014 --> 00:40:12.309
So take the data, do the
induction of the tree, and then

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7100-1
00:40:12.309 --> 00:40:12.944
apply them.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7121-0
00:40:14.524 --> 00:40:20.122
So now the question that we will
be interested in when we build a

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7121-1
00:40:20.122 --> 00:40:21.054
classifier.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7136-0
00:40:21.634 --> 00:40:26.944
So when we build a classifier,
we want the accuracy to be high.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7174-0
00:40:28.254 --> 00:40:33.006
We want this to be high and then
we want the speed to be good so

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7174-1
00:40:33.006 --> 00:40:37.465
that it is going to give the
response hopefully in real time

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7174-2
00:40:37.465 --> 00:40:39.584
then we want it to be robust.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7180-0
00:40:40.774 --> 00:40:41.904
So it is.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7199-0
00:40:41.974 --> 00:40:47.611
It is robustness as a mini many
points we can see, but then data

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7199-1
00:40:47.611 --> 00:40:48.564
may not be.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7202-0
00:40:52.464 --> 00:40:53.074
Me.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7205-0
00:40:53.084 --> 00:40:54.084
Have issues.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7210-0
00:40:59.774 --> 00:41:00.444
So.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7265-0
00:41:00.514 --> 00:41:04.194
So The thing is that you can
never be sure that with the the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7265-1
00:41:04.194 --> 00:41:07.873
data, because it is impossible
for you to go to the point of

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7265-2
00:41:07.873 --> 00:41:11.492
the source of the data and
verify it so many times you deal

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7265-3
00:41:11.492 --> 00:41:15.292
with the data which runs into
hundred thousands or millions of

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7265-4
00:41:15.292 --> 00:41:15.774
records.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7298-0
00:41:15.784 --> 00:41:19.413
So you cannot think of going to
the source to verify each one,

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7298-1
00:41:19.413 --> 00:41:23.157
so you can have a healthy doubt
about the data saying that it is

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7298-2
00:41:23.157 --> 00:41:24.884
possible that some attributes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7306-0
00:41:26.224 --> 00:41:28.374
Maybe may not be accurate.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7343-0
00:41:28.384 --> 00:41:32.335
For example, sometimes the
people simply collect the data

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7343-1
00:41:32.335 --> 00:41:36.762
from the walkers in the shopping
malls, so you can know that the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7343-2
00:41:36.762 --> 00:41:39.214
people who are collecting the
data.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7369-0
00:41:39.224 --> 00:41:42.934
There is no way even it right at
the time of the collection to be

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7369-1
00:41:42.934 --> 00:41:46.194
sure that whether the data is
right or wrong or anything.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7387-0
00:41:46.624 --> 00:41:50.914
So at most they can verify few
things like what is the.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7404-0
00:41:52.004 --> 00:41:55.184
At most I I I don't know what
they can verify whether the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7404-1
00:41:55.184 --> 00:41:56.444
person is young or old.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7411-0
00:41:56.454 --> 00:41:57.864
Maybe I even that I don't know.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7437-0
00:41:58.334 --> 00:42:03.034
So the point is you you may have
the data may have issues, but in

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7437-1
00:42:03.034 --> 00:42:06.024
spite of that the model should
work with.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7458-0
00:42:06.034 --> 00:42:09.928
So now really the question that
you will ask is that if the data

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7458-1
00:42:09.928 --> 00:42:12.384
has issues, how can the model
work well?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7468-0
00:42:14.544 --> 00:42:15.904
Maybe somebody wants to give a
try.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7481-0
00:42:17.224 --> 00:42:21.892
The data may have issues, but
does the can the model work

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7481-1
00:42:21.892 --> 00:42:22.294
well?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7489-0
00:42:24.544 --> 00:42:26.054
We can put some dummy data.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7495-0
00:42:27.724 --> 00:42:28.514
Ah, no.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7499-0
00:42:28.524 --> 00:42:29.134
No, no, no.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7523-0
00:42:29.144 --> 00:42:32.694
Dummy data is actually actually
you are imagining many things

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7523-1
00:42:32.694 --> 00:42:35.957
because the dummy data is
representing something of your

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7523-2
00:42:35.957 --> 00:42:37.044
imagination. Right?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7527-0
00:42:37.964 --> 00:42:38.714
So.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7533-0
00:42:38.764 --> 00:42:40.224
So the point is that.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7539-0
00:42:40.984 --> 00:42:42.594
So let us do one thing.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7551-0
00:42:42.864 --> 00:42:45.474
Let us be clear about one thing,
one step back.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7559-0
00:42:45.864 --> 00:42:48.874
Suppose that the data is pure
garbage.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7579-0
00:42:49.324 --> 00:42:52.687
Then we can be sure that garbage
in, garbage out, so the model

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7579-1
00:42:52.687 --> 00:42:53.914
will also be a garbage.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7587-0
00:42:53.924 --> 00:42:55.504
So there is no doubt about that.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7596-0
00:42:56.284 --> 00:42:59.954
But then suppose that the data
has problems.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7631-0
00:43:00.004 --> 00:43:04.064
Suppose that that some some
elements are missing and it is

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7631-1
00:43:04.064 --> 00:43:08.261
possible that some elements are
inaccurate and some elements

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7631-2
00:43:08.261 --> 00:43:11.494
there is a noisy instrumentation
that is used.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7649-0
00:43:11.504 --> 00:43:14.788
So the error there can be 10%
variation in what you are

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7649-1
00:43:14.788 --> 00:43:15.374
observing.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7672-0
00:43:15.644 --> 00:43:21.303
So in spite of all that, you may
be able to build a good model,

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7672-1
00:43:21.303 --> 00:43:24.574
even though some data is
suspicious.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7689-0
00:43:24.584 --> 00:43:27.584
So that is what is we want our
model to be capable.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7721-0
00:43:28.394 --> 00:43:33.018
So even though some small part
of the data will have the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7696-0
00:43:28.964 --> 00:43:29.344
Is there?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7721-1
00:43:33.018 --> 00:43:37.965
problem, it should not be big
distorted because of the small

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7721-2
00:43:37.965 --> 00:43:39.344
part of the data.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7732-0
00:43:39.354 --> 00:43:40.314
Missouri, please speak.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7726-0
00:43:40.754 --> 00:43:41.164
Yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7742-0
00:43:41.174 --> 00:43:44.544
So is it related with something
like that we can do that?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7751-0
00:43:44.554 --> 00:43:46.684
Me nor is standard deviation
something.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7770-0
00:43:47.734 --> 00:43:50.304
We can do like this to.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7765-0
00:43:49.374 --> 00:43:50.354
No, no. See me.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7784-0
00:43:50.394 --> 00:43:53.823
See me surbhi standard deviation
applies to only when you have

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7784-1
00:43:53.823 --> 00:43:54.584
one attribute.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7807-0
00:43:54.914 --> 00:43:57.779
When you build a classifier, you
are saying that you have large

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7807-1
00:43:57.779 --> 00:44:00.464
number of attributes and you
want to predict a class label.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7852-0
00:44:01.004 --> 00:44:05.867
So, so standard deviation may
not be appropriate, but what we

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7852-1
00:44:05.867 --> 00:44:10.808
are saying is that in the data,
for example for, let us let us

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7852-2
00:44:10.808 --> 00:44:15.357
look go back to the let us go
back to the problem that we

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7852-3
00:44:15.357 --> 00:44:17.474
talked about sometime back.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7869-0
00:44:19.414 --> 00:44:25.731
So so now we are saying that the
people with the I, I hope you

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7869-1
00:44:25.731 --> 00:44:27.134
remember this.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7878-0
00:44:27.184 --> 00:44:30.544
So I'm just writing that, so the
income.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7883-0
00:44:32.144 --> 00:44:33.394
And the vehicle.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7898-0
00:44:33.664 --> 00:44:37.914
So I'm again creating a simple
data set so that it is clear.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7962-0
00:44:38.004 --> 00:44:44.190
Suppose that income in a key
thousands of rupees, so somebody

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7962-1
00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:50.076
has an income of 20 and the
person is riding motorcycle 25

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7962-2
00:44:50.076 --> 00:44:54.965
riding a car 30 riding a
motorcycle, 35 riding a

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7962-3
00:44:54.965 --> 00:45:01.350
motorcycle, 45 riding a car, 50
riding a motorcycle, 70 writing

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7962-4
00:45:01.350 --> 00:45:03.944
a car and 65 riding a car.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7981-0
00:45:04.334 --> 00:45:09.178
So now the point is that this
data has some problems because

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7981-1
00:45:09.178 --> 00:45:10.924
we see it is possible.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/7990-0
00:45:11.014 --> 00:45:12.524
So we do not know really.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8003-0
00:45:12.534 --> 00:45:15.251
The point is that we cannot go
to the source and verify

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8003-1
00:45:15.251 --> 00:45:15.784
everything.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8015-0
00:45:15.874 --> 00:45:18.404
It is possible that there may be
more factors.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8042-0
00:45:18.484 --> 00:45:22.967
There may be more factors, which
is which our data is not able to

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8042-1
00:45:22.967 --> 00:45:26.974
capture because of which some
records are not as expected.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8080-0
00:45:27.424 --> 00:45:33.276
But if we provide for some
tolerance, then we can say that

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8080-1
00:45:33.276 --> 00:45:38.929
this can be greater than 40
implies that the person will

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8080-2
00:45:38.929 --> 00:45:44.383
have car and less than 40
implies the person will have

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8080-3
00:45:44.383 --> 00:45:45.474
motorcycle.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8099-0
00:45:45.654 --> 00:45:49.158
So now what we are saying is
that it should have the ability

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8099-1
00:45:49.158 --> 00:45:49.904
to withstand.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8129-0
00:45:49.974 --> 00:45:53.204
So now you can say that there
are only 8 tuples, so you may

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8129-1
00:45:53.204 --> 00:45:56.164
say 2 tuples are already
creating problems, so 24% no.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8156-0
00:45:56.174 --> 00:45:59.074
But then I had to write the
problem to police here, but the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8156-1
00:45:59.074 --> 00:46:02.263
data you will get hopefully will
be thousands or 10s of thousands

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8156-2
00:46:02.263 --> 00:46:03.084
or even millions.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8174-0
00:46:03.904 --> 00:46:09.720
So so having few tuples problem
tuples should not deviate or

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8174-1
00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:12.294
distort the model and rest.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8199-0
00:46:12.344 --> 00:46:15.557
I hope you understand the
scalability is that it should be

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8199-1
00:46:15.557 --> 00:46:18.334
able to work with large datasets
interpretability.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8209-0
00:46:18.344 --> 00:46:22.764
In fact, this is referred as by
people as explainable AI.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8291-0
00:46:28.524 --> 00:46:33.523
So what we are saying is that we
should be able to understand,

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8291-1
00:46:33.523 --> 00:46:38.362
for example, given this model
given this model, uh, you will

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8291-2
00:46:38.362 --> 00:46:43.519
be able to interpret saying that
car is an expensive vehicle and

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8291-3
00:46:43.519 --> 00:46:48.279
motorcycle is relatively less
expensive and somebody has to

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8291-4
00:46:48.279 --> 00:46:53.198
have a car they need to budget
more money out of their pocket

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8291-5
00:46:53.198 --> 00:46:57.720
every month or and so for
motorcycles the budget has can

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8291-6
00:46:57.720 --> 00:46:58.434
be lower.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8301-0
00:46:58.604 --> 00:47:00.794
So you can make an
interpretation saying that.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8318-0
00:47:00.804 --> 00:47:05.152
OK, so I got a model that seems
to be going well with my own

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8318-1
00:47:05.152 --> 00:47:05.864
intuition.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8336-0
00:47:06.144 --> 00:47:10.727
So this is again very very
simple example, but then but

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8336-1
00:47:10.727 --> 00:47:13.264
then with the complex examples.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8358-0
00:47:13.274 --> 00:47:17.199
So you don't do it in 5 minutes,
you take months and possibly

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8358-1
00:47:17.199 --> 00:47:19.604
months to do that and
interpretation.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8381-0
00:47:19.614 --> 00:47:23.415
Also, people will be thinking
over it for days and months and

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8381-1
00:47:23.415 --> 00:47:27.154
years, months before they make a
decision with a conviction.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8391-0
00:47:34.004 --> 00:47:35.964
So I hope probably are In Sync.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8431-0
00:47:40.044 --> 00:47:44.202
Uh, so do we consider these as
parameters whenever we get to

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8431-1
00:47:44.202 --> 00:47:48.156
problem statement to get the
result like which classifier

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8431-2
00:47:48.156 --> 00:47:50.814
model best fits the problem
statement?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8433-0
00:47:52.134 --> 00:47:52.974
Ah, no, no.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8446-0
00:47:52.984 --> 00:47:57.984
Best classifier model is is not
considered as a parameter.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8465-0
00:47:58.754 --> 00:48:03.636
Uh, But then several of the
classifiers the required that

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8465-1
00:48:03.636 --> 00:48:05.824
you learn some parameters.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8474-0
00:48:06.374 --> 00:48:08.424
So for example, in neural
network, i.e.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8496-0
00:48:08.434 --> 00:48:11.615
Was telling that sometimes you
may have to learn large number

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8496-1
00:48:11.615 --> 00:48:14.384
of parameters before the neural
network can help you.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8525-0
00:48:15.014 --> 00:48:18.822
Similarly, when we are talking
about things like, let's say a

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8525-1
00:48:18.822 --> 00:48:22.383
logistic regression that we
didn't talk or support vector

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8525-2
00:48:22.383 --> 00:48:24.164
machine that we talked about.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8550-0
00:48:24.174 --> 00:48:28.531
So there will be parameters that
you need to learn before before

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8550-1
00:48:28.531 --> 00:48:31.816
you can duck parameters
represent the model, not

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8550-2
00:48:31.816 --> 00:48:32.754
anything else.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8553-0
00:48:33.674 --> 00:48:34.864
So is that good?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8558-0
00:48:39.714 --> 00:48:40.174
OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8564-0
00:48:40.114 --> 00:48:42.404
Uh, like, sorry, Sir.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8610-0
00:48:42.974 --> 00:48:46.933
Just to just trying to
understand like the problem

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8610-1
00:48:46.933 --> 00:48:51.668
statement which she, Kate and we
try to figure out like what

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8610-2
00:48:51.668 --> 00:48:56.248
would be the best fit to solve
that problem like to choose

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8610-3
00:48:56.248 --> 00:49:00.284
correct classifier model to get
to a solution sure.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8641-0
00:49:01.794 --> 00:49:05.424
So can we consider those
parameters in this slide as the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8641-1
00:49:05.424 --> 00:49:07.844
ratings for the classification
model?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8634-0
00:49:07.064 --> 00:49:07.524
Ohk.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8637-0
00:49:07.534 --> 00:49:08.414
OK. OK, OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8642-0
00:49:08.424 --> 00:49:08.894
OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8657-0
00:49:08.964 --> 00:49:12.477
So you are saying that the speed
and accuracy and robustness, can

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8657-1
00:49:12.477 --> 00:49:13.434
you consider them?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8705-0
00:49:13.504 --> 00:49:17.914
Yes, yes, you can consider them
evaluating which model to go,

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8668-0
00:49:14.034 --> 00:49:14.254
Yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8705-1
00:49:17.914 --> 00:49:22.040
because it is generally said
that the neural networks, in

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8705-2
00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:26.236
spite of taking long time to
train, they can withstand the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8705-3
00:49:26.236 --> 00:49:27.374
noise very well.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8719-0
00:49:27.444 --> 00:49:29.834
So that is what is talked about
neural networks.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8724-0
00:49:30.204 --> 00:49:32.694
And so that is true.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8743-0
00:49:32.744 --> 00:49:35.533
So that type of things that you
can consider, but the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8743-1
00:49:35.533 --> 00:49:38.064
interpretability of neural
networks is terrible.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8786-0
00:49:38.374 --> 00:49:42.378
So people generally cannot
explain why it works and why it

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8786-1
00:49:42.378 --> 00:49:46.517
does not work, but some of the
simpler models like rules and

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8786-2
00:49:46.517 --> 00:49:50.520
rules where people can very
easily explain what is it that

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8786-3
00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:52.284
they learn from that data.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8791-0
00:49:53.254 --> 00:49:54.464
So, so that is true.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8827-0
00:49:54.474 --> 00:49:58.389
So you can you can consider them
as some kind of indicators on

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8827-1
00:49:58.389 --> 00:50:02.117
what you should go with because
parameters are generally we

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8827-2
00:50:02.117 --> 00:50:05.224
consider it as like the equation
has a parameter.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8836-0
00:50:05.234 --> 00:50:08.384
So, for example, suppose that
you are drawing a line.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8854-0
00:50:10.664 --> 00:50:15.814
You are drawing a line which is
W1X1 plus W2X2 plus.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8856-0
00:50:16.154 --> 00:50:16.614
Yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8915-0
00:50:16.704 --> 00:50:21.811
Ohh W3X3 is equal to some EM so
then you say W1W 2W3 these are

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8915-1
00:50:21.811 --> 00:50:26.350
representing the parameters X1,
X, 2X3 are representing

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8915-2
00:50:26.350 --> 00:50:30.808
attributes so many times the
models that we learn will

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8915-3
00:50:30.808 --> 00:50:35.184
require these parameters to be
learned from the data.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8950-0
00:50:35.944 --> 00:50:39.855
So that is why I said I was
hesitant to say parameters, but

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8950-1
00:50:39.855 --> 00:50:43.962
then these are the attributes or
the OR the characteristics of

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8950-2
00:50:43.962 --> 00:50:46.634
the class various classifier
approaches.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8954-0
00:50:47.074 --> 00:50:48.034
So you can consider.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8985-0
00:50:51.304 --> 00:50:56.160
Alright, so now now let us look
at uh, how does how do we know

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8994-0
00:50:55.624 --> 00:51:01.264
Browser The The other one doubt
in the previous slide speed.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/8985-1
00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:57.084
whether yes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9005-0
00:51:01.274 --> 00:51:04.524
I just wanted to understand once
and very much, sorry.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9010-0
00:51:05.644 --> 00:51:07.344
Speed is something like this.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9036-0
00:51:07.354 --> 00:51:11.541
See that you are writing an
algorithm and you're giving it a

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9036-1
00:51:11.541 --> 00:51:14.424
data and and I hope you are
learning now.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9067-0
00:51:14.434 --> 00:51:18.374
Data structures and algorithms
you may have learned something

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9067-1
00:51:18.374 --> 00:51:22.251
called a time complexity, so
there are some algorithms which

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9055-0
00:51:20.004 --> 00:51:20.124
Yes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9067-2
00:51:22.251 --> 00:51:26.254
take which take exponential time
complexity when given a data.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9070-0
00:51:26.564 --> 00:51:27.674
So they are.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9101-0
00:51:27.724 --> 00:51:31.532
You cannot be sure that so with
the increase in data, whether

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9101-1
00:51:31.532 --> 00:51:34.910
they will even reach a
conclusion, miss Mr South of is

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9101-2
00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:35.524
that good?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9120-0
00:51:35.324 --> 00:51:37.824
Yes, yes, yes, that's correct,
yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9125-0
00:51:36.344 --> 00:51:39.730
So so that is that is what we
are saying when we talk about

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9125-1
00:51:39.730 --> 00:51:40.294
the speed.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9150-0
00:51:40.524 --> 00:51:45.283
So you will not even be able to
build a model in sometimes if

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9150-1
00:51:45.283 --> 00:51:49.044
the algorithm and the data set
are of that type.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9171-0
00:51:49.584 --> 00:51:53.470
So but again, you all have
another speed, which is that you

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9171-1
00:51:53.470 --> 00:51:55.154
want to predict the label.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9187-0
00:51:55.524 --> 00:51:59.534
So you give a test tuple and
then you predict the label.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9210-0
00:51:59.544 --> 00:52:02.314
So if you go for a lazy
classifier, it is going to take

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9210-1
00:52:02.314 --> 00:52:04.094
a lot of time to predict the
label.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9247-0
00:52:04.484 --> 00:52:08.435
But many times the neural
networks you take month to train

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9247-1
00:52:08.435 --> 00:52:12.721
it to learn billion parameters,
but after that you give you a a

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9247-2
00:52:12.721 --> 00:52:15.064
question or you give a test
tuple.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9257-0
00:52:15.394 --> 00:52:16.894
It will give you the response in
a flash.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9261-0
00:52:20.014 --> 00:52:20.494
Thank you, Sir.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9269-0
00:52:25.614 --> 00:52:27.164
Now let's look at.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9278-0
00:52:28.234 --> 00:52:30.444
This is again A2 class problem.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9285-0
00:52:30.494 --> 00:52:32.644
OK, two dimensional 2 class
problem.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9289-0
00:52:32.684 --> 00:52:33.934
OK, 2D data.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9296-0
00:52:36.454 --> 00:52:37.854
And we have two classes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9302-0
00:52:40.144 --> 00:52:40.664
What are they?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9313-0
00:52:40.674 --> 00:52:43.804
One is blue and other is red.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9339-0
00:52:45.194 --> 00:52:49.964
So now we can see that when we
look at this data, So what we

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9339-1
00:52:49.964 --> 00:52:53.404
can see is that there is clearly
a pattern.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9358-0
00:52:54.034 --> 00:53:01.460
There is clearly a pattern so so
the pattern is that when when

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9358-1
00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:03.464
this is. This is.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9385-0
00:53:04.434 --> 00:53:11.740
This is the blue is triangles,
so blue is represented by these

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9385-1
00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:18.814
two areas, right, and and then
this is representing the red.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9398-0
00:53:19.804 --> 00:53:24.494
So now now the problem is that
there are many.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9430-0
00:53:24.504 --> 00:53:30.260
So what you notice is that in
this case we are requiring

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9430-1
00:53:30.260 --> 00:53:35.914
really a transformation of the
data in order to get the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9430-2
00:53:35.914 --> 00:53:37.024
conclusion.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9445-0
00:53:37.034 --> 00:53:40.384
So we cannot do it comfortably
with X1 and X2.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9456-0
00:53:40.774 --> 00:53:42.864
We want to do it with X1 and X2.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9487-0
00:53:42.874 --> 00:53:46.468
We will have a lot of trouble,
but with X one squared and X2

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9487-1
00:53:46.468 --> 00:53:49.944
squared, we are more comfortable
because this is the data.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9507-0
00:53:49.954 --> 00:53:53.343
This is actually a very
synthetic data set that is

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9507-1
00:53:53.343 --> 00:53:56.864
created only for the sake of
explaining the problem.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9549-0
00:53:57.514 --> 00:54:01.539
So now the problem is that
suppose we want to create a

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9549-1
00:54:01.539 --> 00:54:06.076
decision tree and then we want
to solve this problem where we

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9549-2
00:54:06.076 --> 00:54:10.174
don't do the data transformation
but we take X1 and X2.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9585-0
00:54:10.384 --> 00:54:13.880
So what is going to happen is
that we need to create a

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9585-1
00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:17.693
decision tree with the large
number of nodes, because there

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9585-2
00:54:17.693 --> 00:54:19.854
is a large number of data
points.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9590-0
00:54:20.224 --> 00:54:21.894
So to help them.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9628-0
00:54:22.004 --> 00:54:26.813
So for example, you may require
one node to explain this one

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9628-1
00:54:26.813 --> 00:54:31.779
node to explain this and one so
you know many nodes to explain

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9628-2
00:54:31.779 --> 00:54:35.484
various well can various values
for X1 and X2.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9655-0
00:54:35.994 --> 00:54:40.078
So what will happen is that you
can get because and there are

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9655-1
00:54:40.078 --> 00:54:43.899
many border points, so many
border points are going to go

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9655-2
00:54:43.899 --> 00:54:44.294
wrong.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9692-0
00:54:45.074 --> 00:54:49.986
So in such case what happens is
that you need to create a very

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9692-1
00:54:49.986 --> 00:54:54.430
complex decision tree and when
you create a very complex

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9692-2
00:54:54.430 --> 00:54:59.264
decision tree with the training
set, the error rate can drop.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9722-0
00:55:01.064 --> 00:55:06.494
But you get a test set, then
once you create a very complex

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9722-1
00:55:06.494 --> 00:55:12.014
decision tree, then the error
may drop up to certain points.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9749-0
00:55:12.024 --> 00:55:17.164
For example, up to this point,
error is dropping for both test

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9749-1
00:55:17.164 --> 00:55:21.977
and training, but beyond this
point the test data error is

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9749-2
00:55:21.977 --> 00:55:22.874
increasing.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9769-0
00:55:22.884 --> 00:55:28.878
So that is that is just to just
to help you pick up what we

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9769-1
00:55:28.878 --> 00:55:32.074
discussed in the previous class.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9780-0
00:55:32.524 --> 00:55:36.464
So so this is when you have a
large number of.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9784-0
00:55:38.514 --> 00:55:39.494
Data points.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9788-0
00:55:40.594 --> 00:55:41.754
So.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9802-0
00:55:41.804 --> 00:55:46.068
So the point is, this is
something we talked about when

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9802-1
00:55:46.068 --> 00:55:47.514
the dimensionality.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9808-0
00:55:47.524 --> 00:55:49.734
So actually we talked about
dimensionality.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9815-0
00:55:49.744 --> 00:55:50.504
It is in.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9828-0
00:55:50.544 --> 00:55:53.249
In this case, dimensionality is
only two, but then

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9828-1
00:55:53.249 --> 00:55:55.264
characterization is a little
problem.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9846-0
00:55:56.204 --> 00:55:58.863
So what we are saying is that we
need to do a feature

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9846-1
00:55:58.863 --> 00:55:59.454
engineering.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9861-0
00:55:59.464 --> 00:56:01.814
So in this case we need to do a
data transformation.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9877-0
00:56:02.714 --> 00:56:06.338
So without data transformation
this is going to result in a

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9877-1
00:56:06.338 --> 00:56:07.364
loop performance.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9908-0
00:56:07.934 --> 00:56:13.206
So without data transformation,
we only focus on building the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9908-1
00:56:13.206 --> 00:56:18.478
decision tree, so more complex
decision tree means that there

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9908-2
00:56:18.478 --> 00:56:22.644
is a more errors with the
generalization errors.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9924-0
00:56:22.654 --> 00:56:27.124
So that is we want it to predict
for something which is not seen.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9930-0
00:56:27.554 --> 00:56:28.984
So there will be more errors.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9994-0
00:56:28.994 --> 00:56:33.303
This is a referred as a
phenomenon is referred as a

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9994-1
00:56:33.303 --> 00:56:38.606
overfitting, so that is saying
we are trying to depend too much

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9994-2
00:56:38.606 --> 00:56:43.412
on the decision tree or the
model we are trying to depend

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9994-3
00:56:43.412 --> 00:56:48.633
too much on the model because of
which because of which beyond

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9994-4
00:56:48.633 --> 00:56:53.439
certain point the error rate is
improving the rather than

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/9994-5
00:56:53.439 --> 00:56:54.184
reducing.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10014-0
00:56:54.374 --> 00:56:59.225
So this is a complex this is
actually you need to think in

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10014-1
00:56:59.225 --> 00:56:59.964
terms of.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10019-0
00:57:00.064 --> 00:57:01.454
This example is simple.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10098-0
00:57:01.464 --> 00:57:06.226
What we are saying is that there
are many possibilities of errors

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10098-1
00:57:06.226 --> 00:57:10.555
at many points, so we the more
the complex decision tree we

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10098-2
00:57:10.555 --> 00:57:15.173
build it is it is going to give
more errors in when a new point

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10098-3
00:57:15.173 --> 00:57:19.429
comes in because the decision
tree tends to be a linear, a

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10098-4
00:57:19.429 --> 00:57:23.830
linear decision tree can only
differentiate based on set and

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10098-5
00:57:23.830 --> 00:57:27.654
value less than this or greater
than this and so on.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10114-0
00:57:27.964 --> 00:57:31.094
So this is possibly a concept of
we'll keep it.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10121-0
00:57:31.104 --> 00:57:32.854
I hope you appreciate it.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10130-0
00:57:33.304 --> 00:57:36.174
Otherwise, we'll come back to
this again, OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10143-0
00:57:36.414 --> 00:57:40.886
And and then another aspect is
with respect to handling the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10143-1
00:57:40.886 --> 00:57:41.854
noisy points.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10154-0
00:57:42.344 --> 00:57:46.114
So we can see that the this.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10166-0
00:57:46.564 --> 00:57:51.625
So for example, when let me draw
with a different color print

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10166-1
00:57:51.625 --> 00:57:52.114
color.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10175-0
00:57:52.424 --> 00:57:55.794
So this seems to be a.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10182-0
00:57:56.264 --> 00:57:58.184
This seems to be a reasonable
boundary.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10215-0
00:58:04.644 --> 00:58:09.970
But to be wanted to fit with the
entire training data and one of

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10215-1
00:58:09.970 --> 00:58:14.967
the elements seem to be noise
point and you have no basis to

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10215-2
00:58:14.967 --> 00:58:15.704
validate.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10231-0
00:58:15.714 --> 00:58:19.254
Verify whether it is noise or
not, but then.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10240-0
00:58:19.664 --> 00:58:22.714
But then here suppose that it is
a noise point.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10244-0
00:58:22.724 --> 00:58:23.744
Clearly it is.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10296-0
00:58:23.924 --> 00:58:29.027
We are distorting that model by
considering these lines which

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10296-1
00:58:29.027 --> 00:58:33.719
are which are again, we are
distorting the space for the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10296-2
00:58:33.719 --> 00:58:38.739
classes saying that the blue
class is going having a complex

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10296-3
00:58:38.739 --> 00:58:43.184
space like this and red class
has its complex complex

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10296-4
00:58:43.184 --> 00:58:43.924
boundary.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10302-0
00:58:45.194 --> 00:58:47.164
Accordingly so.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10318-0
00:58:47.174 --> 00:58:51.582
So this is again representing a
problem that if we depend too

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10318-1
00:58:51.582 --> 00:58:53.074
much on the data, OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10323-0
00:58:54.724 --> 00:58:55.314
So.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10336-0
00:58:55.384 --> 00:58:59.834
So now what we do is that let us
take a few minutes break.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10347-0
00:58:59.844 --> 00:59:03.554
We will start looking at how to
create a decision tree.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10379-0
00:59:05.544 --> 00:59:11.165
So this is the explanation of
what is a decision tree and how

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10379-1
00:59:11.165 --> 00:59:16.966
to build a decision tree be we
will come back after after Ohh 3

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10379-2
00:59:16.966 --> 00:59:18.144
minute break.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10423-0
01:02:25.784 --> 01:02:27.824
OK, let's get restarted.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10441-0
01:02:29.094 --> 01:02:33.824
So, so now we see that decision
trees, uh, we have already seen.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10444-0
01:02:33.834 --> 01:02:34.664
How does it look?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10453-0
01:02:35.234 --> 01:02:38.344
So let's go with one step
further.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10472-0
01:02:38.954 --> 01:02:42.881
So we will look at a classic
decision tree algorithm which is

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10472-1
01:02:42.881 --> 01:02:44.654
referred as hunts algorithm.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10481-0
01:02:45.404 --> 01:02:47.434
So it works like this.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10503-0
01:02:47.784 --> 01:02:53.134
So it starts with the training
data set and take the training

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10503-1
01:02:53.134 --> 01:02:56.844
data set and start doing the
partitioning.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10525-0
01:02:57.924 --> 01:03:03.813
So partitioning so that we are
going to get partition training

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10525-1
01:03:03.813 --> 01:03:07.084
data so that we get purer
subsets.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10534-0
01:03:08.454 --> 01:03:11.524
So let me put it this way.
Partition.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10537-0
01:03:16.344 --> 01:03:18.064
Training data.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10542-0
01:03:19.984 --> 01:03:20.664
So that.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10547-0
01:03:23.044 --> 01:03:23.684
We get.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10557-0
01:03:25.584 --> 01:03:27.104
Pewter subsets.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10563-0
01:03:28.484 --> 01:03:30.884
So what are the purest subsets?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10577-0
01:03:31.124 --> 01:03:34.914
Suppose that I somehow did a
partitioning at this point.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10588-0
01:03:34.964 --> 01:03:37.114
Up to this point, how I did it,
I'm not.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10598-0
01:03:37.344 --> 01:03:39.834
So essentially we have to do it
on set and attributes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10606-0
01:03:40.284 --> 01:03:42.424
So now we see that this is pure.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10722-0
01:03:44.694 --> 01:03:49.609
This is all the tuples in this
above the green line or having

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10722-1
01:03:49.609 --> 01:03:54.525
the same class and the below
this so it is impure because the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10722-2
01:03:54.525 --> 01:03:59.519
sum tuples have the class Y and
some tuples have class N so we

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10722-3
01:03:59.519 --> 01:04:04.434
have to have some basis to keep
dividing the training data so

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10722-4
01:04:04.434 --> 01:04:08.398
that we the purity of the
training, the subset is

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10722-5
01:04:08.398 --> 01:04:13.313
increasing more and more until
we reach at some point so that

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10722-6
01:04:13.313 --> 01:04:18.228
everything is pure or or at that
point we decide that we will

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10722-7
01:04:18.228 --> 01:04:22.667
should stop because we don't
want a decision tree to be

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10722-8
01:04:22.667 --> 01:04:24.094
extremely complex.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10730-0
01:04:26.314 --> 01:04:28.464
So so this is the point.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10739-0
01:04:28.594 --> 01:04:30.064
So we what do we do?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10760-0
01:04:30.074 --> 01:04:33.721
We keep partitioning, so in this
case there is no need to

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10760-1
01:04:33.721 --> 01:04:36.864
partition, but we need to
partition this further.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10766-0
01:04:37.034 --> 01:04:38.784
This needs to be partitioned
further.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10775-0
01:04:38.854 --> 01:04:41.124
OK, so now let us let us
proceed.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10786-0
01:04:41.134 --> 01:04:42.704
So let us see with an example.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10793-0
01:04:42.994 --> 01:04:45.924
So then you will be able to
understand.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10800-0
01:04:46.214 --> 01:04:51.024
Suppose that I have initially
initially.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10807-0
01:04:51.034 --> 01:04:51.864
What do I have?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10821-0
01:04:52.214 --> 01:04:59.804
So there is 10 tuples, 77 yens
and three wise.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10849-0
01:05:01.014 --> 01:05:05.508
So at the most basic level, I
say that this training data, if

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10849-1
01:05:05.508 --> 01:05:10.002
I have to simplest conclusion,
saying that most of the people

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10849-2
01:05:10.002 --> 01:05:10.944
do not cheat.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10852-0
01:05:11.404 --> 01:05:11.954
OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10880-0
01:05:12.174 --> 01:05:17.214
But then we are not satisfied
because this is a has only a 30%

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10880-1
01:05:17.214 --> 01:05:20.654
accuracy when out of the 10
tuples 3 or Y.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10889-0
01:05:20.704 --> 01:05:22.894
So maybe we don't want to go.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10894-0
01:05:22.944 --> 01:05:24.234
We want to go one step.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10900-0
01:05:24.364 --> 01:05:25.574
So what do we do?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10922-0
01:05:25.624 --> 01:05:31.855
We proceed be used one of the
attributes refund, so we say

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10922-1
01:05:31.855 --> 01:05:34.284
refund is equal to yes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10945-0
01:05:34.754 --> 01:05:39.110
So in refund is equal to yes,
how many tuples I have 123

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10945-1
01:05:39.110 --> 01:05:41.784
tuples, so there are three
tuples.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10950-0
01:05:42.174 --> 01:05:44.344
All of them have a class label.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10953-0
01:05:46.094 --> 01:05:46.334
No.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10979-0
01:05:47.514 --> 01:05:52.142
So so I can I can in fact
finalize saying that if refund

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10979-1
01:05:52.142 --> 01:05:56.444
is equal to yes, the person is
never underreporting.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10983-0
01:05:56.874 --> 01:05:57.564
So.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/10996-0
01:05:57.614 --> 01:06:00.944
So this is something I can draw
conclusions from this data.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11009-0
01:06:01.214 --> 01:06:04.524
So when refund is equal to yes
in the tax filing.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11024-0
01:06:04.774 --> 01:06:08.904
So I can conclude so this is a
dark square around this.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11039-0
01:06:09.014 --> 01:06:12.567
So saying that I'm drawing the
conclusion and I don't need to

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11039-1
01:06:12.567 --> 01:06:13.484
proceed further.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11052-0
01:06:14.034 --> 01:06:17.544
Now when the refund is equal to
no, there are seven tuples.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11070-0
01:06:18.184 --> 01:06:24.072
Bear the refund is equal to no,
but then out of them three are

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11070-1
01:06:24.072 --> 01:06:26.034
yeses and four or no.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11086-0
01:06:26.824 --> 01:06:31.224
So I have majority of the don't
cheat no, no.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11097-0
01:06:31.444 --> 01:06:34.544
But in spite of that, this is an
impure node.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11104-0
01:06:34.594 --> 01:06:37.064
So I want to proceed with
further splits.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11115-0
01:06:39.864 --> 01:06:41.904
So I come further.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11127-0
01:06:42.044 --> 01:06:46.234
So I see that I want to use next
attribute marital status.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11154-0
01:06:46.344 --> 01:06:49.998
So now I consider among the
people for whom the refund is

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11154-1
01:06:49.998 --> 01:06:53.714
equal to no, I divide the
marital status in multiple ways.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11160-0
01:06:53.944 --> 01:06:55.594
I can I have three values?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11166-0
01:06:55.634 --> 01:06:57.714
Yes, M&amp;D.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11179-0
01:06:57.924 --> 01:07:00.877
So I can always think in terms
of the various possible

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11179-1
01:07:00.877 --> 01:07:01.574
combinations.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11198-0
01:07:01.584 --> 01:07:05.537
So now again, it is a question
of somebody's domain knowledge

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11198-1
01:07:05.537 --> 01:07:06.174
to decide.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11209-0
01:07:06.244 --> 01:07:09.894
So I can say that I can define
like there's three parts.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11238-0
01:07:10.464 --> 01:07:15.114
Yes, M&amp;B or I can define
this as A2 parts where yes and

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11238-1
01:07:15.114 --> 01:07:19.764
MRD together or D's together I
can have another path where?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11241-0
01:07:19.774 --> 01:07:20.134
Yes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11265-0
01:07:20.144 --> 01:07:23.483
And D are together in the M is
together so there can be

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11265-1
01:07:23.483 --> 01:07:26.464
multiple options with respect to
what you can do.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11318-0
01:07:27.624 --> 01:07:31.207
OK, so so the point is you can
also have something like E MD on

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11318-1
01:07:31.207 --> 01:07:34.454
one side and this is something
but then it is really your

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11318-2
01:07:34.454 --> 01:07:37.701
intuition and your domain
knowledge that decides which is

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11318-3
01:07:37.701 --> 01:07:39.044
possibly the best split.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11339-0
01:07:40.694 --> 01:07:43.514
And now what I will do, let me I
have to.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11342-0
01:07:43.514 --> 01:07:45.434
It said here in this example.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11358-0
01:07:45.444 --> 01:07:49.794
Uh, at very first step you are
focused where refund is no.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11356-0
01:07:47.754 --> 01:07:48.104
Hmm.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11367-0
01:07:51.074 --> 01:07:53.304
Yes, refund is equal to yes or
no.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11380-0
01:07:53.314 --> 01:07:55.994
Yeah, that is the first
attribute we considered, yes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11381-0
01:07:57.434 --> 01:07:57.784
OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11397-0
01:07:57.794 --> 01:08:01.354
And after taking no you you
carry forward for that.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11431-0
01:08:01.514 --> 01:08:04.727
Yes, that is right we because
with the when the refund is

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11431-1
01:08:04.727 --> 01:08:08.272
equal to yes, we have seen that
what we got is a pure node, all

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11431-2
01:08:08.272 --> 01:08:10.764
the three tuples they are of the
same class.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11441-0
01:08:11.194 --> 01:08:14.534
So we take it that OK, we got
some level of.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11474-0
01:08:15.274 --> 01:08:19.089
Uh, the confidence that OK with
this, we can keep it as one of

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11474-1
01:08:19.089 --> 01:08:22.842
our learning and I proceed with
when refund is equal to no, I

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11474-2
01:08:22.842 --> 01:08:24.174
want to learn further.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11484-0
01:08:27.354 --> 01:08:27.574
OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11495-0
01:08:28.504 --> 01:08:30.234
Sir, is it like evaluating?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11496-0
01:08:28.534 --> 01:08:31.114
Uh, it is that the question or
something else?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11494-0
01:08:28.864 --> 01:08:29.104
OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11509-0
01:08:33.784 --> 01:08:35.184
And Mr Santosh, what is the
question?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11511-0
01:08:36.124 --> 01:08:36.474
No, no.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11519-0
01:08:36.484 --> 01:08:38.754
I was asking is it like
evaluating them?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11527-0
01:08:38.804 --> 01:08:40.364
We do for null hypothesis.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11547-0
01:08:41.614 --> 01:08:45.610
I don't call it null hypothesis,
we use it the only in this in

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11547-1
01:08:45.610 --> 01:08:46.244
that case.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11565-0
01:08:46.334 --> 01:08:49.087
But in this case we are
evaluating for the class labels

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11565-1
01:08:49.087 --> 01:08:50.414
purity of the class labels.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11571-0
01:08:50.424 --> 01:08:51.124
How to evaluate?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11606-0
01:08:51.134 --> 01:08:54.672
We'll come to that, but now we
can see through the example we

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11606-1
01:08:54.672 --> 01:08:58.267
are clearly seeing that we can
go further with one path and in

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11606-2
01:08:58.267 --> 01:09:00.834
the other part you don't need to
go further.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11610-0
01:09:02.884 --> 01:09:03.224
OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11619-0
01:09:04.584 --> 01:09:05.024
Thank you, Sir.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11627-0
01:09:04.684 --> 01:09:08.594
Alright, so now now let us let
us go step by step.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11631-0
01:09:08.664 --> 01:09:09.394
So.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11646-0
01:09:09.444 --> 01:09:15.177
So now what we know is that in
this case, let me write with

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11646-1
01:09:15.177 --> 01:09:15.654
this.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11694-0
01:09:15.724 --> 01:09:21.720
So in this case this is 3 N, so
in this case 3Y and 4N and then

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11694-1
01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:27.527
we go one step further and now
we have decided that we divide

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11694-2
01:09:27.527 --> 01:09:31.274
this in marital status into two
groups.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11712-0
01:09:31.284 --> 01:09:36.369
One is M and other is yes D and
then again this is an arbitrary

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11712-1
01:09:36.369 --> 01:09:37.084
decision.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11725-0
01:09:37.094 --> 01:09:39.564
So let us at this point it is an
arbitrary decision.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11730-0
01:09:39.674 --> 01:09:40.484
We can see.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11735-0
01:09:40.874 --> 01:09:43.184
Then we can see when married.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11752-0
01:09:43.794 --> 01:09:47.075
So now let us consider the
refund is equal to no and

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11752-1
01:09:47.075 --> 01:09:48.684
marital status is married.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11759-0
01:09:48.914 --> 01:09:50.144
So how many tuples are there?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11782-0
01:09:50.254 --> 01:09:55.425
One second tuple is like this
and then then six tuple is like

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11782-1
01:09:55.425 --> 01:09:58.594
this and then 9th tuple is like
this.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11801-0
01:09:58.604 --> 01:10:03.806
So what we are seeing is that
there are three ants, so this is

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11801-1
01:10:03.806 --> 01:10:04.384
a pure.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11822-0
01:10:04.804 --> 01:10:07.910
So this again we can finalize
when refund is equal to no and

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11822-1
01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:09.234
marital status is married.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11872-0
01:10:09.434 --> 01:10:14.664
So this and on this side we have
1 N and three wise so the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11872-1
01:10:14.664 --> 01:10:20.337
majority class is cheat but then
still it is not a pure node so

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11872-2
01:10:20.337 --> 01:10:25.478
we can proceed one more step we
use that we have one more

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11872-3
01:10:25.478 --> 01:10:27.694
attribute taxable income.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11886-0
01:10:27.704 --> 01:10:31.390
We use the taxable income, so
then we are getting the pure

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11886-1
01:10:31.390 --> 01:10:31.764
nodes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11907-0
01:10:31.774 --> 01:10:35.875
So here in this case we are
saying that this is 3 Y and this

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11907-1
01:10:35.875 --> 01:10:36.614
is one end.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11913-0
01:10:37.004 --> 01:10:38.374
This is 3 end.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11928-0
01:10:38.444 --> 01:10:43.234
This is 3 end so so we have a
full decision tree.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11966-0
01:10:43.494 --> 01:10:48.450
So where we have 4 leaf nodes
and those leaf nodes are giving

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11966-1
01:10:48.450 --> 01:10:53.246
us the class labels and the
internal nodes are directing us

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11966-2
01:10:53.246 --> 01:10:55.484
to evaluate for a new tuple.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/11979-0
01:10:55.694 --> 01:10:58.604
How to which path to take to
proceed further?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12000-0
01:11:00.164 --> 01:11:04.835
So this is the simple hands
algorithm and now the question

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12000-1
01:11:04.835 --> 01:11:08.634
will be that the there are many
considerations.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12021-0
01:11:09.084 --> 01:11:14.764
First thing is that the we are
the we are this is called as a

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12021-1
01:11:14.764 --> 01:11:17.604
greedy strategy at every point.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12026-0
01:11:22.094 --> 01:11:23.644
We are trying to.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12038-0
01:11:23.694 --> 01:11:26.384
We are trying to take the next
best step.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12051-0
01:11:26.434 --> 01:11:29.704
We are not considering the next
two next three best steps.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12060-0
01:11:29.834 --> 01:11:31.804
We are only considering the next
best step.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12077-0
01:11:31.814 --> 01:11:34.991
This is called as a greedy
strategy and then what are the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12077-1
01:11:34.991 --> 01:11:35.374
issues?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12085-0
01:11:35.384 --> 01:11:37.474
So we need to address how to
split.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12120-0
01:11:38.814 --> 01:11:42.340
OK, So what is the test
condition and how do we know

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12120-1
01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:46.665
that this is the best split and
when to start splitting so these

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12120-2
01:11:46.665 --> 01:11:50.124
are all the questions that we
still need to answer.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12132-0
01:11:52.114 --> 01:11:56.284
OK, so now how to specify the
split condition?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12144-0
01:11:56.534 --> 01:12:00.524
So that depends on the
attributes that we have.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12182-0
01:12:00.634 --> 01:12:04.239
The attributes can be nominal,
ordinal or continuous, and then

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12182-1
01:12:04.239 --> 01:12:07.843
the types of the split that we
can have, we can have a two way

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12182-2
01:12:07.843 --> 01:12:10.074
split or we can have a multiway
split.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12193-0
01:12:10.654 --> 01:12:13.364
So, so now let us look at the
examples.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12202-0
01:12:13.774 --> 01:12:16.934
So this is indicating a multi
base plate.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12224-0
01:12:19.374 --> 01:12:24.135
So we are saying that the car
type can be family or sports car

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12224-1
01:12:24.135 --> 01:12:25.344
or a luxury car.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12252-0
01:12:25.954 --> 01:12:31.069
So we are making them in 2-3
splits, so alternately we can

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12252-1
01:12:31.069 --> 01:12:35.924
think in terms of only two
splits split into two paths.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12278-0
01:12:35.984 --> 01:12:40.396
So in that case, we need to club
one of the two two of the three

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12278-1
01:12:40.396 --> 01:12:42.974
and then keep the other one
separate.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12288-0
01:12:44.114 --> 01:12:48.724
And what happens when we have
ordinal attributes?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12308-0
01:12:49.554 --> 01:12:52.824
So we can think in terms of
ordinary, small, medium, large

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12308-1
01:12:52.824 --> 01:12:53.544
for the site.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12342-0
01:12:53.874 --> 01:12:59.196
So we can go with that or we can
do a division small medium on

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12342-1
01:12:59.196 --> 01:13:04.602
one side and large on the other
side or medium and large on one

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12342-2
01:13:04.602 --> 01:13:07.474
side and small on the other
side.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12347-0
01:13:10.144 --> 01:13:11.194
But what about this?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12351-0
01:13:13.244 --> 01:13:13.904
Does this work?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12367-0
01:13:16.434 --> 01:13:20.258
Do you think this is ever this
is something that we will ever

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12367-1
01:13:20.258 --> 01:13:20.504
use?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12369-0
01:13:21.954 --> 01:13:22.154
No.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12378-0
01:13:23.804 --> 01:13:26.094
Yes, unlikely that we will use
it.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12409-0
01:13:26.144 --> 01:13:30.873
Unlikely, but then there may be
some kind of situations that we

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12409-1
01:13:30.873 --> 01:13:35.380
can imagine because again the
ordinal is actually depends on

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12409-2
01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:36.784
the way you define.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12418-0
01:13:36.794 --> 01:13:41.274
For example, let us take the
railway reservations.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12435-0
01:13:41.664 --> 01:13:46.014
So suppose that the age is we
are considering as ordinal.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12453-0
01:13:46.024 --> 01:13:50.759
We are treating the age groups,
for example child then adult and

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12453-1
01:13:50.759 --> 01:13:51.924
senior citizens.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12482-0
01:13:51.934 --> 01:13:56.503
We can treat that as an ordinal
attribute if we think that the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12482-1
01:13:56.503 --> 01:14:01.144
age is the only the size or the
OR the value of the edge count.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12512-0
01:14:01.514 --> 01:14:04.876
So, but then what happens is
that the railways gives

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12512-1
01:14:04.876 --> 01:14:08.872
concessions to child and senior
citizens, but railway does not

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12512-2
01:14:08.872 --> 01:14:10.774
give concession to the adults.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12539-0
01:14:11.644 --> 01:14:15.071
So so sometimes you may have
some Special Situations where

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12539-1
01:14:15.071 --> 01:14:18.614
you think that, yes, ordinal
attribute may have to be split.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12587-0
01:14:18.624 --> 01:14:22.987
But then again, we are going
into the pure domain space, so

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12587-1
01:14:22.987 --> 01:14:27.494
it is the domain that demands
that you take the approach, but

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12587-2
01:14:27.494 --> 01:14:32.075
it is as as you pointed out, it
is more likely that we will go

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12587-3
01:14:32.075 --> 01:14:33.674
with these approaches.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12593-0
01:14:34.894 --> 01:14:35.824
It is more likely.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12602-0
01:14:40.674 --> 01:14:44.654
But this can be a specific
domain based.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12617-0
01:14:52.574 --> 01:14:56.164
OK, so now let us look at the
continuous attributes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12620-0
01:14:56.174 --> 01:14:57.544
Continuous attributes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12642-0
01:14:57.774 --> 01:15:02.115
We are saying the income, which
is a value which can take from

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12642-1
01:15:02.115 --> 01:15:05.284
anywhere from let's say 10,000
to 10 billion.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12655-0
01:15:05.694 --> 01:15:09.464
So now, now we are talking about
how to handle the income.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12667-0
01:15:09.974 --> 01:15:13.784
So income is we can take
multiple approaches.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12677-0
01:15:14.214 --> 01:15:17.724
One is that we can do a
discretization.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12696-0
01:15:17.814 --> 01:15:21.913
We have already studied how can
we do a discretization and then

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12696-1
01:15:21.913 --> 01:15:24.474
the IT becomes a categorical
attribute.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12715-0
01:15:24.834 --> 01:15:30.784
So now we are dividing the all
the income into instead of

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12715-1
01:15:30.784 --> 01:15:31.604
numbers.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12726-0
01:15:31.614 --> 01:15:35.635
We are calling this as a low
income, middle income and high

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12726-1
01:15:35.635 --> 01:15:36.104
income.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12736-0
01:15:38.364 --> 01:15:40.094
Or it can be more than three.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12770-0
01:15:40.104 --> 01:15:43.681
We can go for five groups, six
groups, so just we call it ultra

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12770-1
01:15:43.681 --> 01:15:47.146
High and upper middle class or
below poverty and we can start

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12770-2
01:15:47.146 --> 01:15:48.654
creating many, many groups.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12801-0
01:15:49.194 --> 01:15:52.880
So in that case, what we are
doing is we are doing a

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12801-1
01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:56.983
discretization, then we can
treat after discretization the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12801-2
01:15:56.983 --> 01:16:00.739
the attribute continuous
attribute like a categorical

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12801-3
01:16:00.739 --> 01:16:01.434
attribute.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12819-0
01:16:03.974 --> 01:16:08.514
The problem with that is that
that is static and it static.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12837-0
01:16:08.524 --> 01:16:13.499
One can also work very well for
some many situations, but then

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12837-1
01:16:13.499 --> 01:16:16.184
sometimes you may have a
problem.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12842-0
01:16:16.534 --> 01:16:19.104
For example, what will happen?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12853-0
01:16:19.174 --> 01:16:21.344
Suppose that we have an income
tax data.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12855-0
01:16:21.534 --> 01:16:22.024
OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12870-0
01:16:22.274 --> 01:16:25.724
We have income tax data and then
we are solving the same problem.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12903-0
01:16:26.454 --> 01:16:29.643
That is, we are we are trying to
help Indian income tax

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12903-1
01:16:29.643 --> 01:16:33.174
department but what the Indian
income Tax department gave you

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12903-2
01:16:33.174 --> 01:16:35.224
gave us is the 100 years of X
data.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12927-0
01:16:36.914 --> 01:16:40.866
Ohh so they have been collecting
taxes for so long and then they

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12927-1
01:16:40.866 --> 01:16:43.844
said that OK, you start building
a model for us.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12951-0
01:16:44.174 --> 01:16:48.493
So what will be the problem if
we take the income and we use a

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12951-1
01:16:48.493 --> 01:16:51.304
static labels like low, high and
middle?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12970-0
01:16:53.904 --> 01:16:55.854
Just imagine what can be the
problem.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12989-0
01:16:56.374 --> 01:17:00.094
But the difference was being
three years.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12981-0
01:16:56.584 --> 01:16:58.224
Inflation first of all.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12980-0
01:16:57.014 --> 01:16:58.034
And inflation.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12990-0
01:17:00.204 --> 01:17:01.874
Uh, can you repeat?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/12992-0
01:17:01.884 --> 01:17:02.074
What?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13004-0
01:17:02.084 --> 01:17:03.334
What is it you said, Mr Rajesh?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13016-0
01:17:04.354 --> 01:17:06.896
And the definition of low,
medium, high is continuously

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13016-1
01:17:06.896 --> 01:17:07.304
changing.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13019-0
01:17:08.094 --> 01:17:08.804
Absolutely.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13022-0
01:17:08.814 --> 01:17:09.604
Right, right.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13024-0
01:17:09.614 --> 01:17:10.284
That is correct.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13028-0
01:17:10.334 --> 01:17:11.124
Absolutely right.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13044-0
01:17:11.354 --> 01:17:13.959
That is the that is the point I
was hoping to hear from one of

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13044-1
01:17:13.959 --> 01:17:14.124
you.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13061-0
01:17:14.714 --> 01:17:17.633
So so now the question is that
you obviously have to think

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13061-1
01:17:17.633 --> 01:17:18.424
about it, right?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13114-0
01:17:18.804 --> 01:17:22.752
So for example, your company may
give you a data with 20 years

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13114-1
01:17:22.752 --> 01:17:26.511
because the many companies are
there in business for a long

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13114-2
01:17:26.511 --> 01:17:30.271
time and then they say that, OK,
this is the values of what

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13114-3
01:17:30.271 --> 01:17:33.780
happened with the various
customers or various products

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13114-4
01:17:33.780 --> 01:17:34.594
and all that.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13129-0
01:17:35.344 --> 01:17:39.874
So now you need to consider many
factors before you say that.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13131-0
01:17:39.884 --> 01:17:40.214
OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13140-0
01:17:40.464 --> 01:17:43.424
Can I discretize or do I have to
think more?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13165-0
01:17:52.014 --> 01:17:57.728
So one approach can be somehow
do a categorical, convert it

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13165-1
01:17:57.728 --> 01:18:02.584
into categorical or or or do go
for binning right?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13177-0
01:18:03.134 --> 01:18:07.804
So so we are doing a equal
interval type of mining.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13186-0
01:18:08.014 --> 01:18:09.694
So this can be one approach.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13218-0
01:18:10.564 --> 01:18:14.865
This can be one approach equal
interval binning or equal

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13218-1
01:18:14.865 --> 01:18:19.770
frequency one we can go for that
or we can go for percentiles or

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13218-2
01:18:19.770 --> 01:18:21.354
or clustering wheels.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13220-0
01:18:21.364 --> 01:18:22.534
Study that later.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13232-0
01:18:22.544 --> 01:18:24.494
How can we use that clustering?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13239-0
01:18:24.814 --> 01:18:27.584
Then we can use a binary one.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13248-0
01:18:28.364 --> 01:18:31.594
So less than or greater than so.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13270-0
01:18:31.664 --> 01:18:36.887
So the point is we have to think
we have to think and we have to

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13270-1
01:18:36.887 --> 01:18:38.734
think about the domain.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13279-0
01:18:38.744 --> 01:18:40.214
We have to think about the data.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13333-0
01:18:40.324 --> 01:18:44.410
Then we can decide what to do
with the categorical, because

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13333-1
01:18:44.410 --> 01:18:48.496
the problem with the problem
with the continuous attributes

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13333-2
01:18:48.496 --> 01:18:52.650
is that you may have a large
number of values, so so the for

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13333-3
01:18:52.650 --> 01:18:56.940
example in your company there
may be 10,000 employees, but the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13333-4
01:18:56.940 --> 01:19:00.004
salary of each 10,000 employee
is different.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13348-0
01:19:00.874 --> 01:19:03.604
So it is possible that you have
10,000 numbers.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13386-0
01:19:03.974 --> 01:19:07.826
So in that case it is not easy
for you to think in terms, but

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13386-1
01:19:07.826 --> 01:19:11.491
maybe in government they can
identify the grades or scales

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13386-2
01:19:11.491 --> 01:19:15.404
because which is typical with
the public sector or government.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13416-0
01:19:15.914 --> 01:19:19.336
But in private you may not have
that, so you may have each

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13416-1
01:19:19.336 --> 01:19:23.106
individual may have some salary
which they have computed through

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13416-2
01:19:23.106 --> 01:19:23.744
some basis.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13447-0
01:19:24.054 --> 01:19:29.098
So so now the point is that you
need to think of intelligent

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13447-1
01:19:29.098 --> 01:19:33.728
ways in which you can handle
such a data to build a the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13447-2
01:19:33.728 --> 01:19:34.224
model.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13458-0
01:19:37.544 --> 01:19:39.404
So here is a pictorial for the
same.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13479-0
01:19:40.284 --> 01:19:43.892
So you can think in terms of
binary split or you can think in

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13479-1
01:19:43.892 --> 01:19:45.404
terms of a multiway split.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13484-0
01:19:49.844 --> 01:19:50.174
Good.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13500-0
01:19:50.644 --> 01:19:54.465
Can you just explain once again,
I'm not very much clear about

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13500-1
01:19:54.465 --> 01:19:55.374
discretization.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13508-0
01:19:58.584 --> 01:20:01.234
Discretization you don't
understand discretization.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13520-0
01:20:01.244 --> 01:20:02.494
What is that you don't
understand?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13522-0
01:20:02.784 --> 01:20:03.634
Yes, Sir.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13540-0
01:20:03.864 --> 01:20:07.224
I am not very much of a table
with this term.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13546-0
01:20:06.934 --> 01:20:10.084
So suppose that there are people
with varying incomes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13549-0
01:20:10.554 --> 01:20:11.264
Is that clear?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13558-0
01:20:11.344 --> 01:20:13.064
There are people with diverse
incomes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13617-0
01:20:14.184 --> 01:20:19.094
So now you can say that somebody
below ₹20,000 income you say is

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13565-0
01:20:14.474 --> 01:20:14.654
Yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13617-1
01:20:19.094 --> 01:20:23.702
a low low lower level income and
20,000 to ₹1,00,000 you say

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13617-2
01:20:23.702 --> 01:20:28.461
middle level income and above
1,00,000 you say high income but

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13617-3
01:20:28.461 --> 01:20:30.274
does that is that clear.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13629-0
01:20:30.524 --> 01:20:34.323
So the three are actually
category categories are discrete

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13629-1
01:20:34.323 --> 01:20:35.224
values, right?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13635-0
01:20:36.074 --> 01:20:36.574
Yes or no.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13637-0
01:20:37.794 --> 01:20:38.184
Yes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13648-0
01:20:38.194 --> 01:20:40.254
So we are doing categorization
there.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13657-0
01:20:41.014 --> 01:20:43.282
Yeah, that is what is not
discretization leads to

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13657-1
01:20:43.282 --> 01:20:44.234
categorization right?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13678-0
01:20:44.414 --> 01:20:47.915
Because you created when you
create discrete intervals, each

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13678-1
01:20:47.915 --> 01:20:49.464
discrete intervals becomes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13693-0
01:20:49.474 --> 01:20:52.704
Can be called as a category or
we without even category.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13710-0
01:20:52.714 --> 01:20:56.094
Also, you can keep it saying
that you want to treat zero to

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13710-1
01:20:56.094 --> 01:20:56.544
20 as a.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13718-0
01:20:56.554 --> 01:20:57.964
You don't give a low.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13729-0
01:20:58.094 --> 01:21:01.474
You give the label as under 20
and then 20 to 40.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13743-0
01:21:01.484 --> 01:21:04.024
You don't call it middle, but
you say 20 to 40.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13754-0
01:21:04.024 --> 01:21:05.374
Which is the label can be
anything.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13782-0
01:21:06.174 --> 01:21:10.038
But I said low middle higher
because so that you the IT is

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13782-1
01:21:10.038 --> 01:21:14.164
easy to see what is the purpose
but the label can be anything.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13783-0
01:21:15.184 --> 01:21:16.024
OK, OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13794-0
01:21:20.904 --> 01:21:24.284
So now now we are have got 20
records.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13798-0
01:21:24.834 --> 01:21:27.024
OK, so 20 records.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13805-0
01:21:31.644 --> 01:21:34.154
20 training tuples.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13808-0
01:21:38.374 --> 01:21:39.144
OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13833-0
01:21:39.194 --> 01:21:44.747
And then 10 records of Class 0
and 10 records of class one and

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13833-1
01:21:44.747 --> 01:21:49.154
we have 3 attributes to choose
to split the data.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13848-0
01:21:51.624 --> 01:21:55.244
And now I have given you the
three splits that are possible.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13859-0
01:21:56.274 --> 01:22:00.064
Think about them and tell me
which one you are liking.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13874-0
01:22:25.164 --> 01:22:26.514
I hope the question is clear.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13884-0
01:22:26.604 --> 01:22:29.474
You have to tell me which split
are you liking?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13892-0
01:22:32.174 --> 01:22:32.864
Among the three.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13895-0
01:22:33.014 --> 01:22:34.304
The cartoon one.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13901-0
01:22:35.724 --> 01:22:36.524
A.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13899-0
01:22:35.934 --> 01:22:36.244
That.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13916-0
01:22:36.254 --> 01:22:37.254
Yeah, got type.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13921-0
01:22:36.574 --> 01:22:38.464
Will you be little lighter?
Yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13929-0
01:22:37.734 --> 01:22:39.754
OK, when the car type 1.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13926-0
01:22:39.144 --> 01:22:39.554
Cartoon.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13931-0
01:22:40.594 --> 01:22:41.464
The car type?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13940-0
01:22:41.474 --> 01:22:43.484
You're liking that is Mr Rajesh.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13942-0
01:22:43.154 --> 01:22:43.334
No.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13950-0
01:22:43.534 --> 01:22:44.874
OK, so anybody?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13972-0
01:22:44.704 --> 01:22:49.814
I I would go for the first one
to know whether somebody's.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13989-0
01:22:48.394 --> 01:22:52.088
OK, Mr Anirudh, guys preferring
the first one, Mr Rajesh is

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/13989-1
01:22:52.088 --> 01:22:55.104
saying the second one which is
the car type. OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14015-0
01:22:55.234 --> 01:22:59.040
So anybody have is a they you
can give anything you can agree

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14015-1
01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:02.784
with either of them or you can
still go for a different one.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14023-0
01:23:03.984 --> 01:23:05.314
So you you can speak.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14037-0
01:23:05.384 --> 01:23:09.074
OK, Mr Amri, Amitesh is also
going for the second one.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14040-0
01:23:09.124 --> 01:23:09.514
OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14050-0
01:23:09.524 --> 01:23:11.514
So second one, we have got more
people going for it.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14056-0
01:23:14.064 --> 01:23:14.484
No.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14061-0
01:23:14.534 --> 01:23:15.104
OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14067-0
01:23:14.834 --> 01:23:16.274
First one is just binary.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14077-0
01:23:15.024 --> 01:23:15.774
Yeah, second.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14076-0
01:23:15.194 --> 01:23:15.694
OK, miss.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14073-0
01:23:16.284 --> 01:23:16.864
Yes or no.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14088-0
01:23:16.874 --> 01:23:20.954
So so it's more clear giving
more clear direction.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14114-0
01:23:21.044 --> 01:23:25.504
OK, so so the point is what Mr
Remick is saying is that the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14114-1
01:23:25.504 --> 01:23:29.591
first one is a simple to
interpret, so that is that is

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14114-2
01:23:29.591 --> 01:23:30.334
something.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14116-0
01:23:31.144 --> 01:23:31.714
OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14130-0
01:23:31.794 --> 01:23:35.834
But but then many people are
going for the second one.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14156-0
01:23:35.884 --> 01:23:39.358
So somebody who is going for the
second one, can you explain in

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14156-1
01:23:39.358 --> 01:23:41.854
your own words why do you want
to go for 2nd?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14186-0
01:23:43.214 --> 01:23:48.794
Uh, because Sir, if we go for
the second type itself is saying

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14186-1
01:23:48.794 --> 01:23:54.109
that somebody's owning car, but
that information is already

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14186-2
01:23:54.109 --> 01:23:54.994
there and.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14187-0
01:23:55.064 --> 01:23:55.404
OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14204-0
01:23:58.134 --> 01:23:58.604
Yes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14198-0
01:23:58.404 --> 01:23:58.854
No, no.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14217-0
01:23:58.664 --> 01:24:01.804
So we have second gives.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14215-0
01:23:58.904 --> 01:24:01.704
Owning the thought is yes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14224-0
01:23:59.594 --> 01:24:04.264
I think second because based on
the yeah, please go ahead.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14229-0
01:24:04.774 --> 01:24:06.414
So, so on.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14232-0
01:24:06.474 --> 01:24:07.844
So it depends.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14267-0
01:24:07.854 --> 01:24:13.332
It depends what's the what
outcome we need, what kind of

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14267-1
01:24:13.332 --> 01:24:16.214
model we want to make on base.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14252-0
01:24:15.324 --> 01:24:15.734
OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14259-0
01:24:15.744 --> 01:24:16.414
OK, Mr.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14264-0
01:24:16.424 --> 01:24:17.304
Lee, Mr be.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14268-0
01:24:17.314 --> 01:24:17.954
Just hold.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14301-0
01:24:17.964 --> 01:24:21.661
Let us give others chance,
because I I I I understood

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14392-0
01:24:21.144 --> 01:24:25.763
It so the second one gives more
data in a sense like if you have

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14301-1
01:24:21.661 --> 01:24:23.714
whatever you're trying to but.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14392-1
01:24:25.763 --> 01:24:30.169
car like 6-4 persons are there
who have car and they are like

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14392-2
01:24:30.169 --> 01:24:34.504
this model gives more data in a
sense like which type of car

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14392-3
01:24:34.504 --> 01:24:38.697
they have and the ones who
doesn't have anything like that

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14392-4
01:24:38.697 --> 01:24:43.245
information we already have that
it that doesn't have like they

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14392-5
01:24:43.245 --> 01:24:45.874
don't have car so it covers all
the.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14378-0
01:24:44.534 --> 01:24:44.994
Ohk.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14393-0
01:24:44.664 --> 01:24:46.184
I I will come.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14383-0
01:24:45.004 --> 01:24:45.694
OK. OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14387-0
01:24:45.764 --> 01:24:46.614
No, no, no.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14389-0
01:24:46.624 --> 01:24:47.014
OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14401-0
01:24:47.304 --> 01:24:49.244
Yeah, Mr Amitesh, you want to go
further?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14425-0
01:24:51.394 --> 01:24:54.965
Yeah, I mean it, it covers more
scenarios like we have more data

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14425-1
01:24:54.965 --> 01:24:55.734
with this one.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14434-0
01:24:55.694 --> 01:24:59.384
OK, three scenarios, but then
what is what is give?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14442-0
01:24:59.394 --> 01:25:02.104
What is pushing you to go for
second one?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14455-0
01:25:02.194 --> 01:25:03.764
Forget about the attribute name.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14461-0
01:25:03.444 --> 01:25:04.114
Still early.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14480-0
01:25:03.834 --> 01:25:07.034
So let let me let me give you
some some.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14475-0
01:25:04.484 --> 01:25:04.684
So.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14497-0
01:25:04.544 --> 01:25:08.794
Come understand why that I
understand.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14488-0
01:25:07.094 --> 01:25:08.224
Let me give you some hint.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14516-0
01:25:08.554 --> 01:25:11.191
It's no call this as an
attribute one call this as an

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14516-1
01:25:11.191 --> 01:25:13.144
attribute, 2 call this as an
attribute.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14521-0
01:25:13.154 --> 01:25:14.684
Three, forget about the rest,
OK?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14532-0
01:25:14.694 --> 01:25:17.004
This attribute you can keep this
OK?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14557-0
01:25:17.014 --> 01:25:21.205
You still call it as attribute
3, so now now you think about

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14557-1
01:25:21.205 --> 01:25:23.334
which one seems to be a better.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14559-0
01:25:23.424 --> 01:25:24.264
A better split?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14605-0
01:25:25.384 --> 01:25:29.074
Forget about the name of the
class name of the attribute and

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14594-0
01:25:28.264 --> 01:25:30.054
Uh, they can.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14605-1
01:25:29.074 --> 01:25:31.554
also the call it as a value one
value 2.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14620-0
01:25:30.854 --> 01:25:34.519
I went for it because it has
more pure it has more pure,

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14616-0
01:25:32.014 --> 01:25:35.254
Second, have a categorization
categorization.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14620-1
01:25:34.519 --> 01:25:36.254
pure, almost pure subjects.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14622-0
01:25:37.064 --> 01:25:37.544
Ohh.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14625-0
01:25:37.554 --> 01:25:38.344
OK, OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14628-0
01:25:38.354 --> 01:25:39.184
Who is who is this?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14632-0
01:25:41.324 --> 01:25:41.634
Yes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14634-0
01:25:41.644 --> 01:25:41.984
Who is this?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14654-0
01:25:43.964 --> 01:25:46.604
Mr Rajesh, who said this pure.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14643-0
01:25:44.224 --> 01:25:44.414
Yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14658-0
01:25:45.754 --> 01:25:48.984
Ah, I said that because it has
more pure subsets.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14677-0
01:25:48.994 --> 01:25:50.114
Basically the 2nd, that's why I.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14667-0
01:25:49.334 --> 01:25:49.744
Yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14670-0
01:25:49.754 --> 01:25:50.624
OK, OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14679-0
01:25:50.674 --> 01:25:51.624
So what is the?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14687-0
01:25:51.634 --> 01:25:53.274
What is the purity that you are
observing?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14730-0
01:25:54.754 --> 01:25:58.098
So there is one set where you
know, like all it's 80 split

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14730-1
01:25:58.098 --> 01:26:01.384
basically right, which means
it's you have upset already.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14718-0
01:25:59.334 --> 01:26:00.584
You absolutely right.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14725-0
01:26:00.594 --> 01:26:02.664
Like that is that is very good,
right?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14728-0
01:26:02.674 --> 01:26:02.884
Right.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14763-0
01:26:02.894 --> 01:26:07.081
That is very good observation,
saying that when one value it

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14763-1
01:26:07.081 --> 01:26:11.198
takes, it is clearly doing a
complete classification of the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14763-2
01:26:11.198 --> 01:26:13.394
tuples based on only that value.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14772-0
01:26:14.114 --> 01:26:15.154
So it is pure.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14786-0
01:26:15.164 --> 01:26:18.179
Even others are nearly pure,
though they are not pure,

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14786-1
01:26:18.179 --> 01:26:19.714
they're not completely pure.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14792-0
01:26:20.034 --> 01:26:21.514
Others are nearly pure.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14802-0
01:26:21.764 --> 01:26:23.424
Do other people are able to see
this?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14810-0
01:26:24.324 --> 01:26:25.574
So this is the.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14817-0
01:26:25.164 --> 01:26:25.624
Yes, Sir.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14823-0
01:26:25.634 --> 01:26:29.494
This is the kind of intuition
you need to get.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14832-0
01:26:29.504 --> 01:26:32.534
This other people are able to
see that I'm.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14842-0
01:26:32.544 --> 01:26:34.294
I'm just waiting for answers
from the other.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14844-0
01:26:33.384 --> 01:26:33.824
Yes, Sir.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14848-0
01:26:34.704 --> 01:26:35.144
Yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14886-0
01:26:35.204 --> 01:26:39.252
So seeing that the this is
giving you a improvement in

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14857-0
01:26:35.514 --> 01:26:36.574
We agree, we agree.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14886-1
01:26:39.252 --> 01:26:43.814
purity, significant improvement
because at this point at this

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14886-2
01:26:43.814 --> 01:26:48.303
point it is completely impure,
because 1010 means that it is

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14886-3
01:26:48.303 --> 01:26:49.774
completely confused.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14923-0
01:26:50.124 --> 01:26:54.429
You it will not help you with
the drawing any conclusion but

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14923-1
01:26:54.429 --> 01:26:58.945
the moment you use these values
of this attribute you could see

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14923-2
01:26:58.945 --> 01:27:02.685
that you got something
absolutely pure and these two

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14923-3
01:27:02.685 --> 01:27:03.814
are nearly pure.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14946-0
01:27:07.124 --> 01:27:11.321
So that helps you in proceeding
further with greater confidence

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/14946-1
01:27:11.321 --> 01:27:14.534
that, yes, you are going in the
right direction.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15018-0
01:27:16.674 --> 01:27:21.487
OK, this is this has got too
many splits so this may not be a

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15018-1
01:27:21.487 --> 01:27:26.300
good attribute and in fact you
can see that the student ID is

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15018-2
01:27:26.300 --> 01:27:30.724
the name of the attribute
whenever you have got too many

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15018-3
01:27:30.724 --> 01:27:35.382
splits then you have to be
concerned that if then you start

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15018-4
01:27:35.382 --> 01:27:40.195
thinking whether is it really a
very indicative attribute for

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15018-5
01:27:40.195 --> 01:27:41.514
the class or not.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15030-0
01:27:44.614 --> 01:27:48.484
OK, so now now we we have to
think about.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15054-0
01:27:48.994 --> 01:27:53.053
So the greedy approach that we
talked about for building the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15054-1
01:27:53.053 --> 01:27:56.979
classifier decision tree is
straight away saying that this

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15054-2
01:27:56.979 --> 01:27:57.444
is bad.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15062-0
01:27:57.514 --> 01:27:58.754
It is saying that this is bad.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15082-0
01:28:00.154 --> 01:28:04.859
This is good anytime you get
this type of node nearly pure

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15082-1
01:28:04.859 --> 01:28:06.294
and highly impure.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15115-0
01:28:06.304 --> 01:28:10.879
So this call you call it as a
impurity, we're we're all the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15115-1
01:28:10.879 --> 01:28:15.377
classes are equally present and
one class is almost of one

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15115-2
01:28:15.377 --> 01:28:15.834
class.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15123-0
01:28:16.024 --> 01:28:17.814
Then you call it as a high
purity.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15146-0
01:28:18.104 --> 01:28:23.146
So what we need is that we need
a major to indicate that this is

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15146-1
01:28:23.146 --> 01:28:24.774
bad and this is good.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15161-0
01:28:25.544 --> 01:28:28.974
So we have 3 majors for the node
impurity.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15174-0
01:28:29.874 --> 01:28:33.145
So the three majors are Gini
index entropy and

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15174-1
01:28:33.145 --> 01:28:34.814
misclassification error.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15193-0
01:28:34.894 --> 01:28:39.182
So now let us see when we build
the decision tree, how do we go

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15193-1
01:28:39.182 --> 01:28:39.584
about?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15209-0
01:28:39.674 --> 01:28:43.132
The machine will go about
computing at each step to see am

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15209-1
01:28:43.132 --> 01:28:44.714
I going in right direction.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15221-0
01:28:46.824 --> 01:28:49.634
So what do we do with the
impurity measure?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15229-0
01:28:49.704 --> 01:28:51.894
So we measure the impurity.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15254-0
01:28:51.904 --> 01:28:57.325
Suppose that this is the data
and then the split will divide

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15254-1
01:28:57.325 --> 01:28:58.924
it into D1 and D2.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15290-0
01:28:59.514 --> 01:29:04.857
So we are going to measure the
impurity at this level D0I zero

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15290-1
01:29:04.857 --> 01:29:10.200
and then we measure the impurity
at this level and then we are

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15290-2
01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:12.744
going to see we are combining.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15308-0
01:29:12.754 --> 01:29:16.334
I-1 and I2 and we see how much
is it an improvement over IC?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15317-0
01:29:17.694 --> 01:29:19.594
OK, so that is the broad
concept.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15330-0
01:29:19.604 --> 01:29:22.744
So now let us see so so an
example.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15370-0
01:29:22.754 --> 01:29:27.935
Suppose that this is the data
that represents 2 classes C0C1

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15370-1
01:29:27.935 --> 01:29:33.456
and then we are going to have a
impurity of M0 at this level and

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15370-2
01:29:33.456 --> 01:29:36.004
then use attribute A to split.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15397-0
01:29:36.334 --> 01:29:40.507
We are going to get impurities
for both the nodes M1 and M2

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15397-1
01:29:40.507 --> 01:29:43.984
with the B we are getting 2
impurities M3 and M4.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15432-0
01:29:44.074 --> 01:29:48.767
So we are going to combine M1
and M2 and M12 and M3M4 and M3

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15432-1
01:29:48.767 --> 01:29:52.921
four and then we are going to
check which is a better

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15432-2
01:29:52.921 --> 01:29:53.844
improvement.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15442-0
01:29:55.904 --> 01:29:57.494
So we will see in an example.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15481-0
01:29:57.504 --> 01:30:02.321
So then you will understand the
point is that our intent is to

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15481-1
01:30:02.321 --> 01:30:07.291
check for impurity at each step
each level and then and then for

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15481-2
01:30:07.291 --> 01:30:11.114
each attribute we try with the
at the same level.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15505-0
01:30:11.124 --> 01:30:14.716
We try with various available
attributes and see whichever is

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15505-1
01:30:14.716 --> 01:30:18.134
giving an improvement in purity
that we are going to pick.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15519-0
01:30:18.824 --> 01:30:21.954
So now let us look for the
formula for Gini index.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15559-0
01:30:22.544 --> 01:30:28.539
Gini index is for any tuple when
there are multiple classes, so

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15559-1
01:30:28.539 --> 01:30:34.160
there are multiple classes class
J at node T So what is the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15559-2
01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:37.344
probability of class J at node
T?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15579-0
01:30:37.654 --> 01:30:41.941
So we are going to to consider
for all the classes the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15579-1
01:30:41.941 --> 01:30:45.604
probabilities and then we are
doing summation.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15586-0
01:30:50.544 --> 01:30:52.634
OK, for all the classes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15605-0
01:30:52.864 --> 01:30:57.224
So suppose that there are there
is a node with six tuples.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15612-0
01:31:05.724 --> 01:31:07.304
6 tuples in a note.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15628-0
01:31:10.514 --> 01:31:14.264
And suppose that class one is
zero, Class 2 is 6.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15650-0
01:31:14.514 --> 01:31:20.444
So we compute this 1 -, 0 ^2, -,
1, ^2, so that is equal to 0.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15671-0
01:31:21.094 --> 01:31:25.408
So in this case class one has
one tuple, Class 2 has five

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15671-1
01:31:25.408 --> 01:31:27.044
tuples, so we compute.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15687-0
01:31:27.054 --> 01:31:31.118
We get this when we have both
the classes are equal to pull we

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15687-1
01:31:31.118 --> 01:31:31.634
compute.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15698-0
01:31:31.644 --> 01:31:35.124
We are getting .5 so here is a
computation.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15715-0
01:31:36.934 --> 01:31:39.857
This is the computation that we
have shown in the previous

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15715-1
01:31:39.857 --> 01:31:40.154
slide.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15736-0
01:31:41.734 --> 01:31:48.089
So when it is 3 and three class
one and Class 2 then it is most

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15736-1
01:31:48.089 --> 01:31:48.784
impure.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15751-0
01:31:48.874 --> 01:31:54.594
OK, So what we'll be getting is
1 by 1, three by 6 square.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15767-0
01:32:02.524 --> 01:32:07.994
So this is giving an indication
of the impurity level.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15792-0
01:32:08.344 --> 01:32:13.473
So more the Jenny index, more
impure, the node is the smaller

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15792-1
01:32:13.473 --> 01:32:16.534
the Gini index, more pure than
ones.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15803-0
01:32:16.594 --> 01:32:18.874
So that is the understanding
that we can compute.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15822-0
01:32:18.914 --> 01:32:22.121
That is the conclusion we can do
and then machine needs some

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15822-1
01:32:22.121 --> 01:32:24.434
number crunching before it can
do anything.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15841-0
01:32:24.684 --> 01:32:27.490
So this can help the machine to
do the number crunching and

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15841-1
01:32:27.490 --> 01:32:29.314
proceed with the construction of
that.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15857-0
01:32:31.394 --> 01:32:35.444
So what do we do when we have
multiple nodes when we split?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15889-0
01:32:35.734 --> 01:32:41.362
So what we do is that when
suppose that we have a D0 and

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15889-1
01:32:41.362 --> 01:32:47.384
then we divide this into D1 and
then we divide this into D2.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15918-0
01:32:47.714 --> 01:32:54.856
So what we do is that at this
point we are saying that D1 size

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15918-1
01:32:54.856 --> 01:33:01.204
of the node, so and then Ginny
for the node divided by.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15932-0
01:33:03.064 --> 01:33:06.404
The entire data set, so it is D1
plus D2.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15950-0
01:33:08.624 --> 01:33:14.724
Bless D2 that is the size of the
D2 divided by the same thing.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15971-0
01:33:23.014 --> 01:33:28.940
So this is indicating the Gini
index of of these two nodes

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15971-1
01:33:28.940 --> 01:33:29.844
together.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15978-0
01:33:30.194 --> 01:33:31.174
After we do the split.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15988-0
01:33:32.504 --> 01:33:34.724
So let's look at the example.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/15994-0
01:33:34.734 --> 01:33:35.994
So that may help you.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16002-0
01:33:36.524 --> 01:33:38.354
Suppose that there is.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16009-0
01:33:38.364 --> 01:33:40.004
At this point there are 12
tuples.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16036-0
01:33:44.384 --> 01:33:47.834
And the Gini value is 0.5
because there are six tuples of

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16036-1
01:33:47.834 --> 01:33:50.034
class one and six tuples of
Class 2.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16063-0
01:33:50.404 --> 01:33:54.917
So we split on this attribute
and node N one got 5 tuples of

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16063-1
01:33:54.917 --> 01:33:57.654
class one and two tuples of
Class 2.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16081-0
01:33:58.044 --> 01:34:01.594
Node N 2 got one tuple of class
one and four tuples of Class 2.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16103-0
01:34:01.914 --> 01:34:07.214
So Ginnie for node one is 1 -, 5
by 7, ^2 -, 2 by 7 squared.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16117-0
01:34:07.224 --> 01:34:10.644
So you can see so this is for
the node one.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16121-0
01:34:10.974 --> 01:34:12.434
This is for the node 2.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16147-0
01:34:14.394 --> 01:34:18.681
And we combine them using the
weighted summation because the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16147-1
01:34:18.681 --> 01:34:21.914
node one got 7 tuples, node two
got 5 tuples.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16153-0
01:34:22.094 --> 01:34:24.094
So this is the weighted
summation.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16163-0
01:34:37.964 --> 01:34:39.114
So what is the gain?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16167-0
01:34:40.844 --> 01:34:41.804
The Guineas.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16177-0
01:34:43.454 --> 01:34:45.994
.5 -, .37.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16188-0
01:34:46.804 --> 01:34:49.134
So this is a gain of .13.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16205-0
01:34:49.304 --> 01:34:52.824
So if you have more attributes
so the machine can compute for

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16205-1
01:34:52.824 --> 01:34:54.754
each attribute, what is the
gain?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16215-0
01:34:55.284 --> 01:34:58.484
And then choose the attribute
that gives the greatest gain.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16228-0
01:35:03.304 --> 01:35:06.864
So now let us look at some
examples.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16241-0
01:35:06.874 --> 01:35:10.344
Some more examples, just to see
what is how it is working.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16248-0
01:35:10.814 --> 01:35:13.024
So we are doing here.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16269-0
01:35:13.154 --> 01:35:19.474
Previously, we had a Jenny of
C1C2 or four and six, right.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16277-0
01:35:20.214 --> 01:35:22.364
So this is four and six.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16279-0
01:35:22.424 --> 01:35:22.884
OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16289-0
01:35:22.984 --> 01:35:26.774
So previously we had set in
Jeannie value G0.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16311-0
01:35:27.194 --> 01:35:32.166
So now after doing a split we
are getting this here this here

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16311-1
01:35:32.166 --> 01:35:35.854
and this year and this has the
greatest gain.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16339-0
01:35:43.154 --> 01:35:48.192
But then but then we will also
look later on saying that this

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16339-1
01:35:48.192 --> 01:35:53.474
is giving you more gain, but it
is creating a more complex tree.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16359-0
01:36:00.024 --> 01:36:04.233
Because the tree at this point
has three paths and these these

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16359-1
01:36:04.233 --> 01:36:06.504
are providing less complex
trees.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16371-0
01:36:08.464 --> 01:36:10.124
So we'll come to that little
later.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16378-0
01:36:11.084 --> 01:36:13.474
So that will be another
consideration.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16381-0
01:36:13.484 --> 01:36:14.094
We'll see.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16394-0
01:36:14.224 --> 01:36:17.184
So between these two this is
better right?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16398-0
01:36:18.214 --> 01:36:19.594
Between these two, this is
better.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16419-0
01:36:25.354 --> 01:36:29.734
OK, so now let us see what do we
do with continuous act review.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16425-0
01:36:29.774 --> 01:36:31.724
I hope people are clear so far.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16495-0
01:36:34.364 --> 01:36:39.292
Sir uh, is it like uh algorithm
internally calculates Gini index

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16434-0
01:36:34.674 --> 01:36:34.914
OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16495-1
01:36:39.292 --> 01:36:43.613
for each and every attributes
and come with a conclusion

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16475-0
01:36:42.544 --> 01:36:45.324
Yes, yes, yes, yes, that is
correct that is.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16495-2
01:36:43.613 --> 01:36:48.010
without without we doing it
manually or the those things,

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16481-0
01:36:47.634 --> 01:36:47.894
Yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16498-0
01:36:47.904 --> 01:36:50.144
Yeah, obviously that is what is
the machine learning is.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16495-3
01:36:48.010 --> 01:36:48.464
right?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16534-0
01:36:50.154 --> 01:36:53.698
So the we are looking at one of
the machine learning algorithms,

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16534-1
01:36:53.698 --> 01:36:56.806
so the machine learning
algorithm is that it is going to

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16529-0
01:36:54.204 --> 01:36:56.114
So maybe maybe.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16534-2
01:36:56.806 --> 01:36:59.804
create a decision tree given a
data and training data.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16543-0
01:36:59.854 --> 01:37:02.344
So we are seeing how to write
the algorithm.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16548-0
01:37:03.894 --> 01:37:04.204
OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16552-0
01:37:04.214 --> 01:37:05.844
So, OK, so Sir, maybe.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16567-0
01:37:05.854 --> 01:37:09.898
Uh in machine may come up with
some conclusion which may not be

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16567-1
01:37:09.898 --> 01:37:10.024
a.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16583-0
01:37:11.854 --> 01:37:15.024
Means which may not be concluded
by normal human being.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16607-0
01:37:15.034 --> 01:37:17.184
So in that case, we will, we'll
discard that model.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16599-0
01:37:15.734 --> 01:37:16.404
No, no, no, no.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16602-0
01:37:16.414 --> 01:37:18.284
Just, no, no.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16618-0
01:37:18.294 --> 01:37:21.944
Look at this, Mr Vinay, the
machine is doing what you said.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16640-0
01:37:22.334 --> 01:37:25.061
So obviously you have to change
your algorithm if you think that

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16640-1
01:37:25.061 --> 01:37:26.864
the results of the algorithm are
not good.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16652-0
01:37:26.874 --> 01:37:28.414
So it is like any other
algorithm.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16687-0
01:37:28.774 --> 01:37:32.348
So machine learning is actually
we give a name because uh, OK,

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16659-0
01:37:28.924 --> 01:37:29.254
Got it.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16687-1
01:37:32.348 --> 01:37:35.638
the name is established, so we
can't question it, but the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16687-2
01:37:35.638 --> 01:37:38.304
algorithm is still written by
somebody either.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16722-0
01:37:38.394 --> 01:37:41.565
So maybe in Python there are
many libraries that people had

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16722-1
01:37:41.565 --> 01:37:44.840
already built, so you you will
feel that things are happening

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16722-2
01:37:44.840 --> 01:37:45.844
without your doing.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16736-0
01:37:45.854 --> 01:37:49.029
But somebody has programmed,
somebody has programmed it and

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16734-0
01:37:46.424 --> 01:37:48.154
Yeah, yes, yes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16736-1
01:37:49.029 --> 01:37:50.034
you are using that.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16776-0
01:37:50.114 --> 01:37:53.281
But if you think that you are
not satisfied, for example your

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16776-1
01:37:53.281 --> 01:37:55.989
you have a very specific
requirements and you're not

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16776-2
01:37:55.989 --> 01:37:59.104
happy with the library, you can
write this nothing stopping.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16800-0
01:37:59.454 --> 01:38:03.067
So you can write the algorithms
are not that complex, so given

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16800-1
01:38:03.067 --> 01:38:06.221
some one week time, you can
certainly write a good new

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16800-2
01:38:06.221 --> 01:38:06.794
algorithm.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16804-0
01:38:09.664 --> 01:38:10.044
Thanks Sir.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16825-0
01:38:12.324 --> 01:38:16.632
OK, so now let us see what to do
with a continuous attribute

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16825-1
01:38:16.632 --> 01:38:18.114
continuous attribute.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16835-0
01:38:18.124 --> 01:38:23.024
We are seeing that we can take
multiple choices, no.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16846-0
01:38:23.044 --> 01:38:24.954
So we can do a splitting.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16887-0
01:38:25.124 --> 01:38:29.063
We can do a multi splitting or
we we can do a two way splitting

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16887-1
01:38:29.063 --> 01:38:32.448
and if we it is a two way
splitting which is the point

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16887-2
01:38:32.448 --> 01:38:34.294
where you should do the split.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16905-0
01:38:34.594 --> 01:38:39.634
OK, So what we can do is this or
what the machine can do is this.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16915-0
01:38:39.644 --> 01:38:42.254
So essentially we have to
program the machine to do this.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16936-0
01:38:42.704 --> 01:38:47.827
So what the machine, what we can
do is that we can constantly

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16936-1
01:38:47.827 --> 01:38:50.884
keep increasing the the split
point.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16938-0
01:38:51.694 --> 01:38:52.374
Keep trying.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16945-0
01:39:08.644 --> 01:39:09.534
So here.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16947-0
01:39:09.544 --> 01:39:10.094
What?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16950-0
01:39:10.264 --> 01:39:10.854
What is?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16996-0
01:39:10.864 --> 01:39:19.008
What is happening is that we are
trying the split .1 is at 55 OK

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/16996-1
01:39:19.008 --> 01:39:25.774
one is 657280879297 hundred 1000
twenty 272 and 2:30.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17009-0
01:39:26.124 --> 01:39:28.444
So we found all the split
points.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17030-0
01:39:28.454 --> 01:39:33.772
We tried all of them and we see
that the best split is occurring

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17030-1
01:39:33.772 --> 01:39:35.244
when we choose 97.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17047-0
01:39:36.644 --> 01:39:42.904
So we are getting a lowest Gini
value when the split is at 97.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17050-0
01:39:43.894 --> 01:39:45.074
So on this data.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17066-0
01:39:47.324 --> 01:39:48.954
How did we choose this split
point?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17074-0
01:39:49.084 --> 01:39:49.744
Or I missed that?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17130-0
01:39:50.554 --> 01:39:55.272
So we are trying, we are just
trying so that so look at this

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17092-0
01:39:53.254 --> 01:39:53.874
Just randomly.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17130-1
01:39:55.272 --> 01:39:59.680
97 we took you see that six
tuples are below 97 and four

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17130-2
01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:04.630
tuples are above 97 and out of
the six tuples that are below 97

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17130-3
01:40:04.630 --> 01:40:05.944
this is 97 right?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17146-0
01:40:06.874 --> 01:40:15.044
6 tuples below 97 or but this
this, this, this and this.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17197-0
01:40:15.284 --> 01:40:21.968
So am I missing something 123456
so out of this we are seeing

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17197-1
01:40:21.968 --> 01:40:28.004
that 6 tuples and they are
breaking into three wise and

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17197-2
01:40:28.004 --> 01:40:34.472
three N's and then other four
are breaking into simply four

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17197-3
01:40:34.472 --> 01:40:36.304
ends and three Y.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17201-0
01:40:36.664 --> 01:40:37.774
Sorry zero wise.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17237-0
01:40:38.294 --> 01:40:42.023
So when you compute the genie
for this and this together, and

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17237-1
01:40:42.023 --> 01:40:45.631
we'll combine this, So what you
are getting is that you are

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17237-2
01:40:45.631 --> 01:40:47.314
getting a lowest value here.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17246-0
01:40:47.564 --> 01:40:49.804
In all other cases, you're not
getting that good.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17253-0
01:40:49.884 --> 01:40:50.024
When?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17263-0
01:40:58.074 --> 01:41:01.184
So what are we computing out of
this genie index?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17286-0
01:41:01.194 --> 01:41:05.564
Or means if we say like here the
Gini index is .3, what are we

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17286-1
01:41:05.564 --> 01:41:06.674
concluding here?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17343-0
01:41:07.514 --> 01:41:11.655
So what we are saying is that if
you want to use the taxable

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17343-1
01:41:11.655 --> 01:41:15.796
income as the attribute, so
taxable income as the attribute,

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17343-2
01:41:15.796 --> 01:41:20.005
so you split saying that less
than 97 on one side and greater

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17343-3
01:41:20.005 --> 01:41:24.146
than 97 on the other, and then
you are going to get a better

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17662-0
01:41:20.114 --> 01:41:20.324
Umm.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17343-4
01:41:24.146 --> 01:41:26.454
tree or a better quality
results.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17364-0
01:41:29.134 --> 01:41:32.148
If you choose the income, but
you can also choose the other

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17364-1
01:41:32.148 --> 01:41:33.704
attributes and you do the same.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17379-0
01:41:33.874 --> 01:41:37.484
So here you are saying that the
gain you are getting is .3.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17414-0
01:41:37.934 --> 01:41:43.659
Sorry, the Gini is impurity left
in the data is .3 but but the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17414-1
01:41:43.659 --> 01:41:49.111
other others also you can try
and if you if the impurity is

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17414-2
01:41:49.111 --> 01:41:50.564
further reduced.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17433-0
01:41:51.034 --> 01:41:53.947
Sorry, the purity is further
enhanced or the impurity is

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17433-1
01:41:53.947 --> 01:41:54.764
further reduced.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17448-0
01:41:55.214 --> 01:41:58.000
Then you can go for the other
attributes, but the with this

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17448-1
01:41:58.000 --> 01:41:58.464
attribute.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17470-0
01:41:58.474 --> 01:42:01.858
What we are saying is that it is
not so easy, so we needed to try

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17470-1
01:42:01.858 --> 01:42:03.704
many combinations and
permutations.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17474-0
01:42:03.784 --> 01:42:04.394
Permutations.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17495-0
01:42:04.404 --> 01:42:08.371
Before we could identify 97 but
for categorical attributes, we

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17495-1
01:42:08.371 --> 01:42:10.764
could see that it is relatively
easy.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17518-0
01:42:11.254 --> 01:42:14.646
In this case, we are finding
that this is the best right if

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17518-1
01:42:14.646 --> 01:42:16.454
we want to go for two way split.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17529-0
01:42:16.774 --> 01:42:19.194
If we are ready for multiway
split, this is the best.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17547-0
01:42:22.374 --> 01:42:25.761
So uh, this gin index makes the
model more accurate and more

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17547-1
01:42:25.761 --> 01:42:26.594
confident than.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17584-0
01:42:28.294 --> 01:42:32.078
Yes, because finally the point
is that how do you explain it to

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17584-1
01:42:32.078 --> 01:42:35.565
the machine they there is no way
you can explain it to the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17584-2
01:42:35.565 --> 01:42:38.284
machine except by the help of
numbers, right?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17613-0
01:42:40.604 --> 01:42:44.803
So if you are saying that there
is 2 attributes, marital status

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17595-0
01:42:41.344 --> 01:42:41.494
Yes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17613-1
01:42:44.803 --> 01:42:48.214
and refund, how will you explain
it to the machine?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17622-0
01:42:48.224 --> 01:42:51.094
You have to break it down into
numbers.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17633-0
01:42:51.104 --> 01:42:55.054
Then the machine is more more
inclined to do the job right?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17645-0
01:42:55.464 --> 01:42:57.874
Or the machine is becomes
capable of doing the job.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17661-0
01:42:57.944 --> 01:42:59.833
There is nothing like
inclination for emission, but

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17661-1
01:42:59.833 --> 01:43:01.394
the machine becomes capable of
doing this.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17679-0
01:43:05.614 --> 01:43:07.544
Is there are we supposed to
calculate these?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17682-0
01:43:05.964 --> 01:43:06.254
Yep.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17718-0
01:43:07.554 --> 01:43:13.076
Uh Gini index, and then do some
calculations are based upon that

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17718-1
01:43:13.076 --> 01:43:15.964
numerical be given as a
question.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17703-0
01:43:14.764 --> 01:43:15.394
Why not?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17709-0
01:43:15.404 --> 01:43:15.814
Why not?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17716-0
01:43:15.824 --> 01:43:17.274
If required, you can do that
right?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17725-0
01:43:17.284 --> 01:43:19.244
Because we have shown all the
calculations.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17732-0
01:43:19.254 --> 01:43:19.974
So what is the?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17741-0
01:43:20.214 --> 01:43:22.644
So it is so.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17770-0
01:43:23.294 --> 01:43:27.884
Uh, so I just one thing, so
lower like lower the Guinea

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17770-1
01:43:27.884 --> 01:43:30.424
index, then lower the impurity.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17778-0
01:43:29.984 --> 01:43:32.614
The purer the node, the purer
the node.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17776-0
01:43:31.434 --> 01:43:32.524
This also concludes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17788-0
01:43:32.944 --> 01:43:33.104
Yes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17802-0
01:43:34.474 --> 01:43:37.164
That means where we split it
that the correct correct.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17801-0
01:43:34.674 --> 01:43:35.824
And we want beautiful.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17800-0
01:43:34.874 --> 01:43:35.344
OK, Sir.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17817-0
01:43:38.984 --> 01:43:40.574
We split it by the correct.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17820-0
01:43:41.264 --> 01:43:41.654
Yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17827-0
01:43:41.424 --> 01:43:41.984
What should I say?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17829-0
01:43:41.664 --> 01:43:43.874
Yes, Mr Rumic actually correct.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17835-0
01:43:43.884 --> 01:43:45.414
Maybe a difficult point.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17859-0
01:43:45.424 --> 01:43:48.994
So let me go back to the basics
of what we, no, no, no, no.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17864-0
01:43:46.764 --> 01:43:47.904
Or maybe better, I would say.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17876-0
01:43:49.004 --> 01:43:53.514
Let me let me I think I I never
possibly explain to you.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17898-0
01:43:53.524 --> 01:43:57.270
Have I explained to you the
concept of the all the data

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17898-1
01:43:57.270 --> 01:44:00.614
science or the machine learning
we are going for?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17908-0
01:44:00.624 --> 01:44:03.154
What is known as a P AC?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17911-0
01:44:03.384 --> 01:44:04.964
So which is probably.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17914-0
01:44:07.664 --> 01:44:08.674
Approximately.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17918-0
01:44:12.394 --> 01:44:13.174
Correct answer.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17932-0
01:44:15.274 --> 01:44:19.784
So so you cannot say that you
got it absolutely right.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17965-0
01:44:19.854 --> 01:44:23.790
So for example, we have
discussed about how many, many

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17965-1
01:44:23.790 --> 01:44:28.369
experts sit together and do all
the statistics and data science

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/17965-2
01:44:28.369 --> 01:44:32.304
and finally end up getting the
election results wrong.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18023-0
01:44:32.634 --> 01:44:36.471
So the point is that you you can
only try based on the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18023-1
01:44:36.471 --> 01:44:40.727
probability and approximation
some value because the you are

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18023-2
01:44:40.727 --> 01:44:44.773
never because data science is
you're dealing with a large

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18023-3
01:44:44.773 --> 01:44:49.169
volumes of data, so you cannot
go to the individual tuples and

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18023-4
01:44:49.169 --> 01:44:50.424
start fixing them.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18061-0
01:44:50.664 --> 01:44:56.104
So you were effort is to be more
to higher probability and higher

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18061-1
01:44:56.104 --> 01:45:01.461
accuracy rather than saying that
I'm right I have I clarified it

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18061-2
01:45:01.461 --> 01:45:02.614
little better.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18070-0
01:45:02.434 --> 01:45:03.394
Yes, yes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18063-0
01:45:03.704 --> 01:45:04.074
Yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18079-0
01:45:04.114 --> 01:45:07.504
So because this is considered as
a the science of probability and

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18079-1
01:45:07.504 --> 01:45:08.274
approximations.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18092-0
01:45:12.504 --> 01:45:17.074
So now let us look at a
alternate splitting criteria.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18102-0
01:45:17.264 --> 01:45:20.524
So, so now let me let me remove
these things.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18108-0
01:45:24.734 --> 01:45:25.144
Yes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18120-0
01:45:25.314 --> 01:45:29.474
So Alton, this is an alternate
tool, 2 Gini index.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18132-0
01:45:29.484 --> 01:45:33.634
This is called entropy, so
entropy works like this.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18153-0
01:45:33.644 --> 01:45:39.354
So you consider the probability
of each class and multiply it by

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18153-1
01:45:39.354 --> 01:45:40.584
multiplied by.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18158-0
01:45:40.594 --> 01:45:42.144
Something is missed out here.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18167-0
01:45:42.194 --> 01:45:43.874
Log of to the base of two.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18200-0
01:45:44.724 --> 01:45:49.690
So so you we take the
probability and then multiply it

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18200-1
01:45:49.690 --> 01:45:55.377
by the log of the base log to
the base of two, the probability

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18200-2
01:45:55.377 --> 01:45:57.814
and then the overall value.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18208-0
01:45:57.824 --> 01:45:59.454
We are going to put a negative
sign.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18216-0
01:45:59.464 --> 01:46:00.634
Why do we put the negative sign?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18244-0
01:46:00.644 --> 01:46:03.832
Because log of the numbers
greater than one is negative, so

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18244-1
01:46:03.832 --> 01:46:06.966
the probability is always less
than one, so you always get

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18244-2
01:46:06.966 --> 01:46:07.444
negative.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18272-0
01:46:07.664 --> 01:46:11.542
So by adding a minus we are
making sure that the entropy

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18272-1
01:46:11.542 --> 01:46:15.352
turns out to be positive and
entropy is also a major of

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18272-2
01:46:15.352 --> 01:46:15.964
impurity.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18282-0
01:46:16.394 --> 01:46:19.804
The lower the entropy, the
better the nodes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18300-0
01:46:19.814 --> 01:46:23.556
So like the Gini index, this is
also indicating the impurity

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18300-1
01:46:23.556 --> 01:46:23.924
level.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18335-0
01:46:25.254 --> 01:46:29.789
So what can be the range of
values in this case it can be

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18335-1
01:46:29.789 --> 01:46:34.714
the maximum value can be log NC
which is the number of classes

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18335-2
01:46:34.714 --> 01:46:36.824
and the minimum value is 0.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18346-0
01:46:36.834 --> 01:46:39.674
So now let us again compute with
some examples.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18354-0
01:46:39.684 --> 01:46:42.084
So you will be able to relate.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18363-0
01:46:42.234 --> 01:46:45.024
So suppose that we take this
example.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18369-0
01:46:45.074 --> 01:46:45.404
OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18376-0
01:46:45.654 --> 01:46:49.344
So C1 is 0 and C2 is 6.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18382-0
01:46:49.534 --> 01:46:50.824
So what are we saying?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18414-0
01:46:51.014 --> 01:46:58.564
So the probability of Class 1
multiplied by log to the base 2.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18423-0
01:46:58.714 --> 01:47:05.114
The probability of class one
bless probability of Class 2

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18423-1
01:47:05.114 --> 01:47:12.064
multiplied by log to the base
two of probability of class two.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18457-0
01:47:12.264 --> 01:47:17.055
OK, so this is class one is 0,
so whatever you multiply this

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18457-1
01:47:17.055 --> 01:47:21.924
with, this comes out as zero
though log log 20 is actually is

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18457-2
01:47:21.924 --> 01:47:23.494
considered Infinity.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18479-0
01:47:23.684 --> 01:47:27.470
But then when you compute this
as, it tends to 0, this comes

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18479-1
01:47:27.470 --> 01:47:28.214
out as zero.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18486-0
01:47:28.764 --> 01:47:32.164
Then probability of Class 2 is
1, right?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18502-0
01:47:32.554 --> 01:47:36.844
This is equal to 1 C two is
probability of Class 2 is 1.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18518-0
01:47:37.034 --> 01:47:41.601
So log to the base two of
probability of Class 2 each

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18518-1
01:47:41.601 --> 01:47:42.024
zero.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18542-0
01:47:42.334 --> 01:47:48.674
So log two of one is 0 so that
way the entropy for both of them

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18542-1
01:47:48.674 --> 01:47:51.844
put together will come out at 0.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18565-0
01:47:51.934 --> 01:47:56.421
So this indicates that the
impurity levels are zero, so

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18565-1
01:47:56.421 --> 01:47:59.144
there is no impurity in the
node.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18583-0
01:47:59.824 --> 01:48:03.794
So once we go for others, so we
compute in the same way.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18606-0
01:48:03.864 --> 01:48:11.275
So PC1 is 1 by 6 and log of base
two of 1 by 6 and then this is

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18606-1
01:48:11.275 --> 01:48:11.854
PC-2.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18609-0
01:48:11.864 --> 01:48:13.354
Is this so?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18616-0
01:48:13.364 --> 01:48:14.484
How do you compute this?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18625-0
01:48:14.494 --> 01:48:18.244
So maybe I will help you with
the calculator.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18640-0
01:48:20.204 --> 01:48:23.294
So, so now let us do the
calculation.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18654-0
01:48:23.304 --> 01:48:25.144
So no so.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18690-0
01:48:24.774 --> 01:48:29.659
It said it said here I have one
question that whatever the class

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18666-0
01:48:28.484 --> 01:48:28.644
Yes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18690-1
01:48:29.659 --> 01:48:33.867
we are taking C1C2 do can we
have that overlapping data

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18678-0
01:48:30.454 --> 01:48:30.694
Hmm.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18690-2
01:48:33.867 --> 01:48:35.294
overlapping tuples?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18692-0
01:48:34.814 --> 01:48:36.664
Or no.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18705-0
01:48:36.674 --> 01:48:36.924
No.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18712-0
01:48:36.934 --> 01:48:39.628
You are saying that something in
both class one and Class 2? Is

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18717-0
01:48:39.194 --> 01:48:40.594
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18712-1
01:48:39.628 --> 01:48:39.754
it?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18718-0
01:48:40.684 --> 01:48:41.294
No, no, no.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18733-0
01:48:41.304 --> 01:48:45.876
When training data, you expect
the training data to have that

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18733-1
01:48:45.876 --> 01:48:46.244
type.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18757-0
01:48:46.254 --> 01:48:49.454
That much of clarity, so it is
with the test data that you

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18757-1
01:48:49.454 --> 01:48:51.894
don't know, but in the training
data itself.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18769-0
01:48:51.904 --> 01:48:55.763
If you don't know the class,
then really that cannot help

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18769-1
01:48:55.763 --> 01:48:56.494
you, right?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18781-0
01:48:58.204 --> 01:48:59.184
OK, OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18785-0
01:48:59.354 --> 01:49:02.044
For each of the training to pull
your expected to.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18806-0
01:49:02.174 --> 01:49:08.955
So now let us look at how to
compute for the so so the this

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18806-1
01:49:08.955 --> 01:49:10.424
is like this.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18832-0
01:49:10.494 --> 01:49:18.684
So run by 6 multiplied by log 21
by 6, so 1 by 6 is .166 right

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18832-1
01:49:18.684 --> 01:49:20.504
and then .166.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18852-0
01:49:20.514 --> 01:49:24.099
How do we compute the log of
base two and hoping that some of

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18852-1
01:49:24.099 --> 01:49:25.024
MU may not know?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18882-0
01:49:25.034 --> 01:49:28.403
That is why I'm treating because
in the calculator there is only

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18882-1
01:49:28.403 --> 01:49:31.304
log, so this will give you the
log with the base of 10.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18896-0
01:49:31.694 --> 01:49:37.794
You need to divide this by log
of to the base of two.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18922-0
01:49:38.144 --> 01:49:45.118
That will give you the log with
the base of two, so this minus

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18922-1
01:49:45.118 --> 01:49:47.774
2.59 is log 2 of 1 by 6.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18929-0
01:49:48.714 --> 01:49:49.344
So.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18938-0
01:49:49.404 --> 01:49:56.154
So let me let me put this here
minus 2.59 right.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18955-0
01:50:00.114 --> 01:50:06.964
So I'm talking about minus 2.59
and similarly we can do for the.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18959-0
01:50:09.064 --> 01:50:09.514
Uh.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18964-0
01:50:09.524 --> 01:50:11.154
The five by six.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/18975-0
01:50:11.584 --> 01:50:13.724
5 by 6 is .833 right?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19006-0
01:50:14.834 --> 01:50:19.619
So we need to do it with the
same way 833 and then we take

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19006-1
01:50:19.619 --> 01:50:23.754
the log of that and then divide
it by the two log.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19014-0
01:50:24.664 --> 01:50:27.674
So that will be minus .26.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19018-0
01:50:28.874 --> 01:50:30.884
OK, so this is.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19025-0
01:50:35.564 --> 01:50:37.714
Minus .26, right.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19043-0
01:50:37.944 --> 01:50:43.754
So now we compute this so it is
1 by 6 of 2.59.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19071-0
01:50:44.484 --> 01:50:49.149
So whole minus is taken out
because this is minus and the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19071-1
01:50:49.149 --> 01:50:53.894
whole the entropy sign itself as
minus plus 5 by 6 of .26.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19074-0
01:50:53.954 --> 01:50:54.234
Thanks.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19081-0
01:50:55.994 --> 01:50:56.984
So you compute this.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19091-0
01:50:56.994 --> 01:51:01.864
This comes to .43 and this comes
to.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19103-0
01:51:05.584 --> 01:51:07.654
This comes to about .22.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19135-0
01:51:09.364 --> 01:51:15.477
This is equal to 0.65, so
whenever so essentially all I'm

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19135-1
01:51:15.477 --> 01:51:21.695
saying is that the log 2P is
equal to log of be divided by

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19135-2
01:51:21.695 --> 01:51:22.854
log of two.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19158-0
01:51:23.624 --> 01:51:27.151
So so this is a because many of
the calculators will not have

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19158-1
01:51:27.151 --> 01:51:29.654
direct computation for log of
the base two.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19167-0
01:51:30.184 --> 01:51:32.244
So you need to use this formula
to compute.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19185-0
01:51:34.814 --> 01:51:39.774
And also just one doubt minus
2.59.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19181-0
01:51:35.144 --> 01:51:37.014
So the yes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19201-0
01:51:39.824 --> 01:51:45.004
Sorry, we're minus 2.59 and the
last previous slide.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19199-0
01:51:42.834 --> 01:51:42.974
Yes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19212-0
01:51:45.064 --> 01:51:47.114
That calculus and I just wanted
to check it out.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19218-0
01:51:49.244 --> 01:51:50.374
Ohh, who is speaking?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19228-0
01:51:50.444 --> 01:51:50.814
I'm not.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19235-0
01:51:50.724 --> 01:51:51.574
Sort of sort of here.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19231-0
01:51:52.034 --> 01:51:52.284
Yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19233-0
01:51:52.294 --> 01:51:52.904
Mr Saurav?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19238-0
01:51:52.914 --> 01:51:53.424
Yes, yes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19261-0
01:51:53.434 --> 01:51:57.777
OK, so you want to know that the
what is that you want to know

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19259-0
01:51:54.204 --> 01:51:54.664
So this.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19261-1
01:51:57.777 --> 01:51:58.604
you want to.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19269-0
01:51:58.584 --> 01:51:59.104
Yeah, yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19276-0
01:51:58.664 --> 01:52:00.094
You want me to go to the
calculator?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19287-0
01:52:00.924 --> 01:52:02.974
No, no, that I have done the
calculation.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19301-0
01:52:02.984 --> 01:52:05.284
I just wanted to listen.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19285-0
01:52:03.034 --> 01:52:03.324
Yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19289-0
01:52:03.334 --> 01:52:03.524
Yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19324-0
01:52:03.534 --> 01:52:08.317
OK, so it is log of the base two
log with the base two you 21 by

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19324-1
01:52:08.317 --> 01:52:11.554
6, one by six is approximately
.167, right?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19347-0
01:52:11.914 --> 01:52:16.134
That is what I directly used and
then you multiply it by 1 by 6.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19343-0
01:52:14.334 --> 01:52:15.294
Yeah. So.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19353-0
01:52:16.924 --> 01:52:18.054
So this is the formula.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19359-0
01:52:17.504 --> 01:52:17.664
Yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19364-0
01:52:18.224 --> 01:52:19.844
Can see the formula right on the
screen.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19368-0
01:52:21.164 --> 01:52:21.854
Yeah, Rao, Sir.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19397-0
01:52:21.864 --> 01:52:27.800
I just wanted to I my doubt is
that minus sign was there that

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19397-1
01:52:27.800 --> 01:52:32.204
you know that you know it it has
disappeared.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19416-0
01:52:32.974 --> 01:52:36.761
Yeah, because that is see in the
formula in the formula, entropy

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19407-0
01:52:33.214 --> 01:52:33.894
I'm just trying.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19416-1
01:52:36.761 --> 01:52:37.984
has an overall minus.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19446-0
01:52:38.494 --> 01:52:41.487
You can see that entropy formula
that minus and this man is

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19428-0
01:52:39.294 --> 01:52:40.004
OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19455-0
01:52:40.554 --> 01:52:44.474
Ah, that's the reason Aug got
it, yes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19446-1
01:52:41.487 --> 01:52:42.384
getting cancelled.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19466-0
01:52:42.494 --> 01:52:42.654
Yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19481-0
01:52:44.234 --> 01:52:47.604
Yeah, I explained to you in the
earlier saying that because the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19481-1
01:52:47.604 --> 01:52:50.500
probabilities all the
probabilities are less than one,

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19481-2
01:52:50.500 --> 01:52:52.764
so the logarithm of them are
always minus.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19506-0
01:52:52.774 --> 01:52:55.501
So that is why we keep a
additional minus so that the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19506-1
01:52:55.501 --> 01:52:56.864
entropy is always positive.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19501-0
01:52:57.554 --> 01:52:58.424
Got it, got it.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19504-0
01:52:58.434 --> 01:52:58.744
Got it.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19509-0
01:52:58.754 --> 01:52:59.324
Thank you, Rosa.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19514-0
01:52:59.334 --> 01:52:59.714
Thank you.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19529-0
01:53:00.654 --> 01:53:04.128
OK, so now we can have another
criteria which is the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19529-1
01:53:04.128 --> 01:53:05.504
classification error.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19537-0
01:53:05.834 --> 01:53:07.244
So it works like this.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19572-0
01:53:07.254 --> 01:53:12.173
So what you do is that the you
compute the classification error

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19572-1
01:53:12.173 --> 01:53:16.707
as one minus maximum of the
probability of all the classes

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19572-2
01:53:16.707 --> 01:53:18.474
together for that tool.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19578-0
01:53:18.554 --> 01:53:19.744
So it is.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19583-0
01:53:19.814 --> 01:53:21.224
It is a simpler calculation.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19599-0
01:53:21.234 --> 01:53:24.892
So what we are doing is so we
have two probabilities here,

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19599-1
01:53:24.892 --> 01:53:25.264
right?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19606-0
01:53:25.354 --> 01:53:27.554
We have two probabilities, 1
needs 0.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19624-0
01:53:30.074 --> 01:53:34.904
Maximum of zero and one we take
and we subtract it from the one.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19631-0
01:53:35.114 --> 01:53:36.484
So we are getting a 0.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19639-0
01:53:36.594 --> 01:53:40.304
So this is again the
classification error.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19653-0
01:53:40.314 --> 01:53:42.984
We call this as a classification
error which is coming here.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19670-0
01:53:43.354 --> 01:53:47.953
So in this case, what is this
one minus Max of 1 by 6 and five

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19670-1
01:53:47.953 --> 01:53:48.464
by six?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19710-0
01:53:48.694 --> 01:53:52.234
5 by 6 is maximum, so you
subtract this and you're getting

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19710-1
01:53:52.234 --> 01:53:56.074
value of 1 by 6 and in this case
you're getting a value of 2 by

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19710-2
01:53:56.074 --> 01:53:57.454
6, which is 1 by three.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19730-0
01:53:57.824 --> 01:54:02.420
So this can be another way in
which the machine can compute

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19730-1
01:54:02.420 --> 01:54:04.794
the impurity level in the node.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19744-0
01:54:05.204 --> 01:54:08.014
Again, it is saying that the
impurity level here is 0.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19770-0
01:54:08.164 --> 01:54:11.134
In this case it is 1 by 6 and in
this case it is 1 by.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19776-0
01:54:11.644 --> 01:54:13.914
And also here we are saying
error.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19786-0
01:54:14.304 --> 01:54:17.654
Does it mean that we are not
getting complete purity?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19794-0
01:54:17.664 --> 01:54:18.734
That's why we are saying error.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19798-0
01:54:20.014 --> 01:54:20.904
Yes, that is right.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19826-0
01:54:20.914 --> 01:54:25.258
Now see in this node we are
saying that the class is 2/6

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19826-1
01:54:25.258 --> 01:54:27.544
tuples are there in this node.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19833-0
01:54:27.594 --> 01:54:29.334
I'm looking at the third bottom
node.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19860-0
01:54:29.434 --> 01:54:33.709
OK, bottom node 6 tuples are
there 1/2, class one has got 2

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19860-1
01:54:33.709 --> 01:54:36.344
tuples and Class 2 has got 4
tuples.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19866-0
01:54:36.354 --> 01:54:37.554
Obviously it is not pure, right?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19881-0
01:54:39.764 --> 01:54:40.104
Yes, yes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19884-0
01:54:40.074 --> 01:54:42.294
So he say that impurity level is
1 by 3.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19899-0
01:54:44.074 --> 01:54:46.744
So why are we using term
computing error?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19896-0
01:54:44.624 --> 01:54:44.944
Use.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19914-0
01:54:47.014 --> 01:54:48.954
So that's what I'm confused
little bit.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19924-0
01:54:49.064 --> 01:54:51.750
OK, OK, this is computing error
is actually this is a

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19924-1
01:54:51.750 --> 01:54:52.794
classification error.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19929-0
01:54:52.864 --> 01:54:53.274
OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19934-0
01:54:53.544 --> 01:54:54.464
So we call this.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19948-0
01:54:55.444 --> 01:54:59.030
This is the classification
error, so maybe maybe here

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19948-1
01:54:59.030 --> 01:54:59.694
computing.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20020-0
01:54:59.704 --> 01:55:03.225
In this case I should put here
classification error, but

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20020-1
01:55:03.225 --> 01:55:07.116
sometimes people put the people
use a simple term saying that,

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19966-0
01:55:03.964 --> 01:55:04.444
OK. Yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20020-2
01:55:07.116 --> 01:55:10.946
OK, we are computing the error
when I go to that node instead

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20020-3
01:55:10.946 --> 01:55:14.343
of going for Ginny and a
entropy, they got a technical

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/19995-0
01:55:11.124 --> 01:55:11.324
So.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20020-4
01:55:14.343 --> 01:55:18.234
terms, but the classification
error you may refer as simply as

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20020-5
01:55:18.234 --> 01:55:18.604
error.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20034-0
01:55:19.024 --> 01:55:23.294
So, so, so out of these 301 by
6, one by three.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20063-0
01:55:23.484 --> 01:55:27.088
Sorry, we are the router, so
zero will be the zero will be

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20056-0
01:55:25.334 --> 01:55:27.354
Umm. Best, right?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20063-1
01:55:27.088 --> 01:55:27.454
there.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20065-0
01:55:27.464 --> 01:55:28.014
Yeah, you.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20070-0
01:55:27.704 --> 01:55:28.454
Best, right?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20082-0
01:55:28.024 --> 01:55:30.394
You always like to get that type
of node, yes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20077-0
01:55:28.464 --> 01:55:29.754
Yeah, yes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20080-0
01:55:30.184 --> 01:55:31.074
List list.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20083-0
01:55:31.084 --> 01:55:31.694
Yeah. OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20097-0
01:55:34.354 --> 01:55:38.674
So the splitting criteria is
going to be like this.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20121-0
01:55:38.684 --> 01:55:43.336
Suppose for a two class problem,
whenever you have a probability

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20121-1
01:55:43.336 --> 01:55:45.984
of one class is .1, the other is
.9.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20141-0
01:55:46.204 --> 01:55:50.990
So this will be the value and
when it is .5 point 5, this is

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20141-1
01:55:50.990 --> 01:55:51.774
the value.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20161-0
01:55:51.784 --> 01:55:56.286
So entropy will be one and
Jeannie and misclassification

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20161-1
01:55:56.286 --> 01:55:57.154
will be .5.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20175-0
01:55:57.724 --> 01:56:02.054
And when it is .8, this is the
type of values that you get.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20193-0
01:56:02.444 --> 01:56:08.355
So this is just to understand
that they are all helping you in

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20193-1
01:56:08.355 --> 01:56:09.574
improving it.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20209-0
01:56:09.584 --> 01:56:14.362
So they are constantly improving
up to .5 or so essentially

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20209-1
01:56:14.362 --> 01:56:15.874
whenever the class.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20249-0
01:56:16.264 --> 01:56:22.113
So when you have two classes .1
and 2.9 and the other one is .3

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20249-1
01:56:22.113 --> 01:56:27.871
and .7, all three of the majors
are saying that this is better

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20249-2
01:56:27.871 --> 01:56:29.424
than this better.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20254-0
01:56:33.914 --> 01:56:34.344
Right.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20263-0
01:56:34.354 --> 01:56:36.214
So that is that is what all of
them are saying.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20289-0
01:56:38.004 --> 01:56:44.454
And so now we look at, yes, yes,
yes, good.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20285-0
01:56:40.734 --> 01:56:44.674
The that one question there,
Sir, this is enabled.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20315-0
01:56:45.054 --> 01:56:48.714
So so now we have three, I would
say methodologies in order to

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20315-1
01:56:48.714 --> 01:56:51.734
come up with the best possible
combinations, right?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20309-0
01:56:49.314 --> 01:56:49.684
Thank you.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20322-0
01:56:51.744 --> 01:56:52.614
Or this splitting criteria.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20328-0
01:56:52.364 --> 01:56:53.604
Yes, yes, yes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20344-0
01:56:53.864 --> 01:56:57.205
Uh, and we saw the two class
problem, but how should we

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20340-0
01:56:56.644 --> 01:56:56.784
Yes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20344-1
01:56:57.205 --> 01:56:59.114
decide which approach is better?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20360-0
01:56:59.124 --> 01:57:00.404
Which algorithm is better here?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20355-0
01:57:00.754 --> 01:57:01.084
Yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20392-0
01:57:01.434 --> 01:57:05.482
I see nobody has really because
most of the people, the experts

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20392-1
01:57:05.482 --> 01:57:09.530
say that they give more or less
at least entropy and Gini index

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20392-2
01:57:09.530 --> 01:57:10.984
work more or less well.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20441-0
01:57:11.694 --> 01:57:17.342
Classification error is not used
in many times and the algorithms

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20441-1
01:57:17.342 --> 01:57:22.477
that you use, they may have some
default saying that either

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20441-2
01:57:22.477 --> 01:57:27.697
entropy or Gini index, but they
permit you to choose the the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20441-3
01:57:27.697 --> 01:57:32.574
heuristic that you want to use
for for doing this split.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20459-0
01:57:33.054 --> 01:57:36.679
So they allow you to specify
which is the split criteria that

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20449-0
01:57:33.524 --> 01:57:33.784
OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20459-1
01:57:36.679 --> 01:57:37.614
you want to use.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20472-0
01:57:37.804 --> 01:57:41.997
So really all of them give more
or less similar quality decision

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20472-1
01:57:41.997 --> 01:57:42.384
trees.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20473-0
01:57:44.004 --> 01:57:44.224
OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20477-0
01:57:46.334 --> 01:57:46.964
Alright, Sir.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20484-0
01:57:47.074 --> 01:57:47.434
Thank you.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20496-0
01:57:47.434 --> 01:57:53.433
Then we will go for one more
concept and this concept is

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20496-1
01:57:53.433 --> 01:57:56.064
expanding beyond entropy.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20511-0
01:57:56.334 --> 01:58:00.656
OK, so this is this is
essentially going beyond entropy

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20511-1
01:58:00.656 --> 01:58:01.504
gain ratio.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20521-0
01:58:07.894 --> 01:58:09.484
So it works like this.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20531-0
01:58:09.494 --> 01:58:12.444
Suppose that we have got a a.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20559-0
01:58:12.494 --> 01:58:16.860
The entropy that we are
calculating, we have the formula

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20559-1
01:58:16.860 --> 01:58:21.685
and then we we are looking at
the gain and then we are looking

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20559-2
01:58:21.685 --> 01:58:22.604
at the game.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20567-0
01:58:22.674 --> 01:58:24.984
So now what happens is that.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20590-0
01:58:25.324 --> 01:58:30.247
Suppose let me go back to the
some a screen that I have shown

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20590-1
01:58:30.247 --> 01:58:33.264
you long ago, some half an hour
back.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20593-0
01:58:33.274 --> 01:58:33.474
Right.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20598-0
01:58:34.684 --> 01:58:37.834
Suppose that you look at this.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20627-0
01:58:38.104 --> 01:58:43.449
I wanted you to think about this
right, so now you can see that

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20627-1
01:58:43.449 --> 01:58:48.794
when you consider only entropy,
this will have after the split.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20633-0
01:58:48.804 --> 01:58:49.484
This will have.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20639-0
01:58:51.114 --> 01:58:53.804
This will have entropy which is
0.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20647-0
01:58:54.374 --> 01:58:56.554
This has an entropy which is
small.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20658-0
01:58:57.794 --> 01:59:01.684
This will have entropy, which is
large after split right?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20683-0
01:59:01.814 --> 01:59:05.285
So it is so easy between first
one and second one to say that

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20683-1
01:59:05.285 --> 01:59:08.084
entropy of small is better than
entropy of large.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20704-0
01:59:08.654 --> 01:59:12.064
But then what you will do with
this attribute which is giving

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20704-1
01:59:12.064 --> 01:59:13.164
you an entropy of 0.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20718-0
01:59:13.954 --> 01:59:18.384
So this is able to do this by
doing a large number of splits.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20731-0
01:59:18.794 --> 01:59:21.564
So for example, there is an
attribute which is.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20751-0
01:59:21.634 --> 01:59:25.946
You have a data set of services
1000 and there is one attribute

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20751-1
01:59:25.946 --> 01:59:27.764
which is taking 500 values.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20775-0
01:59:28.054 --> 01:59:32.340
So using that attribute you may
get very small entropy, or you

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20775-1
01:59:32.340 --> 01:59:33.904
may get very high gain.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20799-0
01:59:34.254 --> 01:59:39.983
So to prevent that attribute
dominating, we use a new major

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20799-1
01:59:39.983 --> 01:59:45.521
which is derived from entropy,
which is called as a green

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20799-2
01:59:45.521 --> 01:59:46.094
ratio.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20821-0
01:59:46.444 --> 01:59:50.883
So what we do is that suppose
that we have a data set and we

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20821-1
01:59:50.883 --> 01:59:52.774
are computing the entropy.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20831-0
01:59:53.304 --> 01:59:55.574
We are computing the entropy of
all the paths.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20842-0
01:59:56.734 --> 02:00:01.684
Then we are also considering, so
this is the entropy calculation.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20868-0
02:00:01.914 --> 02:00:06.844
So we have 3 attributes, income
and then whether student or not.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20936-0
02:00:06.854 --> 02:00:11.637
What is a credit rating and then
based on that, we can get the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20936-1
02:00:11.637 --> 02:00:16.420
what is the gain that you are
getting then what you do is that

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20936-2
02:00:16.420 --> 02:00:20.975
because income and possibly
there are more values for these

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20936-3
02:00:20.975 --> 02:00:25.834
two for the student, there are
only binary split but for credit

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20936-4
02:00:25.834 --> 02:00:30.389
rating the split these fade and
excellent it is also binary

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20936-5
02:00:30.389 --> 02:00:34.564
split but with the income it is
a split along 3 paths.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20955-0
02:00:35.074 --> 02:00:39.944
So what we do is that the income
is giving a small gain.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20968-0
02:00:40.634 --> 02:00:43.684
Income is giving the this much
gain and the student.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/20974-0
02:00:43.694 --> 02:00:45.054
So in this case, yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21012-0
02:00:45.744 --> 02:00:50.978
But then what we want to do is
that we want to normalize this

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21012-1
02:00:50.978 --> 02:00:55.874
by this split information, which
is saying that if we are

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21012-2
02:00:55.874 --> 02:01:00.854
dividing it into multiple paths,
we consider this formula.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21022-0
02:01:01.074 --> 02:01:03.704
Suppose that we have 16 paths.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21032-0
02:01:04.354 --> 02:01:08.754
So what we do is that 16 paths
dividing.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21036-0
02:01:12.424 --> 02:01:13.784
The data equally.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21072-0
02:01:17.554 --> 02:01:26.583
So the split information will be
minus Sigma of 1 to 16, then 1

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21072-1
02:01:26.583 --> 02:01:31.944
by 16 multiplied by log 2 of 1
by 16.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21085-0
02:01:32.534 --> 02:01:36.124
So that will come as that will
come match.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21114-0
02:01:36.874 --> 02:01:43.958
So so this will be equal to 16 *
1 by 16 * 4 because this minus

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21114-1
02:01:43.958 --> 02:01:49.824
four because of the minus in the
formula it becomes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21130-0
02:01:50.014 --> 02:01:54.144
So now what we are saying is
that split information is 4.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21173-0
02:01:54.334 --> 02:01:59.112
So we are saying that when we
are dividing it by 16 paths, we

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21173-1
02:01:59.112 --> 02:02:03.581
divide the gain gain by the
split information and then we

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21173-2
02:02:03.581 --> 02:02:08.358
use the gain ratio to decide
which is giving us the best gain

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21173-3
02:02:08.358 --> 02:02:10.284
among all the attributes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21189-0
02:02:10.654 --> 02:02:13.764
So if you take the example, you
can try with this example.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21199-0
02:02:14.464 --> 02:02:17.634
You can try with the example at
home.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21206-0
02:02:17.684 --> 02:02:20.614
I'm giving this as a task.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21241-0
02:02:20.664 --> 02:02:25.616
Just try and convince yourself
that gain ratio will eliminate

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21241-1
02:02:25.616 --> 02:02:30.407
the third path, even though
third part is giving an entropy

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21241-2
02:02:30.407 --> 02:02:32.084
of 0 or maximum gain.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21270-0
02:02:32.404 --> 02:02:36.705
So if you use the gain ratio,
that will say that the second

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21270-1
02:02:36.705 --> 02:02:40.504
attribute is better than the 3rd
and 1st attributes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21287-0
02:02:40.954 --> 02:02:46.121
So you can validate that
yourself and I'm stopping with

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21287-1
02:02:46.121 --> 02:02:47.504
the gain ratio.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21293-0
02:02:47.514 --> 02:02:48.914
So is I hope it is understood.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21306-0
02:02:51.854 --> 02:02:55.124
You apply that formula and then
try with the.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21310-0
02:02:55.254 --> 02:02:55.664
Yes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21315-0
02:02:55.674 --> 02:02:57.584
OK, Mr Rajesh, it's clear.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21341-0
02:02:57.714 --> 02:03:01.749
So so you try that with the same
data set with the three

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21341-1
02:03:01.749 --> 02:03:05.784
attributes for each of them, you
compute the gain ratio.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21428-0
02:03:05.914 --> 02:03:09.800
So in this case the student ID
be eliminated because we said

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21428-1
02:03:09.800 --> 02:03:13.686
student ID cannot be useful
because it will never provide as

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21428-2
02:03:13.686 --> 02:03:17.572
a discriminative information or
even when there are too many

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21428-3
02:03:17.572 --> 02:03:21.139
paths, we can easily notice
that, but the gain ratio is

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21428-4
02:03:21.139 --> 02:03:24.898
giving us a sophisticated metric
whereby we can see we can

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21428-5
02:03:24.898 --> 02:03:28.656
automatically consider the split
paths and the gain in the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21428-6
02:03:28.656 --> 02:03:32.733
entropy and then combine them to
see identify which is the best

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21428-7
02:03:32.733 --> 02:03:34.134
attribute to consider.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21434-0
02:03:34.504 --> 02:03:36.174
So are there any questions?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21450-0
02:03:36.184 --> 02:03:40.394
So we I'm we are overrunning so.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21454-0
02:03:40.334 --> 02:03:40.594
Yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21468-0
02:03:40.564 --> 02:03:46.201
So what we can do is this is so
refining the decision tree

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21468-1
02:03:46.201 --> 02:03:46.774
model.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21497-0
02:03:46.904 --> 02:03:52.044
So there are there is a little
few more concepts on how what we

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21497-1
02:03:52.044 --> 02:03:56.943
can do to refine it further that
uh, we can take in the next

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21497-2
02:03:56.943 --> 02:03:57.424
class.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21522-0
02:03:57.434 --> 02:04:01.385
So I'll take now at this point,
if there are any questions on

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21522-1
02:04:01.385 --> 02:04:04.634
what we discussed till now, I'm
willing to answer.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21525-0
02:04:05.464 --> 02:04:07.064
Umm yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21530-0
02:04:07.124 --> 02:04:07.714
Yes, Sir.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21547-0
02:04:07.924 --> 02:04:09.934
Can you go on page #28?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21540-0
02:04:08.334 --> 02:04:08.574
So.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21557-0
02:04:10.874 --> 02:04:12.134
Oh, oh, you.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21561-0
02:04:11.234 --> 02:04:13.534
Go to the slide #2028, right.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21568-0
02:04:13.304 --> 02:04:14.064
Yes, yes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21570-0
02:04:14.344 --> 02:04:15.904
Yes, it just give me one minute.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21578-0
02:04:18.964 --> 02:04:20.274
Yes, this one, right.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21590-0
02:04:21.364 --> 02:04:23.754
Umm, no, after this that is.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21591-0
02:04:23.554 --> 02:04:25.194
OK, this one, this one. Right.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21607-0
02:04:25.204 --> 02:04:27.394
OK, OK. Yes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21599-0
02:04:25.794 --> 02:04:26.744
Yes, yes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21644-0
02:04:27.054 --> 02:04:31.618
Here's her uh, when we choose
that car type, why you are

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21621-0
02:04:31.114 --> 02:04:31.294
Yes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21644-1
02:04:31.618 --> 02:04:36.662
telling that that two the 1st
and the 3rd node you are telling

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21644-2
02:04:36.662 --> 02:04:40.264
as a nearly pure and the center
one is pure.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21651-0
02:04:40.424 --> 02:04:41.104
Why it is so?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21666-0
02:04:41.994 --> 02:04:45.619
OK, first node, you can see that
both the classes are present,

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21666-1
02:04:45.619 --> 02:04:45.964
right?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21676-0
02:04:45.974 --> 02:04:47.724
There are four tuples out of
them.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21691-0
02:04:47.734 --> 02:04:50.424
One tuple is of class zero and
three tuples are class one.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21709-0
02:04:51.424 --> 02:04:54.514
Second one is pure because there
is a nothing of class one.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21722-0
02:04:54.524 --> 02:04:57.494
Everything is of Class 0, so we
call it pure.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21736-0
02:04:57.504 --> 02:05:00.794
If you compute the entropy for
this node, it will come at 0.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21753-0
02:05:00.804 --> 02:05:05.142
Even the Gini index will come at
zero for the third, third tuple,

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21753-1
02:05:05.142 --> 02:05:05.864
third node.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21770-0
02:05:05.874 --> 02:05:10.294
We are seeing that these C0 is
only one C one is 7.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21787-0
02:05:10.304 --> 02:05:13.713
So if you compute the entropy or
Gini, it will come as very

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21787-1
02:05:13.713 --> 02:05:14.054
small.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21795-0
02:05:14.404 --> 02:05:15.524
Is that clear misery?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21796-0
02:05:16.604 --> 02:05:16.994
Yes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21832-0
02:05:17.084 --> 02:05:22.478
So here it means that in node
that it in a particular node we

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21832-1
02:05:22.478 --> 02:05:28.132
uh whatever data we have, we are
dividing into those two classes

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21832-2
02:05:28.132 --> 02:05:28.654
right?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21850-0
02:05:28.784 --> 02:05:30.484
It is it like that or something?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21857-0
02:05:29.514 --> 02:05:32.984
This is the two class problem,
Miss Ruby just just to go.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21867-0
02:05:31.944 --> 02:05:32.394
Two classes?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21870-0
02:05:32.994 --> 02:05:34.444
We are going with the two class
problem.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21873-0
02:05:34.454 --> 02:05:35.084
Yeah, go ahead.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21878-0
02:05:35.054 --> 02:05:35.524
OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21885-0
02:05:35.094 --> 02:05:35.584
Go ahead. Yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21883-0
02:05:35.644 --> 02:05:36.964
OK, OK, got it.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21888-0
02:05:36.974 --> 02:05:37.764
Got it, Sir.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21948-0
02:05:38.094 --> 02:05:42.397
So in each node there is two
class and in that class that

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21948-1
02:05:42.397 --> 02:05:46.848
whatever tuples are there on
basis of that we are comparing

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21948-2
02:05:46.848 --> 02:05:50.854
the node values that which one
node priority yeah OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21925-0
02:05:47.084 --> 02:05:47.814
The purity.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21928-0
02:05:47.824 --> 02:05:48.554
No. Purity.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21937-0
02:05:48.644 --> 02:05:49.274
Yeah, right.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21943-0
02:05:49.284 --> 02:05:50.634
No, right.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21961-0
02:05:50.684 --> 02:05:54.795
And then for the and then we
have a mechanism to combine all

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21961-1
02:05:54.795 --> 02:05:55.334
of them.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21999-0
02:05:55.404 --> 02:05:59.244
We have seen the mechanism when
we split across multiple paths,

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21999-1
02:05:59.244 --> 02:06:03.144
we take the weight is we give a
weightage of this one we get say

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/21999-2
02:06:03.144 --> 02:06:04.224
weightage of four.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22008-0
02:06:04.234 --> 02:06:06.564
This one gets a weightage of
eight and so.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22030-0
02:06:06.634 --> 02:06:13.186
So suppose that we are using
entropy, so this is this is, let

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22030-1
02:06:13.186 --> 02:06:15.194
us say even and E2.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22077-0
02:06:15.254 --> 02:06:23.385
These are the three entropies so
we say that the four by 16 of E

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22077-1
02:06:23.385 --> 02:06:30.764
4 by 20 right 20 of E 1 + 8 by
20 of E 2 + 8 by 20 of E 3.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22096-0
02:06:30.894 --> 02:06:34.693
So we say that when you split
using the attribute to our car

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22096-1
02:06:34.693 --> 02:06:35.004
type.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22108-0
02:06:35.504 --> 02:06:38.744
So this is the entropy new
entropy that you will have.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22115-0
02:06:40.954 --> 02:06:41.774
OK, OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22139-0
02:06:41.784 --> 02:06:45.252
Sir answer another question is
later with Guinea index, but I

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22139-1
02:06:45.252 --> 02:06:47.154
think people are waiting for
you.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22155-0
02:06:47.224 --> 02:06:50.824
So first please, I will ask at
last.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22151-0
02:06:47.794 --> 02:06:50.114
OK, so people want to ask more
questions. OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22156-0
02:06:51.364 --> 02:06:52.014
Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22168-0
02:06:54.284 --> 02:06:55.584
So other people have some
question.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22164-0
02:06:54.354 --> 02:06:54.554
So.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22172-0
02:06:56.674 --> 02:06:57.824
Yeah, I have a question.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22188-0
02:06:57.834 --> 02:07:01.118
So when when we are doing a
discretization for the numeric

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22188-1
02:07:01.118 --> 02:07:02.064
attribute, right?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22212-0
02:07:02.074 --> 02:07:05.889
So the number of the Genie index
doesn't give us any information

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22212-1
02:07:05.889 --> 02:07:08.881
regarding the number of
categories we are going to

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22212-2
02:07:08.881 --> 02:07:09.644
split, right?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22264-0
02:07:09.654 --> 02:07:15.790
So in the example we did A2 way
split uh, and then we found the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22244-0
02:07:13.984 --> 02:07:15.854
That is right, great.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22264-1
02:07:15.790 --> 02:07:21.734
genie index for all the possible
like splits that you can do.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22260-0
02:07:20.704 --> 02:07:21.954
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22270-0
02:07:22.024 --> 02:07:24.254
The example is only two way
split.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22302-0
02:07:24.324 --> 02:07:27.801
But suppose that you want to do
a 3 way split to saying that the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22302-1
02:07:27.801 --> 02:07:31.224
income you want to categorize as
low, middle, high, or some way

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22302-2
02:07:31.224 --> 02:07:32.614
some number of categories.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22352-0
02:07:32.804 --> 02:07:36.984
So you need to do go by trial
and error because the point is

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22352-1
02:07:36.984 --> 02:07:41.095
that we have seen that the
numerical data we have seen that

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22352-2
02:07:41.095 --> 02:07:45.001
there are many ways in which you
do the normalization or

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22352-3
02:07:45.001 --> 02:07:47.604
essentially we learned about
binning.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22368-0
02:07:47.904 --> 02:07:52.392
So the binning is we can take
multiple approaches for binning

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22368-1
02:07:52.392 --> 02:07:52.754
hand.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22375-0
02:07:52.764 --> 02:07:56.054
Each bin may represent something
so.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22388-0
02:07:56.064 --> 02:07:58.854
So the point is, there is really
nothing that you can do.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22425-0
02:07:58.864 --> 02:08:03.027
You have to do a various types
of trial and error in order to

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22425-1
02:08:03.027 --> 02:08:07.189
see what is it that you get, but
typically like we are seeing

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22425-2
02:08:07.189 --> 02:08:09.874
that the income is middle high
and low.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22438-0
02:08:10.124 --> 02:08:13.254
Similarly, you can have for even
our other products.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22445-0
02:08:13.264 --> 02:08:14.594
For example, you have gadgets.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22452-0
02:08:15.074 --> 02:08:16.474
Let's say it is a mobile phone.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22483-0
02:08:16.484 --> 02:08:18.989
You know that people have
already divided the mobile

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22483-1
02:08:18.989 --> 02:08:21.776
phones based on some criteria,
saying that one is high and

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22483-2
02:08:21.776 --> 02:08:23.524
mobile phone are there is
something.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22488-0
02:08:23.344 --> 02:08:23.654
Then.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22510-0
02:08:23.534 --> 02:08:27.885
So the point is price is again
the divided, so the numbers they

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22510-1
02:08:27.885 --> 02:08:31.284
get divided there is a based on
domain knowledge.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22517-0
02:08:31.294 --> 02:08:32.724
But there is a reset only.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22530-0
02:08:32.734 --> 02:08:36.914
No, no foundation or found
theory to do that.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22531-0
02:08:37.994 --> 02:08:38.664
OK. OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22533-0
02:08:38.674 --> 02:08:39.034
Thank you.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22545-0
02:08:41.254 --> 02:08:42.964
So will this lecture be in?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22557-0
02:08:43.174 --> 02:08:45.674
Will this like lecture be in in
a in the quiz?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22576-0
02:08:47.914 --> 02:08:50.686
So my question is that is there
anything in this lecture that

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22576-1
02:08:50.686 --> 02:08:51.714
you did not understand?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22583-0
02:08:54.374 --> 02:08:55.124
No, I understood.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22591-0
02:08:56.094 --> 02:08:57.544
OK, then why are you?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22602-0
02:08:57.254 --> 02:08:57.704
So.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22612-0
02:08:57.554 --> 02:08:59.054
You are already ready for the
quiz, yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22605-0
02:08:57.714 --> 02:08:57.854
So.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22631-0
02:08:59.434 --> 02:09:00.994
Sir, how many questions will be
there?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22624-0
02:08:59.764 --> 02:09:02.104
So, Sir, what type of questions
we can expect?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22645-0
02:09:02.144 --> 02:09:03.324
I mean out of these lectures.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22655-0
02:09:02.314 --> 02:09:06.304
All the antiques all are M sick
is all our MCQ and my.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22669-0
02:09:05.684 --> 02:09:08.907
He understood things, but like
we need practice and for that at

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22669-1
02:09:08.907 --> 02:09:10.014
least we need one day.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22692-0
02:09:10.024 --> 02:09:12.874
Right, like so many medicals and
concepts.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22675-0
02:09:10.954 --> 02:09:11.544
No, no, no.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22682-0
02:09:11.554 --> 02:09:11.924
Do you?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22688-0
02:09:11.974 --> 02:09:12.684
Don't don't worry.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22697-0
02:09:12.694 --> 02:09:15.824
I mean, don't don't go with that
type.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22714-0
02:09:15.834 --> 02:09:18.798
See the when we set the
questions, they will be

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22714-1
02:09:18.798 --> 02:09:21.144
challenging but somewhat
challenging.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22736-0
02:09:21.154 --> 02:09:24.597
Not not saying that it's
something you cannot do, but

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22736-1
02:09:24.597 --> 02:09:27.784
then something that we know that
we we have seen.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22758-0
02:09:27.794 --> 02:09:32.823
In fact, we we have experience
with several colleagues of yours

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22758-1
02:09:32.823 --> 02:09:35.494
with you were kind of
background.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22766-0
02:09:35.504 --> 02:09:36.884
So you don't have to worry
about.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22772-0
02:09:38.214 --> 02:09:39.854
The how many questions are how
much time?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22782-0
02:09:41.474 --> 02:09:42.624
Those are already set.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22794-0
02:09:42.634 --> 02:09:45.584
I think 20 questions will be
there and you get one hour to

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22794-1
02:09:45.584 --> 02:09:46.034
complete.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22802-0
02:09:48.004 --> 02:09:49.394
Five points are there right?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22816-0
02:09:49.824 --> 02:09:51.484
20 question 5.1 hour.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22817-0
02:09:50.824 --> 02:09:52.804
Yes, yes, yes, yes, that is
correct, yes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22829-0
02:09:54.874 --> 02:09:57.134
So all our multiple choice
questions so.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22830-0
02:09:57.594 --> 02:09:58.214
Yes, right.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22849-0
02:10:01.364 --> 02:10:03.774
Sir, can you explain once that
Guinea index?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22846-0
02:10:04.604 --> 02:10:04.904
Yes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22862-0
02:10:04.914 --> 02:10:07.064
Yes, Jenny index, what is the
question you have Miss Ruby?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22865-0
02:10:08.224 --> 02:10:09.254
Uh said, actually.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22905-0
02:10:09.264 --> 02:10:13.404
I was just stuck with pure and
impure and I was not that much

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22905-1
02:10:13.404 --> 02:10:17.410
focused on Guinea index that I
was trying to understand the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22905-2
02:10:17.410 --> 02:10:20.414
classification that how that
node it is now.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22912-0
02:10:20.424 --> 02:10:23.104
It is clear that how it is.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22914-0
02:10:23.114 --> 02:10:23.524
Yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22930-0
02:10:23.624 --> 02:10:27.084
So that's why I just want to
understand this once again, Sir.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22938-0
02:10:28.284 --> 02:10:30.634
None of the formula of Gini
index right?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22951-0
02:10:30.644 --> 02:10:31.774
What is that you want to you?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22947-0
02:10:31.084 --> 02:10:31.314
Yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22953-0
02:10:32.704 --> 02:10:33.284
Yes, Sir.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22996-0
02:10:33.334 --> 02:10:40.351
I have formula and how we are
putting the value here that I am

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23002-0
02:10:40.324 --> 02:10:44.284
OK, so so you want you want to
know how we got .278?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/22996-1
02:10:40.351 --> 02:10:42.244
not working with.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23016-0
02:10:44.934 --> 02:10:47.554
Yes, yes, yes, everything's for
this one.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23017-0
02:10:47.484 --> 02:10:48.734
OK, you want to know this.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23034-0
02:10:48.824 --> 02:10:52.274
So The thing is that you you you
understand this is 1 node right?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23029-0
02:10:49.444 --> 02:10:49.684
Yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23048-0
02:10:52.714 --> 02:10:55.194
So what is the probability of
class one?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23044-0
02:10:52.854 --> 02:10:53.454
Yes, yes.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23056-0
02:10:55.744 --> 02:10:57.344
This is equal to 1 by 6 right?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23070-0
02:10:58.604 --> 02:11:01.774
But I probability of Class 2 is
5 by 6.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23063-0
02:10:58.764 --> 02:10:58.954
Uh.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23072-0
02:11:01.784 --> 02:11:02.254
Is that correct?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23095-0
02:11:04.154 --> 02:11:09.834
My 6 and 25 by 6 probability of
Class 2 uh.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23121-0
02:11:10.154 --> 02:11:13.104
OK, for you are talking about
only the second one.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23128-0
02:11:13.214 --> 02:11:15.784
The second node, yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23135-0
02:11:13.964 --> 02:11:16.494
Now you're same thing applies to
any known. Now it's.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23130-0
02:11:15.794 --> 02:11:16.254
Yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23132-0
02:11:16.424 --> 02:11:16.654
OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23137-0
02:11:16.574 --> 02:11:17.134
Yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23142-0
02:11:16.664 --> 02:11:17.434
OK. OK, OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23158-0
02:11:17.204 --> 02:11:19.534
So you can use the same formula
for everything.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23145-0
02:11:17.504 --> 02:11:17.774
OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23153-0
02:11:17.784 --> 02:11:17.994
OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23155-0
02:11:18.004 --> 02:11:18.134
OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23161-0
02:11:19.544 --> 02:11:19.764
Yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23165-0
02:11:19.544 --> 02:11:20.224
Ha ha ha.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23213-0
02:11:19.774 --> 02:11:23.530
OK, so so all we are doing is we
are using this computation to

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23167-0
02:11:20.264 --> 02:11:20.514
OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23180-0
02:11:20.524 --> 02:11:20.974
OK, OK. Yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23213-1
02:11:23.530 --> 02:11:26.988
compute the G so we got the
probability for these two and

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23213-2
02:11:26.988 --> 02:11:30.564
then we are subtracting the
square of that and then we get.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23237-0
02:11:31.894 --> 02:11:35.155
So is there any specific range
for Genie impurity that it

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23237-1
02:11:35.155 --> 02:11:36.054
should be range?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23261-0
02:11:35.534 --> 02:11:40.110
The maximum for a two class
problem can be .5, but for

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23248-0
02:11:39.944 --> 02:11:40.224
OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23261-1
02:11:40.110 --> 02:11:45.185
higher class problem it can go
it minus of 1 by three one by

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23261-2
02:11:45.185 --> 02:11:45.684
three.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23275-0
02:11:46.574 --> 02:11:49.304
So it can be higher for higher
class problems.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23327-0
02:11:49.314 --> 02:11:52.454
It can be higher, but for two
class problems, it's the maximum

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23327-1
02:11:52.454 --> 02:11:55.245
can be .5 for higher class
problem it can go higher but

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23327-2
02:11:55.245 --> 02:11:58.285
never below beyond one because
this is you know you from the

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23327-3
02:11:58.285 --> 02:12:01.225
right from the formula you can
say you can never go beyond

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23327-4
02:12:01.225 --> 02:12:01.474
that.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23328-0
02:12:01.344 --> 02:12:01.564
Yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23356-0
02:12:03.994 --> 02:12:06.524
It'll be ranging from zero to
0.5, but basically.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23367-0
02:12:06.684 --> 02:12:09.285
You with the two class problem,
but for three class problem it

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23367-1
02:12:09.285 --> 02:12:10.234
can go a little higher.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23377-0
02:12:10.304 --> 02:12:11.404
The range can be a little
higher.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23380-0
02:12:12.064 --> 02:12:12.914
For entropy, Sir.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23384-0
02:12:14.274 --> 02:12:14.944
Entropy.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23415-0
02:12:14.954 --> 02:12:21.387
It is the same thing now it is a
0 to one and the for higher

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23415-1
02:12:21.387 --> 02:12:26.764
class problem it can be from the
entropy range is.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23428-0
02:12:26.834 --> 02:12:31.794
Let me go to the entropy slide
so that I don't confuse entropy.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23430-0
02:12:31.804 --> 02:12:32.044
Yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23466-0
02:12:32.054 --> 02:12:40.037
OK, so the range will be from
zero to OK 02 log 2 NC when

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23466-1
02:12:40.037 --> 02:12:45.404
number of classes is 2 it is 0
to one.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23478-0
02:12:45.614 --> 02:12:48.674
When it is 4, it is from zero to
two.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23491-0
02:12:49.574 --> 02:12:52.164
When it is 8, it is zero through
three.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23537-0
02:12:52.414 --> 02:12:56.595
When with the 8 classes and when
it is something in between,

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23537-1
02:12:56.595 --> 02:13:00.913
suppose that if it is 3 classes
so you are going to get log of

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23537-2
02:13:00.913 --> 02:13:04.752
base two, it is going to be
about 1.7 or something like

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23537-3
02:13:04.752 --> 02:13:05.094
that.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23541-0
02:13:06.864 --> 02:13:07.774
OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23552-0
02:13:07.824 --> 02:13:08.184
Thank you.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23553-0
02:13:07.904 --> 02:13:09.294
So this is this is the thing.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23559-0
02:13:09.364 --> 02:13:11.114
You can compute it using the
calculator.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23565-0
02:13:11.124 --> 02:13:11.964
What will be the range?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23566-0
02:13:11.764 --> 02:13:11.944
Yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23575-0
02:13:15.834 --> 02:13:18.754
OK so please upload this
annotated.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23579-0
02:13:20.534 --> 02:13:20.944
PPT.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23587-0
02:13:22.634 --> 02:13:24.074
Ohh this is going to be heavy.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23590-0
02:13:24.084 --> 02:13:24.754
OK, fine.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23597-0
02:13:24.814 --> 02:13:26.664
So The thing is.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23603-0
02:13:25.414 --> 02:13:25.704
Yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23599-0
02:13:26.674 --> 02:13:26.954
Yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23615-0
02:13:27.004 --> 02:13:28.044
OK, I'll I'll do this.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23610-0
02:13:27.894 --> 02:13:28.304
Thank you.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23619-0
02:13:28.304 --> 02:13:29.474
A.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23612-0
02:13:28.794 --> 02:13:29.264
Bye.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23622-0
02:13:29.474 --> 02:13:30.014
Thank you, Sir.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23624-0
02:13:30.144 --> 02:13:31.454
What you see here?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23661-0
02:13:31.504 --> 02:13:35.100
See just I want to understand
like log it is category like if

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23661-1
02:13:35.100 --> 02:13:38.870
we are divided into 2 then basis
two if we divide into the three

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23661-2
02:13:38.870 --> 02:13:40.204
then it's become three.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23666-0
02:13:41.364 --> 02:13:43.254
That that class actually.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23681-0
02:13:43.264 --> 02:13:45.064
Yeah, you're seeing it correct
class.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23683-0
02:13:44.834 --> 02:13:45.694
OK, OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23690-0
02:13:45.314 --> 02:13:48.864
The value of the entropy maximum
possible value of entropy.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23706-0
02:13:48.874 --> 02:13:51.130
That is what we are seeing is
that the question or something

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23706-1
02:13:51.130 --> 02:13:51.314
else?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23732-0
02:13:53.564 --> 02:13:57.094
So in this slide, I'm trying to
ask see value of C.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23724-0
02:13:57.094 --> 02:13:57.344
No.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23727-0
02:13:57.454 --> 02:13:57.924
OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23740-0
02:13:57.934 --> 02:13:59.394
Which slide the current slide,
right?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23749-0
02:13:58.794 --> 02:14:00.874
The currents like, yeah, yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23751-0
02:13:59.404 --> 02:14:00.154
This slide only, right?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23760-0
02:14:00.814 --> 02:14:01.154
Yeah, yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23764-0
02:14:00.884 --> 02:14:02.414
C is the category, he explained.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23774-0
02:14:02.424 --> 02:14:03.994
My colleagues explained me.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23767-0
02:14:03.474 --> 02:14:03.824
No, no.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23782-0
02:14:03.834 --> 02:14:05.644
C is indicating the number of
classes.

02:14:05.654 --> 02:14:10.251
NYC is indicating the number of
classes, so it is a two class

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23788-0
02:14:06.154 --> 02:14:06.504
Exactly.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23798-0
02:14:08.344 --> 02:14:08.554
Who?

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23805-1
02:14:10.251 --> 02:14:10.844
problem.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23826-0
02:14:10.854 --> 02:14:15.091
Log to the base two is of two is
1, so it is zero to 1 entropy

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23826-1
02:14:15.091 --> 02:14:15.494
range.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23850-0
02:14:16.284 --> 02:14:19.783
But when you have 8 classes and
then you have to build a

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23850-1
02:14:19.783 --> 02:14:23.404
classifier so the entropy range
can be from zero to three.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23853-0
02:14:25.424 --> 02:14:25.824
OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23858-0
02:14:28.184 --> 02:14:29.914
OK, OK, Sir.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23865-0

Yeah.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23874-0
02:14:31.684 --> 02:14:36.204
OK, so to see the annotated OK.

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23897-0
02:14:47.644 --> 02:14:50.502
So if there are no more
questions, then we can close

1da23718-0b24-44e7-bf85-b4e593b161d2/23897-1
02:14:50.502 --> 02:14:51.634
this session alright.
