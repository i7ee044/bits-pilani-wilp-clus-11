27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/58-0
00:00:13.461 --> 00:00:14.001
Good evening.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/74-0
00:00:16.551 --> 00:00:21.462
Are there any questions from
anything that we discussed in

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/74-1
00:00:21.462 --> 00:00:22.211
the past?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/92-0
00:00:32.961 --> 00:00:36.561
He just key enable the MIC for
everyone.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/103-0
00:00:58.051 --> 00:00:58.461
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/113-0
00:00:58.471 --> 00:01:02.731
Then we will continue from where
we left in the last class.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/118-0
00:01:04.641 --> 00:01:05.141
I hope.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/126-0
00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:06.791
No, E no.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/164-0
00:01:07.051 --> 00:01:12.656
The concept of decision tree is
pretty clear and to construct a

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/164-1
00:01:12.656 --> 00:01:18.437
decision tree we use heuristics,
and that heuristic can be either

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/164-2
00:01:18.437 --> 00:01:22.991
a Gini index or entropy party
classification error.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/198-0
00:01:24.021 --> 00:01:30.746
So in either case, our intention
is to is to find pure end nodes

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/198-1
00:01:30.746 --> 00:01:36.851
by dividing the training data
based on various attributes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/202-0
00:01:36.861 --> 00:01:38.751
We keep trying with various
attributes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/218-0
00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:50.001
OK, Mr Rajesh, there were a
couple of questions on canvas.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/224-0
00:01:50.011 --> 00:01:51.311
Based on the quiz prediction.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/227-0
00:01:52.291 --> 00:01:52.751
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/231-0
00:01:52.941 --> 00:01:54.031
Yes, Mr Rajesh.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/236-0
00:01:54.041 --> 00:01:54.981
Yeah, we can talk.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/240-0
00:01:55.391 --> 00:01:56.001
We can talk.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/247-0
00:01:56.011 --> 00:01:56.841
I had asked.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/262-0
00:01:57.611 --> 00:02:01.411
See, The thing is that I wanted
there was one.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/284-0
00:02:01.601 --> 00:02:08.399
Ohh participant Mr Kapil Garg,
who has raised the question and

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/284-1
00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.341
he is not present.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/297-0
00:02:10.411 --> 00:02:13.071
But if it is a question for
everyone, yeah, sure, I can

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/297-1
00:02:13.071 --> 00:02:13.641
answer that.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/300-0
00:02:14.521 --> 00:02:15.801
OK, so let's.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/311-0
00:02:17.481 --> 00:02:20.731
Uh, can somebody tell me what is
the?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/321-0
00:02:20.781 --> 00:02:23.961
What is the thing that is really
requires clarification?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/326-0
00:02:34.531 --> 00:02:35.261
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/328-0
00:02:35.271 --> 00:02:35.641
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/334-0
00:02:35.651 --> 00:02:38.191
OK, Mr Rajesh, I'm sure.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/337-0
00:02:38.231 --> 00:02:38.781
See.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/351-0
00:02:39.131 --> 00:02:43.532
See first thing is that there
are conventions which we need to

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/351-1
00:02:43.532 --> 00:02:44.021
follow.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/388-0
00:02:44.551 --> 00:02:49.405
So the point is that the what
association discovers is based

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/388-1
00:02:49.405 --> 00:02:53.942
on the data that is present, so
it is going to create an

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/388-2
00:02:53.942 --> 00:02:57.921
association rule based on the
data it is studied.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/392-0
00:02:57.931 --> 00:02:58.521
So.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/411-0
00:02:58.651 --> 00:03:02.616
So the point is that is it going
to be used for some predictive

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/411-1
00:03:02.616 --> 00:03:04.041
purposes in the future?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/417-0
00:03:04.941 --> 00:03:05.871
It is possible.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/433-0
00:03:05.881 --> 00:03:10.017
It is possible it can be used,
but then association itself is

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/433-1
00:03:10.017 --> 00:03:10.351
ends.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/460-0
00:03:10.361 --> 00:03:14.329
The task ends with the finding
the rules, so all we are saying

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/460-1
00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:18.046
is that it is descriptive and
that is what people agree to

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/460-2
00:03:18.046 --> 00:03:18.991
describe it as.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/467-0
00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:20.381
So does that clarify?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/501-0
00:03:21.961 --> 00:03:25.373
So it doesn't mean that in the
future you cannot use it for

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/501-1
00:03:25.373 --> 00:03:28.671
some thing like inventory
management, you want to predict

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/501-2
00:03:28.671 --> 00:03:30.491
inventory, maybe you can use it.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/523-0
00:03:30.851 --> 00:03:35.146
But then association task is
only finding the rules based on

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/523-1
00:03:35.146 --> 00:03:39.511
the past data and the experts
called it decision descriptive.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/553-0
00:03:39.941 --> 00:03:43.069
So let's go with it and any
issue I think that is what we

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/553-1
00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.982
discussed in the class in the
first session, what the

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/553-2
00:03:45.982 --> 00:03:46.791
association is.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/557-0
00:03:47.301 --> 00:03:47.741
Uh.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/577-0
00:03:48.141 --> 00:03:51.935
A descriptive so so, but then
someone is still has a doubt

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/577-1
00:03:51.935 --> 00:03:53.671
saying that OK association.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/595-0
00:03:53.781 --> 00:03:57.550
I think I myself may have
mentioned that association can

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/590-0
00:03:56.821 --> 00:03:57.031
Yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/595-1
00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:58.741
also be used, yes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/593-0
00:03:59.681 --> 00:03:59.911
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/597-0
00:03:59.921 --> 00:04:00.251
Would you?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/606-0
00:04:01.891 --> 00:04:03.401
Yes, somebody is asking your
question.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/609-0
00:04:03.411 --> 00:04:03.851
Please go ahead.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/636-0
00:04:08.111 --> 00:04:12.949
Is someone asking a question or
or or OK it was in noise coming

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/636-1
00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:14.461
from somebody's mic.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/638-0
00:04:14.551 --> 00:04:14.841
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/641-0
00:04:14.851 --> 00:04:15.521
OK. OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/646-0
00:04:15.531 --> 00:04:16.601
Thank you, Mr Rajesh.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/654-0
00:04:16.611 --> 00:04:17.881
Good that you reminded it.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/672-0
00:04:18.511 --> 00:04:23.850
So if somebody is having a doubt
but still not able to somehow

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/672-1
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.291
not bringing out.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/675-0
00:04:25.451 --> 00:04:26.261
Yeah, it helps.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/692-0
00:04:26.511 --> 00:04:30.086
So the idea is that we have to
go with sit and conventions in

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/692-1
00:04:30.086 --> 00:04:30.721
everything.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/718-0
00:04:30.731 --> 00:04:35.195
For example, let's go into the
our school days, our school days

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/718-1
00:04:35.195 --> 00:04:38.961
when we were studying and you
can see lots of motion.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/728-0
00:04:39.451 --> 00:04:41.131
Everybody says this is the first
line.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/733-0
00:04:41.141 --> 00:04:41.851
This is second law.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/750-0
00:04:41.861 --> 00:04:44.884
This is third law, but you
cannot say that the third law is

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/750-1
00:04:44.884 --> 00:04:45.841
looking very basic.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/763-0
00:04:45.851 --> 00:04:47.321
So I want to put it as a first
level.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/775-0
00:04:47.331 --> 00:04:49.492
In that case you will have
difficulty communicating with

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/775-1
00:04:49.492 --> 00:04:50.251
anybody else, right?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/805-0
00:04:50.871 --> 00:04:54.656
So in any case that there is a
reason why association is called

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/805-1
00:04:54.656 --> 00:04:57.731
as a descriptive because it is
giving you a, it is.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/838-0
00:04:57.831 --> 00:05:01.666
The rules are found only by
studying the the data and

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/838-1
00:05:01.666 --> 00:05:06.141
there's sociation mining is done
once you find the rules so so

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/838-2
00:05:06.141 --> 00:05:07.491
that is the reason.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/850-0
00:05:08.301 --> 00:05:10.891
OK, Mr Bishop Sukhada is ideas.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/858-0
00:05:10.901 --> 00:05:12.511
Assignment will be given after
mid semester.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/861-0
00:05:17.921 --> 00:05:18.551
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/870-0
00:05:18.601 --> 00:05:20.811
And so we'll proceed further.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/873-0
00:05:20.881 --> 00:05:22.541
I hope things are clear.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/882-0
00:05:30.741 --> 00:05:33.311
So we had discussed about the.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/890-0
00:05:35.531 --> 00:05:38.041
So let me put them in writing.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/909-0
00:05:41.511 --> 00:05:45.121
Answer One question related to
the quiz if that's fine.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/917-0
00:05:44.881 --> 00:05:46.311
Yes, yes, yes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/942-0
00:05:46.071 --> 00:05:49.280
So on the cheese quest, Sir, on
that key square, if the key

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/942-1
00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.490
square is larger, it means that
attributes are not related,

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/942-2
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.811
right?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/947-0
00:05:54.281 --> 00:05:55.521
K Square test, right?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/950-0
00:05:55.561 --> 00:05:55.771
Yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/953-0
00:05:55.781 --> 00:05:56.251
Yeah, right.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/962-0
00:05:55.921 --> 00:05:56.081
Yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/957-0
00:05:56.301 --> 00:05:56.551
Right.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/968-0
00:05:56.601 --> 00:05:59.401
If it is lower, less than that,
yes, yes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/975-0
00:06:00.271 --> 00:06:02.401
So, Mr Basavaraju right?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/981-0
00:06:02.411 --> 00:06:02.761
Yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/991-0
00:06:02.771 --> 00:06:04.751
So So what is the question?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/985-0
00:06:02.861 --> 00:06:03.211
Yes, Sir.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1016-0
00:06:05.531 --> 00:06:08.912
So you guys square value is
between 2 nominal attributes is

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1016-1
00:06:08.912 --> 00:06:12.181
larger means those attributes
are not related, right Sir?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1017-0
00:06:12.681 --> 00:06:13.681
No, no, they are related.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1042-0
00:06:15.841 --> 00:06:19.658
So Ayer the value means it
related and lower value means it

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1042-1
00:06:19.658 --> 00:06:20.421
not related.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1053-0
00:06:20.141 --> 00:06:24.301
Lower is essentially close to 0
is that there is no relation.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1059-0
00:06:25.451 --> 00:06:25.831
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1060-0
00:06:25.791 --> 00:06:27.511
Yes, zero is no relation.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1062-0
00:06:27.521 --> 00:06:29.251
Yes, OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1072-0
00:06:38.301 --> 00:06:40.341
OK, Miss Pratima has a question.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1077-0
00:06:43.141 --> 00:06:46.741
Smoothing aggregation,
normalization.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1086-0
00:06:48.661 --> 00:06:51.111
Not part of the data
transformation.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1097-0
00:06:52.811 --> 00:06:55.391
OK, Miss Pratima, what do you
think is the answer?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1105-0
00:06:57.841 --> 00:06:59.611
We are talking about data
transformation.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1116-0
00:07:03.311 --> 00:07:04.181
Miss PRITIBALA, you.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1137-0
00:07:04.191 --> 00:07:07.583
I think you can speak your
microphone is ohh smoothing, but

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1137-1
00:07:07.583 --> 00:07:09.901
smoothing is doing
transformation right.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1146-0
00:07:09.911 --> 00:07:13.091
It is doing some approximations
of the values.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1157-0
00:07:13.101 --> 00:07:15.091
If you are getting the values
which are close.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1172-0
00:07:16.201 --> 00:07:20.351
Ah yes, Mr Regenera says it is a
aggregation, right.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1206-0
00:07:20.401 --> 00:07:25.044
Aggregation is a reasonable
because The thing is that the

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1206-1
00:07:25.044 --> 00:07:29.927
aggregate the try it is not
really doing a transformation of

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1206-2
00:07:29.927 --> 00:07:35.051
the data right when suppose that
you have you have the support.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1211-0
00:07:35.421 --> 00:07:37.231
Yeah, I suppose.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1213-0
00:07:37.241 --> 00:07:37.431
What?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1218-0
00:07:37.441 --> 00:07:38.311
What can that be?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1268-0
00:07:38.381 --> 00:07:42.578
Suppose that there is a some
scoring goals related some

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1268-1
00:07:42.578 --> 00:07:47.451
football, football related data
set and there is a team which is

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1268-2
00:07:47.451 --> 00:07:51.873
scoring some goals in all the
matches and somehow you also

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1268-3
00:07:51.873 --> 00:07:56.071
wanted to find which team has
scored the maximum goals.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1278-0
00:07:56.541 --> 00:07:59.331
So then you are not transforming
the data right?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1287-0
00:07:59.381 --> 00:08:01.351
You are only adding Miss
Pratima.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1296-0
00:08:01.361 --> 00:08:02.771
Are you there or you're not?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1308-0
00:08:02.781 --> 00:08:06.721
There you asked and then you
became quite yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1312-0
00:08:06.811 --> 00:08:07.651
Are you fine?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1316-0
00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:09.251
OK, OK alright.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1328-0
00:08:10.521 --> 00:08:14.355
So anyone else remembering
something that we can quickly

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1328-1
00:08:14.355 --> 00:08:14.691
take?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1330-0
00:08:14.781 --> 00:08:15.121
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1332-0
00:08:15.131 --> 00:08:15.461
Thank you.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1337-0
00:08:24.121 --> 00:08:24.671
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1340-0
00:08:24.721 --> 00:08:26.441
So we talked about
classification.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1347-0
00:08:29.931 --> 00:08:31.441
We looked at three heuristics.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1362-0
00:08:34.581 --> 00:08:39.341
To be we we looked at a greedy
approach to build the tree.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1366-0
00:08:41.971 --> 00:08:42.871
Oh yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1370-0
00:08:45.801 --> 00:08:47.201
Big decision trees.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1380-0
00:08:49.421 --> 00:08:53.591
And then there are three
heuristics which are Jenny.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1386-0
00:08:57.431 --> 00:08:59.681
Entropy and error.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1396-0
00:09:01.851 --> 00:09:04.541
I hope uh, it's so far so good.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1405-0
00:09:04.871 --> 00:09:08.611
OK, so so now now I'm hoping
that.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1412-0
00:09:12.021 --> 00:09:12.571
So.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1446-0
00:09:12.621 --> 00:09:17.771
So with that, So what we have
seen is that I we mentioned

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1446-1
00:09:17.771 --> 00:09:23.365
about the gain ratio, there are
some algorithms that are there

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1446-2
00:09:23.365 --> 00:09:25.851
in the there in the library.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1458-0
00:09:25.861 --> 00:09:29.741
So you can you build the the
entry using the Python.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1519-0
00:09:29.751 --> 00:09:33.461
There are, uh, cyclic has the
has the function and it is

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1519-1
00:09:33.461 --> 00:09:36.976
possible that there are more
libraries which have got

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1519-2
00:09:36.976 --> 00:09:41.207
differently and each person will
be writing the program in their

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1519-3
00:09:41.207 --> 00:09:44.917
own way, maybe with some
variations and and we have seen

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1519-4
00:09:44.917 --> 00:09:47.911
that there is one way which the
an algorithm.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1522-0
00:09:47.961 --> 00:09:48.871
I think it is.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1534-0
00:09:49.301 --> 00:09:51.131
I don't remember the algorithm
named.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1552-0
00:09:51.141 --> 00:09:57.081
The tree is used for the C 4.5
which is using easy.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1579-0
00:09:57.391 --> 00:10:03.739
The gain ratio gain ratio is
used by C 4.5 and what it does

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1579-1
00:10:03.739 --> 00:10:08.711
is that it is getting the gain
in the entropy.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1585-0
00:10:09.151 --> 00:10:11.401
OK, so you get the.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1587-0
00:10:16.221 --> 00:10:16.861
Compute.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1591-0
00:10:20.691 --> 00:10:22.481
Gain in entropy.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1595-0
00:10:27.181 --> 00:10:29.061
For all attributes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1606-0
00:10:32.671 --> 00:10:36.511
And then divide by this split
information.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1646-0
00:10:36.881 --> 00:10:41.918
So what we do is that we divide
the gain by split information

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1646-1
00:10:41.918 --> 00:10:46.549
for the attribute so that the
attribute which creates 20

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1646-2
00:10:46.549 --> 00:10:51.505
branches or 60 branches even
though it is creating pure data

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1646-3
00:10:51.505 --> 00:10:51.911
sets.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1674-0
00:10:52.501 --> 00:10:56.440
We do not want to give it the
higher weight is we want to give

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1674-1
00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:59.753
higher weight is too the
attributes which do minimum

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1674-2
00:10:59.753 --> 00:11:00.191
splits.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1689-0
00:11:00.201 --> 00:11:02.758
But at the same time, they're
going to give you a significant

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1689-1
00:11:02.758 --> 00:11:03.831
improvement in the purity.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1704-0
00:11:04.371 --> 00:11:08.101
OK, so that was the concept that
we last discussed in the class.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1712-0
00:11:08.431 --> 00:11:10.521
So that goes beyond these
heuristics.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1716-0
00:11:10.531 --> 00:11:11.141
So.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1749-0
00:11:11.201 --> 00:11:15.441
So the point is, these are the
simple level heuristics, Gini

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1749-1
00:11:15.441 --> 00:11:19.889
entropy error, and then you can
complicate them and thereby you

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1749-2
00:11:19.889 --> 00:11:23.921
can get a better, more simple,
more explainable decision.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1774-0
00:11:24.171 --> 00:11:27.638
OK, so now let us look at what
is the way in which we can

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1774-1
00:11:27.638 --> 00:11:29.671
refine the decision tree
further.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1794-0
00:11:30.881 --> 00:11:34.551
So we want to look at are Mr
Amit Chaudhary, are you trying

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1794-1
00:11:34.551 --> 00:11:35.591
to say something?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1797-0
00:11:36.531 --> 00:11:36.801
Uh.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1815-0
00:11:36.811 --> 00:11:39.550
Because I'm or you may want to
mute yourself because it shows

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1815-1
00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:40.831
that you are trying to speak.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1818-0
00:11:43.431 --> 00:11:43.731
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1827-0
00:11:45.231 --> 00:11:46.841
Yes, Mr Kapil Gargi, you are
there.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1850-0
00:11:47.271 --> 00:11:50.446
OK, you're there in the class,
so I hope we discussed about

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1846-0
00:11:49.041 --> 00:11:49.361
Yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1850-1
00:11:50.446 --> 00:11:51.981
your doubt before you joined.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1871-0
00:11:52.811 --> 00:11:57.751
Is there anything that uh, you
want you want to ask?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1865-0
00:11:57.911 --> 00:11:58.321
No, said.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1867-0
00:11:58.331 --> 00:11:58.801
I'm good.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1869-0
00:11:58.811 --> 00:11:59.101
Yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1877-0
00:11:59.111 --> 00:11:59.451
Thank you.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1875-0
00:11:59.831 --> 00:12:00.261
Thank you.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1878-0
00:12:00.311 --> 00:12:01.011
Alright. OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1911-0
00:12:02.481 --> 00:12:06.890
So those who are not speaking,
please mute your mic so that I

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1911-1
00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:10.588
don't get a confusion that
somebody's trying to say

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1911-2
00:12:10.588 --> 00:12:12.081
something and uh, OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1936-0
00:12:18.801 --> 00:12:24.141
OK, so so The thing is that we
worked we we looked at a toy

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1936-1
00:12:24.141 --> 00:12:26.811
data set, right, we looked at.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1943-0
00:12:30.621 --> 00:12:32.551
That is small data set.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1958-0
00:12:35.641 --> 00:12:39.811
And it was possible for us to
build all pure leaves.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1985-0
00:12:40.061 --> 00:12:43.150
All the leaves were pure because
when we worked with the taxi

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/1985-1
00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:45.991
wage and dataset, which is
small, we got all the leaves.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2041-0
00:12:46.241 --> 00:12:50.529
But then but then it is possible
that you may get a data set

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2041-1
00:12:50.529 --> 00:12:55.028
which has got 1,000,000 records
and then you start dividing and

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2041-2
00:12:55.028 --> 00:12:59.105
then even after going 10
branches down the tree 10 levels

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2041-3
00:12:59.105 --> 00:13:02.971
down from the root, you may
still not get pure leaves.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2065-0
00:13:03.301 --> 00:13:07.235
So at that point you think you
have to think in terms of an

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2065-1
00:13:07.235 --> 00:13:10.711
early termination because these
are all good things.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2077-0
00:13:10.721 --> 00:13:13.581
So if you get a pure your note.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2089-0
00:13:15.221 --> 00:13:17.671
There's just the for me.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2107-0
00:13:17.561 --> 00:13:20.863
And impossible situation when
all attributes are the same

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2107-1
00:13:20.863 --> 00:13:23.141
value, then it is impossible
situation.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2131-0
00:13:24.081 --> 00:13:27.634
So those are the two extreme
things, but then even otherwise,

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2113-0
00:13:24.101 --> 00:13:24.331
Yep.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2131-1
00:13:27.634 --> 00:13:30.271
when you got a very large data
set, you will.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2153-0
00:13:30.281 --> 00:13:33.609
You're never going to get either
of the situation, so you need to

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2153-1
00:13:33.609 --> 00:13:34.971
think of early termination.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2166-0
00:13:35.061 --> 00:13:38.491
So in that context, let's look
at some of the issues.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2173-0
00:13:38.801 --> 00:13:40.811
So when we build a classifier.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2209-0
00:13:45.281 --> 00:13:49.749
And in our case, the example is
a decision tree and it holds for

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2209-1
00:13:49.749 --> 00:13:54.147
any many other classifiers that
you may learn in this course or

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2209-2
00:13:54.147 --> 00:13:55.591
in the other courses.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2233-0
00:13:56.021 --> 00:14:01.372
So the problem is that you may
have a classifier that is either

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2245-0
00:13:56.621 --> 00:13:56.891
No.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2233-1
00:14:01.372 --> 00:14:03.211
doing an underfitting.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2257-0
00:14:03.601 --> 00:14:07.306
So we are saying that we will
only use one attribute and get

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2257-1
00:14:07.306 --> 00:14:10.161
some level of accuracy and then
we stop there.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2276-0
00:14:10.871 --> 00:14:14.826
So in the tax dataset, what we
said is let's say we decide

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2276-1
00:14:14.826 --> 00:14:15.161
that.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2284-0
00:14:15.811 --> 00:14:19.731
So I will use only one attribute
which is income.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2316-0
00:14:21.471 --> 00:14:25.800
And then greater than 95K, and
I'm saying that if it is greater

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2295-0
00:14:21.761 --> 00:14:22.071
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2316-1
00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:28.641
than this, this is known and
This is why.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2339-0
00:14:28.951 --> 00:14:33.935
So this is a very simple and
very highly interpretable a

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2339-1
00:14:33.935 --> 00:14:39.619
decision tree, but the question
is that this is both of them are

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2339-2
00:14:39.619 --> 00:14:40.231
impure.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2348-0
00:14:44.481 --> 00:14:45.531
So is this.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2381-0
00:14:45.581 --> 00:14:50.599
This is called underfitting, so
we are building something very

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2381-1
00:14:50.599 --> 00:14:55.616
simple and so the accuracy will
be low and it will have a very

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2381-2
00:14:55.616 --> 00:14:59.041
superior interpretability and
overfitting.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2414-0
00:14:59.051 --> 00:15:02.132
Is that suppose you got a data
set which is running into

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2414-1
00:15:02.132 --> 00:15:05.322
hundreds of thousands of data
and then you said that no, I

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2414-2
00:15:05.322 --> 00:15:06.241
want pure leaves.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2419-0
00:15:06.511 --> 00:15:07.781
All the all the pure leaves.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2451-0
00:15:07.941 --> 00:15:10.564
And then you are willing to go
all the way up to the 100th

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2451-1
00:15:10.564 --> 00:15:13.321
level in the dish entry, and
then you're going to get purely.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2479-0
00:15:13.971 --> 00:15:18.677
But the problem is that in such
cases the date the classified

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2479-1
00:15:18.677 --> 00:15:22.701
tends to be more complex than
the real world events.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2505-0
00:15:23.611 --> 00:15:26.725
So in that case we are going to
get a zero training error

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2505-1
00:15:26.725 --> 00:15:30.001
because the with the training
data it is giving pure leaves.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2531-0
00:15:30.631 --> 00:15:35.691
That is, each leaf node is
representing a pure class, but

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2531-1
00:15:35.691 --> 00:15:41.013
then once we start testing with
test data, so we will have a

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2531-2
00:15:41.013 --> 00:15:41.711
problem.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2538-0
00:15:41.781 --> 00:15:44.321
So if we have two simple.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2558-0
00:15:49.161 --> 00:15:52.463
So in that case it has got a
significant error, so this is

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2558-1
00:15:52.463 --> 00:15:53.751
representing the error.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2573-0
00:15:53.761 --> 00:15:57.221
I hope you're able to read this
and then this is the.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2584-0
00:15:57.381 --> 00:15:59.751
This is the complexity of the
tree number of nodes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2622-0
00:15:59.761 --> 00:16:04.256
That is what we are putting it
so when it has very few nodes it

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2622-1
00:16:04.256 --> 00:16:08.190
is very simple but then the
error will be high and then

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2622-2
00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:11.351
suppose that you ended up with
very complex.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2624-0
00:16:11.761 --> 00:16:12.901
Suppose 100 nodes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2631-0
00:16:13.791 --> 00:16:15.881
OK, so it is too complex.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2642-0
00:16:22.751 --> 00:16:24.581
With two complex what is
happening?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2650-0
00:16:24.821 --> 00:16:27.241
We are getting nearly zero
training error.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2663-0
00:16:27.311 --> 00:16:32.401
The training error the blue line
is representing the training

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2663-1
00:16:32.401 --> 00:16:33.551
error that is.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2709-0
00:16:33.821 --> 00:16:38.436
Check with the training data and
then how it is performing, but

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2709-1
00:16:38.436 --> 00:16:42.835
then with the test data it is
giving more and more errors so

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2709-2
00:16:42.835 --> 00:16:46.657
you can see that with
underfitting the both training

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2709-3
00:16:46.657 --> 00:16:48.821
and test errors are very high.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2729-0
00:16:48.831 --> 00:16:52.540
But once we do, the overfitting
training error becomes very very

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2729-1
00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:54.081
small and may even go to 0.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2738-0
00:16:54.351 --> 00:16:56.531
But the test error is going to
be large.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2757-0
00:16:57.731 --> 00:17:02.476
So so now the challenge is that
challenge is that we don't want

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2757-1
00:17:02.476 --> 00:17:04.181
to go for underfitting.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2770-0
00:17:04.591 --> 00:17:05.451
Let us avoid that.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2780-0
00:17:04.941 --> 00:17:08.964
So that so can you give example
of that the training error and

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2780-1
00:17:08.964 --> 00:17:10.241
the test error? How?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2787-0
00:17:12.071 --> 00:17:12.471
That one.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2789-0
00:17:12.541 --> 00:17:13.931
OK, OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2796-0
00:17:13.941 --> 00:17:16.541
So now let us go to the data
set.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2825-0
00:17:18.121 --> 00:17:22.687
This data set OK, so let us
still stick with this data set

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2825-1
00:17:22.687 --> 00:17:26.711
because I'll I'll otherwise have
a A so it becomes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2839-0
00:17:26.921 --> 00:17:30.141
OK, so now let us say we build a
decision tree.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2837-0
00:17:27.941 --> 00:17:28.131
You.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2843-0
00:17:33.271 --> 00:17:33.771
Uh.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2853-0
00:17:36.641 --> 00:17:38.901
Income. Great.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2858-0
00:17:38.611 --> 00:17:40.261
Sorry to interrupt, sorry.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2860-0
00:17:39.941 --> 00:17:41.481
And then 95K.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2885-0
00:17:43.451 --> 00:17:46.641
Yes, somebody has a question
greater than 95K.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2869-0
00:17:43.841 --> 00:17:44.581
He's mute.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2872-0
00:17:44.591 --> 00:17:44.781
Mute.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2879-0
00:17:45.611 --> 00:17:46.201
Yes, Sir.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2888-0
00:17:46.211 --> 00:17:48.731
I'm just so just I'm requesting.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2897-0
00:17:48.741 --> 00:17:50.671
Can you please mute Amit
Chaudhary?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2901-0
00:17:50.681 --> 00:17:51.491
He's uh.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2912-0
00:17:51.501 --> 00:17:54.341
He's forget to mute the mic mic
and.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2913-0
00:17:55.511 --> 00:17:55.871
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2933-0
00:17:57.981 --> 00:18:02.117
OK, just let me let me check,
dear, let me finish this income

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2933-1
00:18:02.117 --> 00:18:03.251
greater than 95K.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2943-0
00:18:03.261 --> 00:18:09.771
So how many are there, 1234?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2959-0
00:18:09.931 --> 00:18:16.671
OK, 4 tuples, 4 tuples and 1234.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2967-0
00:18:17.731 --> 00:18:19.461
OK, so this is not good.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2980-0
00:18:19.611 --> 00:18:21.481
This is not good, so I'll go for
something.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2983-0
00:18:21.491 --> 00:18:22.141
Some of that number.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2988-0
00:18:22.191 --> 00:18:22.561
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2993-0
00:18:23.231 --> 00:18:25.051
I'll go for 85K, OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/2999-0
00:18:27.211 --> 00:18:27.881
85 came.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3002-0
00:18:33.791 --> 00:18:34.121
No.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3037-0
00:18:39.961 --> 00:18:49.173
85 K OK, 85K is, so maybe let me
make it 84 K OK 84K greater than

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3037-1
00:18:49.173 --> 00:18:49.731
84K.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3052-0
00:18:49.741 --> 00:18:50.291
How many I've.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3064-0
00:18:50.301 --> 00:19:00.931
I've got 1234567 OK seven tuples
on this side greater than uh.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3067-0
00:19:04.511 --> 00:19:05.751
OK so.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3070-0
00:19:08.881 --> 00:19:09.711
So true.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3077-0
00:19:13.911 --> 00:19:14.581
Falls.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3087-0
00:19:15.411 --> 00:19:17.781
So I have 7 tuples here and
three tuples here.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3089-0
00:19:17.831 --> 00:19:18.111
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3109-0
00:19:18.121 --> 00:19:25.331
Greater than 84K and three
tuples are 70K60K and 75K.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3119-0
00:19:27.051 --> 00:19:31.851
OK, so so now now the problem is
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3121-0
00:19:35.601 --> 00:19:35.921
Let's.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3149-0
00:19:53.011 --> 00:19:57.694
So now let us look at the
dataset so so this decision tree

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3149-1
00:19:57.694 --> 00:19:59.441
is very simple, right?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3159-0
00:20:01.671 --> 00:20:03.421
But now look at this.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3183-0
00:20:11.821 --> 00:20:12.211
The other.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3201-0
00:20:12.291 --> 00:20:18.981
Uh Ford knows and two yeses and
here 1S and three nodes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3214-0
00:20:20.271 --> 00:20:24.951
So so we can see that the the
trees.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3228-0
00:20:24.961 --> 00:20:29.311
Simple, but then it is not
helping us to solve the problem.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3233-0
00:20:30.131 --> 00:20:30.491
You guys.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3236-0
00:20:30.561 --> 00:20:32.671
So does that underfitting help?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3254-0
00:20:33.081 --> 00:20:36.927
So if we have more bigger tree,
we can we'll be able to solve

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3267-0
00:20:33.581 --> 00:20:33.841
Thank you.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3254-1
00:20:36.927 --> 00:20:37.671
the problem.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3262-0
00:20:40.161 --> 00:20:40.931
Is that clear?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3266-0
00:20:40.941 --> 00:20:42.271
Or somebody still has it out.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3282-0
00:20:46.281 --> 00:20:48.591
Let's talk you can.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3277-0
00:20:47.081 --> 00:20:47.631
Look at some.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3288-0
00:20:48.031 --> 00:20:51.981
I think am I allowed to mute
which?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3287-0
00:20:51.701 --> 00:20:51.881
You know.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3321-0
00:21:03.041 --> 00:21:04.561
But we work.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3300-0
00:21:06.421 --> 00:21:06.911
I don't know.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3302-0
00:21:06.921 --> 00:21:07.451
It is not.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3308-0
00:21:07.461 --> 00:21:08.611
It is not showing.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3318-0
00:21:08.621 --> 00:21:12.681
I have to go and check find the
person.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3329-0
00:21:13.861 --> 00:21:15.571
Some mute all and then unmute.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3340-0
00:21:15.151 --> 00:21:17.241
So ohh.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3336-0
00:21:16.641 --> 00:21:17.331
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3346-0
00:21:16.841 --> 00:21:17.911
I didn't do that work.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3338-0
00:21:17.381 --> 00:21:17.771
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3341-0
00:21:18.121 --> 00:21:18.631
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3371-0
00:21:18.681 --> 00:21:23.010
OK, before I before I do that,
the underfitting overfitting

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3371-1
00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:27.196
there is one person with a
problem is that clear or or me

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3371-2
00:21:27.196 --> 00:21:27.701
are we?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3383-0
00:21:27.451 --> 00:21:27.561
Yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3382-0
00:21:30.651 --> 00:21:33.526
Who asked that question about
Underfitting and overfitting

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3382-1
00:21:33.526 --> 00:21:34.111
explanation.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3392-0
00:21:41.871 --> 00:21:43.111
Somebody asked for it, right?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3402-0
00:21:44.351 --> 00:21:46.321
And OK, I I'm not able to.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3404-0
00:21:46.371 --> 00:21:46.761
Yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3412-0
00:21:46.531 --> 00:21:47.071
Yes miss.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3408-0
00:21:46.771 --> 00:21:47.761
I asked about.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3410-0
00:21:47.811 --> 00:21:48.241
Yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3437-0
00:21:48.251 --> 00:21:57.125
I asked about the test data and
ohh A oh can you go back to that

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3437-1
00:21:57.125 --> 00:21:57.671
one?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3449-0
00:21:58.241 --> 00:22:01.031
I was confused with that one
that slide please.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3461-0
00:22:01.521 --> 00:22:06.931
OK, so suppose that we we
created this type of tree.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3467-0
00:22:07.101 --> 00:22:08.311
It is very simple, right?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3480-0
00:22:08.321 --> 00:22:10.121
Missouri, you agree it is
simple, right?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3486-0
00:22:10.761 --> 00:22:11.551
Yes, yes, yes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3505-0
00:22:12.551 --> 00:22:15.285
It is simple, but do you think
that it is going to help the

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3505-1
00:22:15.285 --> 00:22:16.971
income tax authorities
sufficiently?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3542-0
00:22:18.621 --> 00:22:22.723
No, no, no, because we are not
getting the clear cut indication

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3527-0
00:22:22.641 --> 00:22:24.011
Yes. See.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3542-1
00:22:22.723 --> 00:22:25.671
with whatever the dividing
technique we have.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3530-0
00:22:24.461 --> 00:22:24.951
Yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3556-0
00:22:25.001 --> 00:22:28.953
See and also and also we need to
think that there are three

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3556-1
00:22:28.953 --> 00:22:31.391
attributes which seem to be
helpful.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3589-0
00:22:31.721 --> 00:22:34.364
But we are using only one
attribute but in real problem

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3589-1
00:22:34.364 --> 00:22:37.478
there may be 20 attributes which
are useful and we are using only

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3589-2
00:22:37.478 --> 00:22:38.611
two or three attributes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3605-0
00:22:38.981 --> 00:22:44.111
So in that case it is unlikely
that this is going to help.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3607-0
00:22:44.201 --> 00:22:45.161
So this is underfitting.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3618-0
00:22:47.551 --> 00:22:48.451
OK, Sir. OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3627-0
00:22:48.671 --> 00:22:51.941
So overfitting is that we are
trying to use everything.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3642-0
00:22:51.951 --> 00:22:54.628
In this case the overfitting may
not be because there are only

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3642-1
00:22:54.628 --> 00:22:55.351
three attributes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3686-0
00:22:55.361 --> 00:22:59.299
You will say that still it is
simple, but then you may have a

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3686-1
00:22:59.299 --> 00:23:03.301
data set with 10 attributes or
100 attributes and you create a

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3686-2
00:23:03.301 --> 00:23:07.175
very complex decision tree and
with using all 100 attributes

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3686-3
00:23:07.175 --> 00:23:09.081
then that becomes overfitting.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3733-0
00:23:09.931 --> 00:23:14.521
So that overfitting is that in
such cases it is noticed that

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3733-1
00:23:14.521 --> 00:23:19.186
with training error training
data we may get 100 zero percent

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3727-0
00:23:15.671 --> 00:23:18.591
Yeah, more than just now
correctly.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3733-2
00:23:19.186 --> 00:23:20.691
error 100% accuracy.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3746-0
00:23:20.861 --> 00:23:24.857
But with the test data, they
generally end up with higher

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3746-1
00:23:24.857 --> 00:23:25.271
error.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3747-0
00:23:25.301 --> 00:23:25.731
Angola.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3756-0
00:23:30.411 --> 00:23:32.411
OK, I'm going to.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3758-0
00:23:31.231 --> 00:23:31.471
Umm.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3760-0
00:23:32.581 --> 00:23:33.171
I'm going to.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3780-0
00:23:34.401 --> 00:23:37.361
OK, I'm what I'm doing and.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3776-0
00:23:34.791 --> 00:23:35.881
Gale, though.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3781-0
00:23:36.591 --> 00:23:38.131
Amit, can you mute yourself?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3790-0
00:23:40.491 --> 00:23:43.441
OK, I'm going to disable the mic
for.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3802-0
00:23:45.231 --> 00:23:48.101
OK, let only for Amit Chaudhary
maybe helps.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3824-0
00:23:56.151 --> 00:24:03.021
OK, so now now let us look at
the the problem.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3822-0
00:23:59.411 --> 00:24:01.331
Over Anand mentioned just said.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3839-0
00:24:03.111 --> 00:24:07.311
So what we are saying is that
with yes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3849-0
00:24:05.851 --> 00:24:10.121
But it is still not muted, so I
think.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3863-0
00:24:11.121 --> 00:24:15.641
I muted only for or person who
who could not mute himself.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3864-0
00:24:14.411 --> 00:24:15.791
Ohh and.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3876-0
00:24:18.541 --> 00:24:19.771
Are you still hearing some?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3879-0
00:24:18.681 --> 00:24:19.361
There's more people.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3904-0
00:24:20.541 --> 00:24:21.891
So should I mute every game?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3915-0
00:24:21.311 --> 00:24:24.183
It mute all of us there because
more and more people are here,

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3906-0
00:24:23.111 --> 00:24:23.401
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3915-1
00:24:24.183 --> 00:24:24.411
yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3908-0
00:24:24.811 --> 00:24:25.101
Yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3910-0
00:24:25.111 --> 00:24:25.341
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3912-0
00:24:25.351 --> 00:24:25.561
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3919-0
00:24:25.571 --> 00:24:26.501
OK, fine, I'll do that.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3933-0
00:24:28.291 --> 00:24:31.511
So I'll unmute after 10 minutes
and then then we can discuss.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3981-0
00:24:45.301 --> 00:24:49.564
So in such cases, when we have a
very complex decision tree with

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3981-1
00:24:49.564 --> 00:24:53.630
hundred nodes, so in that case
the test data, it is not going

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/3981-2
00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:57.631
to do well because we try to
overfit with the training data.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4005-0
00:24:58.001 --> 00:25:01.638
So, but then we have to know
that training data, everything

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4005-1
00:25:01.638 --> 00:25:04.851
in the training data cannot be
treated like a Bible.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4044-0
00:25:05.281 --> 00:25:10.018
So we need to stop at some place
and may have to accept a little

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4044-1
00:25:10.018 --> 00:25:14.317
bit of error and then create a
tree which and then which a

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4044-2
00:25:14.317 --> 00:25:17.451
domain expert can understand or
interpret.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4064-0
00:25:17.951 --> 00:25:21.308
Because if we keep going on
building a very, very complex

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4064-1
00:25:21.308 --> 00:25:23.681
tree, then the test error will
be large.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4071-0
00:25:24.131 --> 00:25:26.181
So how to avoid the
overshooting?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4080-0
00:25:26.311 --> 00:25:27.681
So we can do it in two ways.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4091-0
00:25:27.691 --> 00:25:29.421
One is that we can do a pre
pruning.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4110-0
00:25:31.171 --> 00:25:34.774
Pre pruning is that we stop
early, so stop the algorithm

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4110-1
00:25:34.774 --> 00:25:36.101
before it becomes so.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4116-0
00:25:36.111 --> 00:25:37.981
When so that can be.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4141-0
00:25:38.071 --> 00:25:41.862
This is a general situation, so
this is we already talked about

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4141-1
00:25:41.862 --> 00:25:45.061
all the same class, then and
then the same attribute.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4159-0
00:25:45.071 --> 00:25:47.860
This is impossible to
differentiate them because same

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4159-1
00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:49.771
attribute values for all the
tuples.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4177-0
00:25:50.611 --> 00:25:53.913
So in that case general
condition but then we will go

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4177-1
00:25:53.913 --> 00:25:57.031
for a more restrictive
conditions for termination.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4192-0
00:25:58.001 --> 00:26:02.606
So we will stop if the number of
instances is less than some

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4192-1
00:26:02.606 --> 00:26:03.361
threshold.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4240-0
00:26:03.831 --> 00:26:08.779
So if there are only 10 tuples
in certain paths, we don't go

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4240-1
00:26:08.779 --> 00:26:13.726
proceed further and then we meet
also run Kai Square test to

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4240-2
00:26:13.726 --> 00:26:18.999
check if the class and then the
attributes do have some level of

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4240-3
00:26:18.999 --> 00:26:19.891
dependence.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4285-0
00:26:20.781 --> 00:26:24.631
Otherwise, if they are
independent then also we are

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4285-1
00:26:24.631 --> 00:26:28.850
going to stop and then we also
checked the Gini or other

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4285-2
00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:32.922
impurity measures and we see
that the gain that we are

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4285-3
00:26:32.922 --> 00:26:34.551
getting is very small.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4331-0
00:26:34.561 --> 00:26:40.558
It is only .01 so we can specify
such criteria and thereby we are

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4331-1
00:26:40.558 --> 00:26:45.828
going to, uh, going to stop
early and it is also possible

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4331-2
00:26:45.828 --> 00:26:51.371
that sometimes we make take a
similar thing but we can do it

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4331-3
00:26:51.371 --> 00:26:52.461
differently.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4361-0
00:26:52.871 --> 00:26:57.009
We build the entire tree and
then we start studying, which is

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4361-1
00:26:57.009 --> 00:27:01.013
the part of the tree that we
should prove so that we can do

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4361-2
00:27:01.013 --> 00:27:02.081
it in many ways.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4375-0
00:27:02.531 --> 00:27:06.751
So this is becoming essentially
a bottom up way of pruning.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4398-0
00:27:07.251 --> 00:27:13.576
So we can keep, we can keep
checking with some test records

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4398-1
00:27:13.576 --> 00:27:17.161
and see if we prune some
subtree.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4447-0
00:27:17.241 --> 00:27:21.595
Is it going to improve so that
is how we are going to we run

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4447-1
00:27:21.595 --> 00:27:26.092
the tree on some test data and
we start looking for the places

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4447-2
00:27:26.092 --> 00:27:30.803
where there are errors and there
we are going to trim and replace

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4447-3
00:27:30.803 --> 00:27:31.731
it by a leaf.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4459-0
00:27:34.721 --> 00:27:37.311
So what is the advantage of a
decision tree?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4493-0
00:27:37.561 --> 00:27:43.648
It is relatively inexpensive and
it can, if it's a simple tree

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4493-1
00:27:43.648 --> 00:27:49.832
and then it is interpretable and
by and large it is fast and it

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4493-2
00:27:49.832 --> 00:27:52.731
also gets reasonable accuracy.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4509-0
00:27:53.181 --> 00:27:57.720
OK, so that is about the
decision trees that we wanted to

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4509-1
00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:58.111
talk.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4517-0
00:27:58.121 --> 00:27:59.751
We will go into the new topic.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4525-0
00:28:00.301 --> 00:28:02.641
So which is a rule based
classifier?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4540-0
00:28:05.031 --> 00:28:08.721
So so before I go there, I'm not
seeing any messages.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4551-0
00:28:08.731 --> 00:28:13.321
I hope it is clear, so I'll I'll
proceed to the.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4571-0
00:28:18.331 --> 00:28:22.089
Uh, OK, Mr Rizwan wants to ask a
question, so I'm going to mute

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4571-1
00:28:22.089 --> 00:28:22.911
unmute people.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4577-0
00:28:31.941 --> 00:28:33.001
Mr This one, please speak.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4586-0
00:28:35.151 --> 00:28:35.351
Hi.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4590-0
00:28:35.361 --> 00:28:36.661
Thanks for meeting with her.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4630-0
00:28:36.671 --> 00:28:40.549
So my question is not related
to, you know the topic, but if

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4630-1
00:28:40.549 --> 00:28:44.491
you can see my message, I think
there was some issue with the

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4630-2
00:28:44.491 --> 00:28:46.271
one of the question of quiz.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4643-0
00:28:46.861 --> 00:28:47.671
Yeah, yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4633-0
00:28:47.441 --> 00:28:48.281
Leads questions.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4659-0
00:28:48.291 --> 00:28:52.376
OK, you you posted a quiz
question in the OK the following

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4659-1
00:28:52.376 --> 00:28:56.531
selected aggregation and got
zero marks MM seeing anything.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4662-0
00:28:55.191 --> 00:28:55.351
Yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4675-0
00:28:56.581 --> 00:28:59.174
So you're saying that you
selected aggregation for that

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4675-1
00:28:59.174 --> 00:29:00.471
question, but got zero must.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4686-0
00:29:00.541 --> 00:29:01.751
OK, then why don't you write?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4684-0
00:29:00.811 --> 00:29:01.771
Absolutely, yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4702-0
00:29:02.731 --> 00:29:06.841
Uh, OK, OK, so so let me let me
check that.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4732-0
00:29:07.191 --> 00:29:11.222
Mr Richman, I I don't want to
answer that question right away,

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4732-1
00:29:11.222 --> 00:29:15.445
but you, but it will be great if
you can send me a mail regarding

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4732-2
00:29:15.445 --> 00:29:16.021
the same.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4745-0
00:29:16.351 --> 00:29:19.011
So that will remind me to look
at it.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4746-0
00:29:19.841 --> 00:29:20.651
I'll do that, Sir.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4761-0
00:29:20.661 --> 00:29:24.091
I I'll send the email with the
proof that what I had selected.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4770-0
00:29:24.101 --> 00:29:24.441
Thank you.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4774-0
00:29:24.731 --> 00:29:26.871
Yeah, you can send the mail.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4795-0
00:29:26.971 --> 00:29:29.483
I I hope you know that my mail
ID it is there in the canvas

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4795-1
00:29:29.483 --> 00:29:30.321
page so you can see.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4797-0
00:29:31.291 --> 00:29:32.021
Sure, I'll check that.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4802-0
00:29:32.031 --> 00:29:32.541
Thank you so much.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4809-0
00:29:33.781 --> 00:29:36.821
Alright, so I'm muting people.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4812-0
00:29:35.721 --> 00:29:36.141
Ohh.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4813-0
00:29:37.021 --> 00:29:37.381
Yes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4821-0
00:29:37.391 --> 00:29:38.171
Any other question?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4829-0
00:29:39.051 --> 00:29:42.371
So for me it shows filling
missing values the correct

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4829-1
00:29:42.371 --> 00:29:42.801
answer.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4840-0
00:29:45.131 --> 00:29:47.181
It says missing values is the
correct answer.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4842-0
00:29:47.761 --> 00:29:47.961
Yes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4844-0
00:29:49.321 --> 00:29:49.831
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4851-0
00:29:50.481 --> 00:29:52.031
OK, I'll check that up also.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4860-0
00:29:52.091 --> 00:29:54.851
So it is showing the missing
values.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4864-0
00:29:55.371 --> 00:29:58.461
Missing values is also OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4878-0
00:30:00.691 --> 00:30:04.519
OK, missing values, filling the
missing value is not a

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4878-1
00:30:04.519 --> 00:30:05.841
transformation. OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4882-0
00:30:08.051 --> 00:30:10.651
Umm, OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4888-0
00:30:10.781 --> 00:30:11.791
OK, fine.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4890-0
00:30:11.861 --> 00:30:13.351
Aggregation.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4904-0
00:30:13.551 --> 00:30:20.701
Each aggregation can be if is OK
OK, let me see.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4912-0
00:30:20.711 --> 00:30:21.531
Let me see. OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4971-0
00:30:22.471 --> 00:30:26.624
The feeling that you or should
be the part of the data

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4971-1
00:30:26.624 --> 00:30:31.306
transformation, right, that is
the clear shot feeling missing

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4946-0
00:30:28.731 --> 00:30:31.471
Which one, Mr DINKAR?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4971-2
00:30:31.306 --> 00:30:35.988
value with the feeling missing
values that should be the part

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4966-0
00:30:33.311 --> 00:30:36.551
Missing value, yes. Mm-hmm.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4971-3
00:30:35.988 --> 00:30:39.311
of the data transformation for
sure, right?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4973-0
00:30:40.661 --> 00:30:41.131
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4975-0
00:30:41.141 --> 00:30:41.331
I'll.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4981-0
00:30:41.341 --> 00:30:41.971
I'll come back.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4996-0
00:30:41.981 --> 00:30:45.457
So if there is a problem with
that, so we'll, I'll see that,

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4996-1
00:30:45.457 --> 00:30:46.141
OK, alright.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/4999-0
00:30:47.411 --> 00:30:47.521
Yes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5010-0
00:30:48.131 --> 00:30:51.541
OK, I'll let me go back so find.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5021-0
00:30:51.631 --> 00:30:55.811
So if that is so, then maybe
I'll go to the next topic.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5031-0
00:30:57.621 --> 00:31:01.781
And which is the which is rule
based classification.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5046-0
00:31:09.421 --> 00:31:13.991
OK, so rule based classification
needs it's.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5063-0
00:31:14.001 --> 00:31:17.534
It's actually a cousin of
decision tree based methods, so

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5063-1
00:31:17.534 --> 00:31:20.701
this is also both of them are
highly interpretable.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5070-0
00:31:24.611 --> 00:31:27.551
Both of them are highly
interpretable.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5092-0
00:31:32.211 --> 00:31:35.102
Because they create a model
which a domain expert can easily

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5092-1
00:31:35.102 --> 00:31:36.951
see and say whether it is good
or bad.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5105-0
00:31:38.831 --> 00:31:41.641
Uh, these are these are pretty
tricky thing.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5142-0
00:31:41.651 --> 00:31:45.348
Domain expert can never validate
this and similarly this also is

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5142-1
00:31:45.348 --> 00:31:48.760
becomes difficult, though it
graphically may be able to see

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5142-2
00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:52.286
something in neural networks,
even the graphically there is a

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5142-3
00:31:52.286 --> 00:31:53.651
there is a little scope.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5148-0
00:31:55.181 --> 00:31:56.711
So, so now.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5158-0
00:31:56.751 --> 00:31:59.831
Now let's see how does a rule
based classifier work?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5183-0
00:32:00.991 --> 00:32:05.004
So a rule based classifier looks
like if then else rules that you

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5183-1
00:32:05.004 --> 00:32:07.071
see in the programming
languages.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5202-0
00:32:08.761 --> 00:32:11.101
So it is pretty much like the
rules that we have in

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5202-1
00:32:11.101 --> 00:32:12.091
programming languages.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5212-0
00:32:12.241 --> 00:32:17.431
So the rule will have something
like an antecedent.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5224-0
00:32:19.971 --> 00:32:22.631
So it is a LHS or antecedent.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5239-0
00:32:35.921 --> 00:32:39.331
Antecedent and then this is RHS.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5275-0
00:32:43.631 --> 00:32:48.138
Consequent, OK, so you can have
the rules of this phone, so we

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5275-1
00:32:48.138 --> 00:32:52.789
can create the rules saying that
this is this attribute is this,

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5275-2
00:32:52.789 --> 00:32:54.721
and this attribute is this.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5287-0
00:32:54.731 --> 00:32:58.671
And then this is the we can say
these are the class labels.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5301-0
00:33:06.191 --> 00:33:09.651
So now let us say this is the
training data we got.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5310-0
00:33:16.181 --> 00:33:18.121
And we can drop this attribute.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5327-0
00:33:26.701 --> 00:33:30.591
So now we have 4 attributes and
we have a class label.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5337-0
00:33:31.631 --> 00:33:36.031
So somehow, let's say somehow we
got this somehow we got.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5342-0
00:33:41.151 --> 00:33:42.061
Some set of rules.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5386-0
00:33:43.841 --> 00:33:48.723
So this looks like a highly
interpretable and useful model

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5386-1
00:33:48.723 --> 00:33:53.439
that we can create from a
training data, and the this is

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5386-2
00:33:53.439 --> 00:33:58.901
this is a rule based classifier,
so this is becoming a rule based

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5386-3
00:33:58.901 --> 00:33:59.811
classifier.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5407-0
00:34:00.461 --> 00:34:04.800
So now the question is that what
can we do once we have a rule

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5407-1
00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:05.971
based classifier?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5411-0
00:34:06.281 --> 00:34:07.741
So this is the test data.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5415-0
00:34:11.191 --> 00:34:11.751
That's stupid.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5428-0
00:34:14.161 --> 00:34:16.971
So we can check how it is
working.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5447-0
00:34:17.481 --> 00:34:24.108
So first tuple has got a give
birth is equal to no and can fly

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5447-1
00:34:24.108 --> 00:34:25.791
is equal to yes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5450-0
00:34:26.581 --> 00:34:27.901
So this should be.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5455-0
00:34:30.471 --> 00:34:31.661
Rule 1 should be.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5474-0
00:34:33.821 --> 00:34:37.429
Rule should be one should be
finding the class and the class

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5474-1
00:34:37.429 --> 00:34:38.671
label should be bird.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5476-0
00:34:39.641 --> 00:34:39.921
Great.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5480-0
00:34:41.141 --> 00:34:42.141
So.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5485-0
00:34:42.191 --> 00:34:44.051
So that seems to be good.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5495-0
00:34:44.891 --> 00:34:49.141
Now let's look at the next one.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5518-0
00:34:49.191 --> 00:34:54.403
The blood type is warm, so give
birth is equal to yes and can

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5518-1
00:34:54.403 --> 00:34:56.001
fly is equal to no.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5546-0
00:34:56.011 --> 00:35:00.114
So Rule 1 does not work live in
water is no so Rule 2 does not

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5546-1
00:35:00.114 --> 00:35:03.501
work, but give birth is yes and
black type is warm.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5567-0
00:35:03.551 --> 00:35:08.511
So it is a mammal, so we it is
triggered Rule 3 and we are

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5567-1
00:35:08.511 --> 00:35:10.781
classifying this as my mom.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5570-0
00:35:11.891 --> 00:35:13.351
So it worked well.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5573-0
00:35:19.441 --> 00:35:19.961
So far.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5593-0
00:35:25.131 --> 00:35:31.239
So, given a rule, given some
test data, so we want to see

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5593-1
00:35:31.239 --> 00:35:33.661
what makes a rule good.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5615-0
00:35:34.211 --> 00:35:38.940
So there are two parameters or
two metrics we can use to check

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5615-1
00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:40.441
whether the rule is.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5619-0
00:35:40.771 --> 00:35:41.841
How good is the rule?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5632-0
00:35:42.511 --> 00:35:47.361
So say status is single and
evade is no.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5640-0
00:35:47.571 --> 00:35:49.161
So this is what we are taking.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5650-0
00:35:49.551 --> 00:35:52.771
So we are looking at 1234.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5696-0
00:35:52.921 --> 00:35:58.685
So it is covering 4 out of 10
tuples so it be it has got a

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5696-1
00:35:58.685 --> 00:36:05.036
coverage of 40% and but then out
of these four tuples 2 have got

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5696-2
00:36:05.036 --> 00:36:07.381
no and two have got yes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5703-0
00:36:07.531 --> 00:36:10.371
So this is like 2 out of four.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5719-0
00:36:12.151 --> 00:36:14.641
So this is that goodness
accuracy is 50%.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5735-0
00:36:15.261 --> 00:36:22.483
So so we want to look at,
evaluate the rule based on both

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5735-1
00:36:22.483 --> 00:36:22.981
and.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5741-0
00:36:23.181 --> 00:36:25.941
So so now, now let us go.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5749-0
00:36:26.191 --> 00:36:27.451
Let us go little further.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5754-0
00:36:28.691 --> 00:36:29.881
Let us go little further.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5760-0
00:36:29.891 --> 00:36:31.551
So we got more test data.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5766-0
00:36:41.381 --> 00:36:42.401
So cool.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5782-0
00:36:43.011 --> 00:36:48.411
So lemur, the blood type is warm
and gives birth is yes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5786-0
00:36:48.461 --> 00:36:50.551
So Rule 3 is getting triggered.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5796-0
00:36:55.031 --> 00:36:57.491
And we classify this as moment.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5809-0
00:36:58.791 --> 00:37:01.981
So now let us look at the 4th
one.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5817-0
00:37:02.411 --> 00:37:05.491
The turtle that is the second
One South.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5841-0
00:37:05.501 --> 00:37:12.524
The blood type is cold and gives
birth is no and then can fly is

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5841-1
00:37:12.524 --> 00:37:15.981
no so rule one is not triggered.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5853-0
00:37:15.991 --> 00:37:19.771
Rule 2 is not triggered and the
turtle gives birth.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5867-0
00:37:19.781 --> 00:37:22.651
Is no Rule 3 is not triggered,
but Rule 4 is triggered.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5885-0
00:37:22.661 --> 00:37:28.831
Can fly is no and then live in
water sometimes, so it can be.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5888-0
00:37:29.341 --> 00:37:30.881
It can be a reptile.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5894-0
00:37:33.191 --> 00:37:34.391
Or can be an amphibian.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5924-0
00:37:37.451 --> 00:37:40.911
OK, let let us not get into the
biology because you can see that

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5924-1
00:37:40.911 --> 00:37:44.371
many reptiles or amphibians, so
that is why this cannot created.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5940-0
00:37:44.871 --> 00:37:50.204
But but then let us go with the
just like a just go with the

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5940-1
00:37:50.204 --> 00:37:50.641
data.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5953-0
00:37:50.651 --> 00:37:54.161
So let's say that it is
triggering 2 two rules.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5963-0
00:37:54.171 --> 00:37:57.151
That is, it is triggering Rule 4
and Rule 5.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5976-0
00:38:00.191 --> 00:38:03.521
OK, now let us look at the last
one.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5983-0
00:38:03.531 --> 00:38:06.101
Third one, the blood type is
cold.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5991-0
00:38:06.111 --> 00:38:07.561
It is not helping anyway.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/5998-0
00:38:07.651 --> 00:38:09.101
There is no rule with blood
type.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6016-0
00:38:09.111 --> 00:38:14.407
Cold gives birth is yes, but
blood type is warm so it doesn't

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6016-1
00:38:14.407 --> 00:38:15.091
work so.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6040-0
00:38:15.141 --> 00:38:19.070
So The thing is rule one rule
two, rule 3 rule ruled out Rule

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6040-1
00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:21.541
4 is ruled out because it gives
birth.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6061-0
00:38:21.551 --> 00:38:25.835
It's yes, and it lives in water,
so rule 5 is ruled out, so it

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6061-1
00:38:25.835 --> 00:38:27.671
triggers none of the rules.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6073-0
00:38:33.231 --> 00:38:34.251
So we got a problem.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6095-0
00:38:34.551 --> 00:38:39.001
Why not our five lives in a
water sometimes?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6107-0
00:38:37.381 --> 00:38:41.122
It's it lives in water all the
time, so it you cannot say that

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6107-1
00:38:41.122 --> 00:38:43.141
it lives in water only
sometimes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6106-0
00:38:41.371 --> 00:38:41.671
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6110-0
00:38:45.521 --> 00:38:45.781
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6143-0
00:38:47.311 --> 00:38:53.480
OK, so so now we have a problem
that is we there are some tuples

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6143-1
00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:58.415
for which the ambiguity is
coming because there are

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6143-2
00:38:58.415 --> 00:39:02.021
multiple rules are getting
triggered.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6153-0
00:39:02.031 --> 00:39:04.531
So we need to find out which is
the right rule.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6183-0
00:39:06.531 --> 00:39:11.522
And there are tuples for which
no rule is getting triggered, so

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6183-1
00:39:11.522 --> 00:39:16.357
we need to see whether we can
fix the classifier with respect

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6183-2
00:39:16.357 --> 00:39:17.761
to these problems.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6213-0
00:39:23.231 --> 00:39:26.580
Even the first rule is satisfied
is still, it will go further and

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6213-1
00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:29.321
it will check whether anything
else is also matching.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6224-0
00:39:29.331 --> 00:39:29.641
Right, Sir.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6241-0
00:39:29.841 --> 00:39:34.589
Ohh, now the question is yes, we
can always say that the moment

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6241-1
00:39:34.589 --> 00:39:37.111
First Rule is satisfied stop
the.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6244-0
00:39:37.121 --> 00:39:38.131
That is possible.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6255-0
00:39:38.141 --> 00:39:41.011
That can be that is part of the
solution, not the problem.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6261-0
00:39:41.461 --> 00:39:42.391
Yes, we can say that.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6313-0
00:39:43.451 --> 00:39:47.089
So in that case we need to have
a mechanism to say that some of

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6278-0
00:39:44.201 --> 00:39:44.421
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6313-1
00:39:47.089 --> 00:39:50.670
the rules are more important and
then somebody should come and

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6313-2
00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:54.023
say that some rules are more
important and put them at the

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6313-3
00:39:54.023 --> 00:39:56.581
top and some rules have a lesser
importance.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6326-0
00:39:56.591 --> 00:39:58.661
So put them at the bottom, so
that should be.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6331-0
00:39:58.671 --> 00:40:00.081
That is one possible approach.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6355-0
00:40:00.491 --> 00:40:03.782
So yes, so we are going to see
what are the, what are the ways

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6350-0
00:40:02.561 --> 00:40:02.741
So.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6355-1
00:40:03.782 --> 00:40:05.611
in which we are going to fix
this.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6370-0
00:40:13.561 --> 00:40:18.806
So we would like the rule based
classifier to be mutually

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6370-1
00:40:18.806 --> 00:40:19.711
exclusive.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6398-0
00:40:19.781 --> 00:40:24.656
You should create the rules
which are mutually exclusive, so

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6398-1
00:40:24.656 --> 00:40:28.891
that is every record is covered
by at most one rule.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6406-0
00:40:29.441 --> 00:40:31.651
At most one rule, not more than
that.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6427-0
00:40:33.011 --> 00:40:37.640
OK, the rules are independent of
each other and then ray record

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6427-1
00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:39.521
triggers no more than one.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6437-0
00:40:40.111 --> 00:40:44.531
So that is 11 desirable feature
that we would like.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6456-0
00:40:44.541 --> 00:40:49.862
So it avoids the problem that we
had and we also want it to be

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6456-1
00:40:49.862 --> 00:40:50.791
exhausting.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6474-0
00:40:51.361 --> 00:40:56.298
So that is, if we take counts
for every possible combination

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6474-1
00:40:56.298 --> 00:40:57.431
of attributes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6487-0
00:40:57.481 --> 00:41:01.281
So in fact, so that is the
record should trigger at least

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6487-1
00:41:01.281 --> 00:41:01.871
one rule.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6495-0
00:41:03.581 --> 00:41:07.111
So we want we want we want.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6505-0
00:41:11.001 --> 00:41:14.191
Just to pull two trigger.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6509-0
00:41:17.741 --> 00:41:19.051
Exactly one rule.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6521-0
00:41:20.921 --> 00:41:23.291
So that is the that is in fact
our aim.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6525-0
00:41:23.861 --> 00:41:24.611
So.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6550-0
00:41:24.661 --> 00:41:29.513
So the point is, we may or may
not be able to reach that point,

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6550-1
00:41:29.513 --> 00:41:32.091
because if we reach there, it
is.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6602-0
00:41:32.361 --> 00:41:37.226
It is possible that we may end
up with very large predicates

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6602-1
00:41:37.226 --> 00:41:42.012
because test data may have 20,
so training data may have 20

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6602-2
00:41:42.012 --> 00:41:47.037
attributes, but we may thought
we may have found a way whereby

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6602-3
00:41:47.037 --> 00:41:51.983
simple rule is about to is doing
a discrimination between the

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6602-4
00:41:51.983 --> 00:41:52.621
classes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6613-0
00:41:53.091 --> 00:41:56.901
But then if we demand that
exactly one rule.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6656-0
00:41:57.291 --> 00:42:01.471
So in that case, in that case,
we may end up with the very big

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6656-1
00:42:01.471 --> 00:42:05.519
predicates in order to on the
left side, the antecedent will

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6656-2
00:42:05.519 --> 00:42:09.833
become very big, so the so more
like we may want to relax one of

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6656-3
00:42:09.833 --> 00:42:10.231
these.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6678-0
00:42:11.111 --> 00:42:14.677
But but then we are looking at
the concerns that we have seen

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6678-1
00:42:14.677 --> 00:42:16.921
with the classifier that we have
seen.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6687-0
00:42:17.551 --> 00:42:20.881
So now let us look at Decision
Tree.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6701-0
00:42:21.291 --> 00:42:22.581
So we constructed.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6706-0
00:42:22.171 --> 00:42:26.311
Sir, I just want to do so by
predicates.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6712-0
00:42:26.321 --> 00:42:28.271
What exactly you mean, Sir?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6740-0
00:42:28.321 --> 00:42:30.591
Like the combination that you
have.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6721-0
00:42:29.351 --> 00:42:29.691
Ohh.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6725-0
00:42:29.701 --> 00:42:30.241
OK, OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6729-0
00:42:30.251 --> 00:42:30.521
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6732-0
00:42:30.531 --> 00:42:30.861
You are.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6744-0
00:42:30.871 --> 00:42:33.201
You're saying, what is the
meaning of the word predicate?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6747-0
00:42:33.211 --> 00:42:33.721
OK, OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6756-0
00:42:33.731 --> 00:42:34.421
So it is.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6774-0
00:42:34.431 --> 00:42:39.123
It is essentially things like
uh, things like condition, which

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6773-0
00:42:34.651 --> 00:42:34.871
Yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6774-1
00:42:39.123 --> 00:42:42.921
becomes true or false because
for example this is.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6784-0
00:42:46.341 --> 00:42:47.611
Refund is equal to no.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6792-0
00:42:47.881 --> 00:42:50.211
I can say that this is 1
predicate, right?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6820-0
00:42:50.501 --> 00:42:53.651
So this is becoming this can
have a value of true or false.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6807-0
00:42:51.231 --> 00:42:51.861
OK, OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6828-0
00:42:54.831 --> 00:42:55.591
Right, right, right.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6832-0
00:42:54.951 --> 00:42:56.581
Uh, so I had one.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6848-0
00:42:55.001 --> 00:42:58.866
So, so essentially all the
elements that are constituting

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6848-1
00:42:58.866 --> 00:43:02.731
the rule on the left side which
are separated by the end.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6876-0
00:43:02.781 --> 00:43:05.723
So we are calling them each one
as we can call that as a

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6876-1
00:43:05.723 --> 00:43:06.601
predicate, right?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6883-0
00:43:06.761 --> 00:43:08.771
Uh, I had one question on the
last slide.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6879-0
00:43:07.221 --> 00:43:07.881
OK, got it.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6894-0
00:43:09.841 --> 00:43:11.501
Yes, previous slide, right, yes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6889-0
00:43:11.631 --> 00:43:12.101
Yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6925-0
00:43:12.171 --> 00:43:15.120
So, uh, if we go, if we go by
these two rules that they are

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6925-1
00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:16.841
mutually exclusive and
exhaustive.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6923-0
00:43:16.131 --> 00:43:17.601
You know that these are not the
rules.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6935-0
00:43:17.611 --> 00:43:20.381
Essentially, these are something
which are more desirable.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6943-0
00:43:20.391 --> 00:43:21.401
That is what we are seeing.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6984-0
00:43:21.451 --> 00:43:24.708
These are not really rules, so
we are saying that if these

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6964-0
00:43:22.241 --> 00:43:25.021
OK, so so the the last.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6984-1
00:43:24.708 --> 00:43:28.076
characteristics are there then
what we are saying is that we

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6974-0
00:43:27.121 --> 00:43:27.281
And.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6984-2
00:43:28.076 --> 00:43:30.781
the problem that we had would
not have occurred.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6991-0
00:43:31.101 --> 00:43:31.631
Yeah, go ahead.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6994-0
00:43:32.431 --> 00:43:33.061
OK, OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/6997-0
00:43:33.101 --> 00:43:33.421
So.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7041-0
00:43:33.431 --> 00:43:36.726
So the in the previous slide the
turtle example, so it was a

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7008-0
00:43:33.531 --> 00:43:34.371
So best.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7041-1
00:43:36.726 --> 00:43:40.020
hitting two of the roles, so
it's OK that it was hitting two

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7041-2
00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:42.991
of the rules, but it's desirable
that it hit only one.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7047-0
00:43:44.351 --> 00:43:45.741
Yes, that is because.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7077-0
00:43:45.751 --> 00:43:48.650
See The thing is, unless
somebody is coming to you and

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7077-1
00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:51.866
telling that one rule is more
important than the other, then

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7077-2
00:43:51.866 --> 00:43:54.291
you don't know how to classify
turtle, right?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7078-0
00:43:55.371 --> 00:43:55.681
Umm.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7096-0
00:43:57.951 --> 00:43:59.331
So that is, that is what it is.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7110-0
00:43:58.241 --> 00:44:02.706
So based on based on these two
characteristics, that means our

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7110-1
00:44:02.706 --> 00:44:05.541
rules were like we need to
refine them.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7124-0
00:44:05.551 --> 00:44:06.441
They are not complete.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7116-0
00:44:07.331 --> 00:44:07.681
Yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7122-0
00:44:07.691 --> 00:44:08.121
Yeah, right.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7142-0
00:44:08.131 --> 00:44:11.333
That is right, that is in fact
what we want to say, that the

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7142-1
00:44:11.333 --> 00:44:12.541
rules have not reached.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7158-0
00:44:13.151 --> 00:44:16.730
We we want to refine the rules
or we want to refine the entire

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7158-1
00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:17.241
rule set.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7185-0
00:44:17.251 --> 00:44:21.083
We are going to see what we need
to do so that the so that it

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7185-1
00:44:21.083 --> 00:44:25.101
works like a classifier which is
giving us a single class label.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7198-0
00:44:25.111 --> 00:44:27.591
So we are going to find ways to
do that, yes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7199-0
00:44:28.801 --> 00:44:29.211
Except.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7215-0
00:44:35.571 --> 00:44:37.831
OK. Yes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7222-0
00:44:35.691 --> 00:44:39.594
So what more question when we
are setting this rule example a

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7222-1
00:44:39.594 --> 00:44:40.601
refund is there?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7231-0
00:44:41.471 --> 00:44:41.611
Yes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7271-0
00:44:41.561 --> 00:44:46.312
Can we combine 2 rules together
and to find an example a squal

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7271-1
00:44:46.312 --> 00:44:51.215
to zero and B is equal to 1 and
then we're giving you a glass to

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7259-0
00:44:48.751 --> 00:44:49.081
Umm.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7271-2
00:44:51.215 --> 00:44:51.441
me?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7275-0
00:44:51.221 --> 00:44:53.631
Yes, that is, that is what we
were doing here, right?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7297-0
00:44:53.761 --> 00:44:57.278
We were doing, we are combining
multiple attributes so that is

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7297-1
00:44:57.278 --> 00:45:00.181
that anyway, yes, we we will
have to do right, yes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7298-0
00:45:00.501 --> 00:45:00.661
Sure.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7309-0
00:45:02.801 --> 00:45:05.391
OK, so now let us let us see.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7319-0
00:45:05.841 --> 00:45:08.191
Let us say we have this decision
tree.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7329-0
00:45:08.201 --> 00:45:09.931
We know how to build this
decision tree.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7345-0
00:45:09.941 --> 00:45:13.348
We have used it using a
heuristic, either Gini or

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7345-1
00:45:13.348 --> 00:45:14.711
entropy or whatever.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7348-0
00:45:14.721 --> 00:45:15.551
So we build that.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7363-0
00:45:16.161 --> 00:45:20.778
So now our next question is that
can we derive the rules from

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7363-1
00:45:20.778 --> 00:45:21.151
here?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7380-0
00:45:21.161 --> 00:45:24.773
Yes, we can do that right from
Decision Tree to rules is very

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7380-1
00:45:24.773 --> 00:45:25.181
simple.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7400-0
00:45:25.881 --> 00:45:29.959
So all we need to do is that we
have to take each branch or or

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7400-1
00:45:29.959 --> 00:45:30.671
we have to.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7410-0
00:45:30.781 --> 00:45:33.771
We have to find the path to
reach each leaf.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7418-0
00:45:34.201 --> 00:45:36.381
So essentially we have to trace
the path.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7427-0
00:45:42.641 --> 00:45:43.361
Do each leaf.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7441-0
00:45:45.941 --> 00:45:49.361
We have 4 leaves here so we got
4 rules.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7468-0
00:45:50.021 --> 00:45:54.569
So refund is equal to yes is no
then refund is equal to no and

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7468-1
00:45:54.569 --> 00:45:56.591
then this is marital status.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7476-0
00:45:56.601 --> 00:45:59.251
Single diverse taxable income
less than 80K?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7478-0
00:45:59.261 --> 00:45:59.651
No.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7487-0
00:45:59.811 --> 00:46:01.531
So we got all the rules.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7504-0
00:46:01.541 --> 00:46:09.461
That is essentially this is
representing 1234 right 1234.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7513-0
00:46:10.221 --> 00:46:13.091
4 rules to represent the four
leaf nodes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7526-0
00:46:16.041 --> 00:46:18.361
And what are the advantages that
we are getting?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7534-0
00:46:19.351 --> 00:46:22.611
This is that the rules are
mutually exclusive.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7540-0
00:46:24.581 --> 00:46:25.991
And rules or exhausted.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7580-0
00:46:30.761 --> 00:46:34.084
But exhaustive to the extent
that we consider those

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7580-1
00:46:34.084 --> 00:46:38.173
attributes in the decision tree
because we had three attributes

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7580-2
00:46:38.173 --> 00:46:41.687
in the toy data set and we
considered them in addition

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7580-3
00:46:41.687 --> 00:46:42.071
three.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7644-0
00:46:42.201 --> 00:46:45.481
But then when we have a larger
data sets with far more

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7644-1
00:46:45.481 --> 00:46:48.642
attributes, we may drop some of
the attributes while

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7644-2
00:46:48.642 --> 00:46:52.279
constructing the tree may not
use them because we think that

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7644-3
00:46:52.279 --> 00:46:55.858
they're not improving either
Gini or entropy or any any way

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7644-4
00:46:55.858 --> 00:46:58.601
they are going to improve the
quality of the.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7660-0
00:46:59.431 --> 00:47:04.075
So in such cases such cases, the
question of exhaustive becomes a

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7660-1
00:47:04.075 --> 00:47:05.201
difficult thing.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7666-0
00:47:05.251 --> 00:47:07.421
Actually, exhaustive is treated
like this.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7679-0
00:47:07.871 --> 00:47:12.131
So you have, let us say, let us
say, training data.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7702-0
00:47:15.641 --> 00:47:22.866
So training data uh is having a
of some tuples, some some

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7702-1
00:47:22.866 --> 00:47:27.351
attributes had some attributes
and.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7710-0
00:47:31.291 --> 00:47:34.791
Attributes and test day test
tuple.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7716-0
00:47:36.851 --> 00:47:38.951
Had all those attributes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7738-0
00:47:43.171 --> 00:47:48.036
So then for creating exhaustive
rules, what you need is only on

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7738-1
00:47:48.036 --> 00:47:50.621
one of the attributes, the
rules.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7753-0
00:47:50.631 --> 00:47:54.041
All the conditions should be
considered so that is sufficient

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7753-1
00:47:54.041 --> 00:47:55.691
to create exhaustive rule set.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7757-0
00:47:56.181 --> 00:47:56.901
Is that clear?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7763-0
00:47:56.971 --> 00:47:59.281
So for example, so here.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7771-0
00:47:59.871 --> 00:48:03.591
Here, suppose that we have rules
saying that.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7774-0
00:48:05.381 --> 00:48:06.161
Give both.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7784-0
00:48:10.181 --> 00:48:13.271
Is equal to yes, implies mammal.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7793-0
00:48:15.201 --> 00:48:17.871
And give both is equal to noon.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7800-0
00:48:21.111 --> 00:48:22.021
Implies.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7811-0
00:48:22.311 --> 00:48:25.401
Let us say give birth is new
implies.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7815-0
00:48:25.871 --> 00:48:26.281
Let's see.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7822-0
00:48:27.311 --> 00:48:29.611
Ohh bird right bird.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7842-0
00:48:31.741 --> 00:48:35.791
So this is this is in a in the
sense of the rule based

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7842-1
00:48:35.791 --> 00:48:36.601
classifier.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7869-0
00:48:36.611 --> 00:48:40.066
This is exhausting because any
test tuple that comes that will

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7869-1
00:48:40.066 --> 00:48:43.522
have either give birth is equal
to yes, or give birth is equal

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7869-2
00:48:43.522 --> 00:48:43.851
to no.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7896-0
00:48:44.241 --> 00:48:47.755
So what that means is that the
moment that attribute is given,

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7896-1
00:48:47.755 --> 00:48:50.934
we can determine what is the
class, because it is either

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7896-2
00:48:50.934 --> 00:48:51.771
mammal or bird.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7916-0
00:48:52.001 --> 00:48:55.566
So in that sense, we are never
going to say no, we are always

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7916-1
00:48:55.566 --> 00:48:56.831
getting a class label.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7927-0
00:48:57.181 --> 00:48:59.971
So so it is never going to
happen.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7955-0
00:49:00.041 --> 00:49:04.461
For example, in this case he
could not give a class for the

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/7955-1
00:49:04.461 --> 00:49:08.661
dog shark because for give birth
is equal to yes and no.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8001-0
00:49:08.671 --> 00:49:13.773
Both of them are not covered
because give birth no is covered

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8001-1
00:49:13.773 --> 00:49:18.875
with some other attributes and
so so so the point is that you

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8001-2
00:49:18.875 --> 00:49:23.648
are not able to get for one
single attribute clarity even

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8001-3
00:49:23.648 --> 00:49:25.541
when you are giving it.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8011-0
00:49:25.551 --> 00:49:27.471
For example, give birth is equal
to no.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8031-0
00:49:27.481 --> 00:49:30.975
You have can fly is equal to
yes, but can fly is equal to no

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8031-1
00:49:30.975 --> 00:49:31.891
it is not there.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8047-0
00:49:32.941 --> 00:49:36.271
So, OK, give birth is equal to
new can fly is equal to no.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8050-0
00:49:36.311 --> 00:49:36.951
OK, fine.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8064-0
00:49:37.061 --> 00:49:40.271
So but give birth is black type
one is there but give birth.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8070-0
00:49:40.281 --> 00:49:40.511
Yes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8084-0
00:49:40.521 --> 00:49:43.254
And black type hold is given,
then it would have become

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8084-1
00:49:43.254 --> 00:49:43.791
exhaustive.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8087-0
00:49:44.341 --> 00:49:44.881
Is that clear?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8118-0
00:49:46.331 --> 00:49:49.745
So you don't need really that if
there are 100 attributes, you

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8118-1
00:49:49.745 --> 00:49:52.401
don't need to cover 2 to the
power of 100 rules.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8114-0
00:49:50.061 --> 00:49:50.561
Can you repeat?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8160-0
00:49:52.691 --> 00:49:55.998
So all you need to make sure
that at least few attributes for

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8160-1
00:49:55.998 --> 00:49:59.358
which we are we are going to get
the values in the test tuples

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8160-2
00:49:59.358 --> 00:50:01.331
they have been exhaustively
covered.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8203-0
00:50:02.761 --> 00:50:05.822
So then then it is never going
to say no, it is going to give

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8178-0
00:50:02.801 --> 00:50:04.751
So Sir said.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8203-1
00:50:05.822 --> 00:50:08.933
the answer whether the quality
of the answer we will see there

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8203-2
00:50:08.933 --> 00:50:11.451
is a still the problem, but then
it is exhaustive.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8210-0
00:50:11.521 --> 00:50:13.171
Yes, yes, someone has a
question.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8219-0
00:50:13.031 --> 00:50:14.351
So, yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8217-0
00:50:13.181 --> 00:50:13.601
Please go ahead.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8223-0
00:50:14.411 --> 00:50:15.251
Yeah, Sir.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8241-0
00:50:15.431 --> 00:50:19.500
So it means that whatever rule
we are making, those are

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8241-1
00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:20.881
mutually exclusive.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8263-0
00:50:21.161 --> 00:50:27.327
I mean to say that suppose for
one tuple a, can we have two

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8263-1
00:50:27.327 --> 00:50:28.971
rules satisfied?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8268-0
00:50:31.581 --> 00:50:32.171
No, no.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8277-0
00:50:32.181 --> 00:50:34.351
See that they're mutually
exclusive.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8283-0
00:50:34.361 --> 00:50:35.431
We have not even talked about.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8340-0
00:50:35.441 --> 00:50:39.199
We only talked about exhausting,
so mutually exclusive, saying

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8340-1
00:50:39.199 --> 00:50:43.017
that they have to be completely
independent and that is not the

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8340-2
00:50:43.017 --> 00:50:46.835
case with the R4 and R5 because
they're talking about different

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8340-3
00:50:46.835 --> 00:50:50.474
attributes, but those attributes
may exist for some new test

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8340-4
00:50:50.474 --> 00:50:52.801
tuple or all the attributes may
exist.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8354-0
00:50:53.661 --> 00:50:55.991
So Miss Surbhi, are we In Sync?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8362-0
00:50:56.441 --> 00:50:59.621
Because, OK, so that is
different.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8364-0
00:50:56.461 --> 00:50:58.071
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8373-0
00:50:59.631 --> 00:51:01.421
We are only talking about
exhaustive.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8402-0
00:51:01.821 --> 00:51:05.838
The exhaustive is it is not
necessary that if you got 100

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8402-1
00:51:05.838 --> 00:51:10.340
attribute training data you need
to create really 2 to the power

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8402-2
00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:11.241
of 100 rules.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8425-0
00:51:11.631 --> 00:51:16.522
So all you need to do is that
you need to create only the

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8425-1
00:51:16.522 --> 00:51:19.221
rules on at least one attribute.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8451-0
00:51:19.711 --> 00:51:22.142
All the possible combinations
you should be able to get

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8451-1
00:51:22.142 --> 00:51:24.659
because if the test tuple is
having that attribute we are

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8451-2
00:51:24.659 --> 00:51:25.701
going to get the result.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8455-0
00:51:30.701 --> 00:51:31.331
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8464-0
00:51:31.501 --> 00:51:34.881
So OK, then we will proceed
further.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8460-0
00:51:31.881 --> 00:51:32.091
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8480-0
00:51:35.941 --> 00:51:40.701
So what we are saying is that we
are looking at this.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8508-0
00:51:42.121 --> 00:51:45.511
So we are seeing that in case of
a decision tree because the

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8508-1
00:51:45.511 --> 00:51:49.179
decision tree whatever attribute
is there, we are considering all

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8508-2
00:51:49.179 --> 00:51:50.291
the possible values.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8586-0
00:51:50.301 --> 00:51:53.817
For example, refund is equal to
yes no both of them are

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8586-1
00:51:53.817 --> 00:51:57.898
considered fully and so So what
that means is that when we get a

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8586-2
00:51:57.898 --> 00:52:01.853
new tuple so it has to be the
refund is equal to yes or refund

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8586-3
00:52:01.853 --> 00:52:05.683
is equal to no and one of the
marital status should exist so

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8586-4
00:52:05.683 --> 00:52:09.262
so the point is that if those
attributes are given so we

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8586-5
00:52:09.262 --> 00:52:11.271
should be able to get the class.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8598-0
00:52:12.221 --> 00:52:15.411
Now let us see the rules given
me.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8625-0
00:52:15.421 --> 00:52:18.828
The decision trees sometimes
tend to be longer because the

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8625-1
00:52:18.828 --> 00:52:22.581
decision trees sometimes may go
for depth of 45610 and all that.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8642-0
00:52:23.591 --> 00:52:27.264
So so suppose that we may want
to simplify the rules so that

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8642-1
00:52:27.264 --> 00:52:29.131
they become more interpretable.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8669-0
00:52:30.201 --> 00:52:35.141
So now let us say this is the
initial rule, OK refund is equal

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8669-1
00:52:35.141 --> 00:52:38.121
to no end status is equal to
married.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8673-0
00:52:38.191 --> 00:52:38.981
It is no.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8704-0
00:52:39.431 --> 00:52:44.401
But now let us say we got
another rule that is saying the

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8704-1
00:52:44.401 --> 00:52:49.971
refund is equal to yes in place
status is the class label is no.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8738-0
00:52:50.801 --> 00:52:59.436
So now from this now let me call
this Rule X and this as rule Yi

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8738-1
00:52:59.436 --> 00:53:06.211
can combine rule X and rule Y
and create rule jet.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8743-0
00:53:08.191 --> 00:53:08.641
Right.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8751-0
00:53:08.981 --> 00:53:11.041
You can see this doesn't matter.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8814-0
00:53:11.051 --> 00:53:14.478
Whatever is the refund, whether
refund is equal to yes and

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8814-1
00:53:14.478 --> 00:53:17.904
status is equal to married
because when refund is equal to

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8814-2
00:53:17.904 --> 00:53:21.447
yes, it implies no means that
refund is equal to yes even if

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8814-3
00:53:21.447 --> 00:53:25.223
the status is married then it is
still no right so now refund is

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8814-4
00:53:25.223 --> 00:53:28.301
equal to no and then status is
married then also no.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8835-0
00:53:28.311 --> 00:53:32.001
So when status is married,
whether refund is equal to yes

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8835-1
00:53:32.001 --> 00:53:33.401
or no, it is still no.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8860-0
00:53:33.811 --> 00:53:37.581
So that means we can create a
simplified rule which is rule

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8860-1
00:53:37.581 --> 00:53:41.477
checked which is status is equal
to married implies the class

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8860-2
00:53:41.477 --> 00:53:42.231
label is no.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8876-0
00:53:44.611 --> 00:53:51.045
So once we start simplifying the
rules, we may not get mutually

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8876-1
00:53:51.045 --> 00:53:52.051
exclusive.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8903-0
00:53:52.181 --> 00:53:56.274
And then exhaustive rules,
because once we simplify them

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8903-1
00:53:56.274 --> 00:54:00.798
much further, then we may end up
with the rules which will get

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8903-2
00:54:00.798 --> 00:54:02.091
into the problems.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8936-0
00:54:02.461 --> 00:54:07.251
So so two ways in which we can
solve them is that if the rules

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8936-1
00:54:07.251 --> 00:54:11.966
are not mutually exclusive as
one of you have already pointed

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8936-2
00:54:11.966 --> 00:54:14.171
out, why not order the rules?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8942-0
00:54:16.161 --> 00:54:17.501
OK, order the rules.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8960-0
00:54:17.941 --> 00:54:21.546
So somebody has to say which
rule is more important than the

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8960-1
00:54:21.546 --> 00:54:21.901
other.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8996-0
00:54:23.721 --> 00:54:30.117
So that way First Rule is going
to be first Rule is going to be

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8996-1
00:54:30.117 --> 00:54:36.512
a is going to be accepted or we
can keep all the rules and then

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/8996-2
00:54:36.512 --> 00:54:38.411
we can see whether.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9017-0
00:54:38.481 --> 00:54:44.577
So suppose that there are C1 and
C2 are the two classes and it

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9017-1
00:54:44.577 --> 00:54:45.641
test tuple.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9020-0
00:54:49.041 --> 00:54:49.651
Triggers.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9023-0
00:54:51.711 --> 00:54:52.391
Fire rules.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9044-0
00:54:54.581 --> 00:54:58.565
And C1 is triggered by two rules
and C2 is triggered by three

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9044-1
00:54:58.565 --> 00:54:58.951
rules.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9058-0
00:54:59.361 --> 00:55:03.281
Then we can use it as a voting
scheme and say that test tuple.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9079-0
00:55:06.171 --> 00:55:11.532
Belongs to C2 because more rules
of C2 are getting triggered than

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9079-1
00:55:11.532 --> 00:55:12.101
the C1.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9085-0
00:55:12.971 --> 00:55:14.841
So that is one approach.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9096-0
00:55:15.351 --> 00:55:18.101
And then and the other one
other.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9108-0
00:55:18.111 --> 00:55:21.011
This is solving the problem of
mutually exclusive.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9132-0
00:55:21.741 --> 00:55:24.988
But when the rules are not
mutually exclusive, say rules

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9132-1
00:55:24.988 --> 00:55:28.634
are not exhaustive, then what we
can have is that we can simply

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9132-2
00:55:28.634 --> 00:55:29.831
have a default class.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9150-0
00:55:32.471 --> 00:55:35.914
So thereby if no rules
triggered, we are going to call

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9150-1
00:55:35.914 --> 00:55:36.791
it by sending.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9171-0
00:55:44.001 --> 00:55:49.548
So now let us say we have
prioritized the rules and there

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9171-1
00:55:49.548 --> 00:55:52.131
is a ranking for the rules.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9184-0
00:55:52.621 --> 00:55:56.961
So now the rules are so then
what is going to happen?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9192-0
00:55:57.891 --> 00:56:01.431
So Turtle will become it
riptide.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9198-0
00:56:05.761 --> 00:56:07.541
Because this is the ranking.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9213-0
00:56:22.021 --> 00:56:25.091
So they ranking is in along this
line.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9223-0
00:56:25.141 --> 00:56:30.391
So we will say this is this is
becoming a reptile.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9246-0
00:56:36.321 --> 00:56:40.664
OK, so when we are creating the
ranking or ordering for the

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9246-1
00:56:40.664 --> 00:56:42.981
rules, we can take 2 approaches.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9272-0
00:56:43.921 --> 00:56:49.021
One needs one needs a rule based
ordering, so we can see that

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9272-1
00:56:49.021 --> 00:56:52.641
some rule is more important than
the other.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9304-0
00:56:52.651 --> 00:56:58.292
So we are saying that this is R1
not two or three or four, so

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9304-1
00:56:58.292 --> 00:57:03.661
that can be one approach or we
can do a class based order.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9319-0
00:57:04.031 --> 00:57:08.800
So the class based ordering is
more often helpful when we are

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9319-1
00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:10.261
trying to diagnose.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9323-0
00:57:14.271 --> 00:57:15.881
He critical.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9327-0
00:57:20.431 --> 00:57:21.001
Epidemic.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9370-0
00:57:23.071 --> 00:57:26.852
So in that case, what we are
saying is that first we want to,

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9370-1
00:57:26.852 --> 00:57:30.329
if we have a smallest suspicion
about a person, so we'll

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9370-2
00:57:30.329 --> 00:57:34.171
straight away, put that person
in the quarantine for one week.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9383-0
00:57:35.051 --> 00:57:37.761
So that is that is the way we
are going to.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9402-0
00:57:37.811 --> 00:57:40.497
So we are not going to
complicate further saying that

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9402-1
00:57:40.497 --> 00:57:43.581
because the importance is that
the disease should not spread.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9424-0
00:57:44.421 --> 00:57:49.127
So any suspicion you have about
the epidemic with certain person

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9424-1
00:57:49.127 --> 00:57:53.471
so immediately you start putting
that person in quarantine.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9445-0
00:57:53.481 --> 00:57:57.891
So this is this is an example of
a class based order rule based

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9445-1
00:57:57.891 --> 00:57:58.511
ordering.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9455-0
00:57:58.521 --> 00:58:00.801
You can start doing in many
commercial situations.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9473-0
00:58:00.811 --> 00:58:03.754
So for example, there is always
a consideration whether this

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9473-1
00:58:03.754 --> 00:58:05.491
person will buy the product or
not.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9500-0
00:58:06.101 --> 00:58:09.689
So you can start considering all
possible reasons, because there

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9500-1
00:58:09.689 --> 00:58:13.111
is nothing critical either, so
it's nothing life threatening.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9528-0
00:58:13.121 --> 00:58:16.390
So you can always think in terms
of if you think some rule has a

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9528-1
00:58:16.390 --> 00:58:19.609
higher quality irrespective of
the class you want to trigger it

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9528-2
00:58:19.609 --> 00:58:19.911
first.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9571-0
00:58:24.761 --> 00:58:29.786
OK, so now now I hope the idea
of the rules and idea of

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9544-0
00:58:25.211 --> 00:58:27.571
But sorry the one.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9571-1
00:58:29.786 --> 00:58:35.618
resolving the order of the rules
and then looking at the quality

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9571-2
00:58:35.618 --> 00:58:37.951
of the rules is all clear.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9589-0
00:58:38.461 --> 00:58:41.991
So we will look at some more
metrics related to the rules.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9605-0
00:58:42.461 --> 00:58:46.891
So before that we can take if
there are questions I'll take.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9593-0
00:58:42.611 --> 00:58:43.101
Search the.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9624-0
00:58:46.901 --> 00:58:48.821
Otherwise, we can take 5 minute
break, right?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9619-0
00:58:48.361 --> 00:58:49.491
Say I have one note.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9634-0
00:58:49.561 --> 00:58:50.811
So can you please go to the
preview?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9643-0
00:58:50.201 --> 00:58:53.831
Yes, yes, there go to the
previous slide, right.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9656-0
00:58:54.071 --> 00:58:58.461
In that reptile or that MBA in
this example, is there right?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9661-0
00:58:58.301 --> 00:58:59.091
OK, OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9673-0
00:58:58.471 --> 00:58:59.521
Put them inside.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9680-0
00:58:59.101 --> 00:59:01.821
So you want me to go to the this
slide, this one?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9677-0
00:59:02.681 --> 00:59:03.231
Yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9709-0
00:59:03.301 --> 00:59:09.405
So here how we do with the both
the R4 and R5 rules apply over

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9703-0
00:59:03.921 --> 00:59:04.151
Yes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9709-1
00:59:09.405 --> 00:59:10.471
here right?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9722-0
00:59:11.281 --> 00:59:14.478
No, no, because we are saying
Rule 4 is more important than

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9722-1
00:59:14.478 --> 00:59:14.851
Rule 5.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9726-0
00:59:15.041 --> 00:59:15.861
That is what now?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9737-0
00:59:16.351 --> 00:59:18.491
So this is one way of resolving
it.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9817-0
00:59:18.621 --> 00:59:22.829
I'm not saying that biology,
that is the way they do it, but

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9817-1
00:59:22.829 --> 00:59:27.244
then, yes, suppose that in some
problem that you have in domain

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9753-0
00:59:22.951 --> 00:59:23.261
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9817-2
00:59:27.244 --> 00:59:31.591
a ranking is there and then you
take it and in any case I have

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9817-3
00:59:31.591 --> 00:59:35.730
already given you the example
where if you are diagnosing a

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9786-0
00:59:32.931 --> 00:59:33.211
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9817-4
00:59:35.730 --> 00:59:40.076
critical epidemic, so you are
always going to give some higher

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9817-5
00:59:40.076 --> 00:59:43.181
priority to one class over the
other, right?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9820-0
00:59:44.321 --> 00:59:44.541
Yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9826-0
00:59:45.591 --> 00:59:46.301
Yes, yes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9828-0
00:59:46.411 --> 00:59:46.631
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9834-0
00:59:47.111 --> 00:59:47.541
Is it clear?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9832-0
00:59:47.531 --> 00:59:48.101
Yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9845-0
00:59:48.251 --> 00:59:48.951
Yes, yes, yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9840-0
00:59:49.471 --> 00:59:50.081
OK, OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9881-0
00:59:49.731 --> 00:59:53.491
But Sir, here, here I am not
getting one thing between the

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9851-0
00:59:50.091 --> 00:59:50.621
So we.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9881-1
00:59:53.491 --> 00:59:57.505
difference between rule based
and class based that what we are

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9875-0
00:59:57.111 --> 00:59:57.571
OK, OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9881-2
00:59:57.505 --> 00:59:59.481
doing extra in the class based.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9885-0
01:00:00.771 --> 01:00:01.541
No, no, no, no.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9913-0
01:00:01.551 --> 01:00:04.738
Left side is a rule based
ordering, so we are saying the

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9913-1
01:00:04.738 --> 01:00:07.701
Rule 1 to Rule 4 and then we are
saying the ranking.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9939-0
01:00:07.991 --> 01:00:12.647
So like here we are giving the
ranking and based on the rank

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9939-1
01:00:12.647 --> 01:00:14.631
the the rule will be used.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9959-0
01:00:16.321 --> 01:00:19.565
So first, truly, if it is not a
place then try to use second

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9957-0
01:00:16.481 --> 01:00:17.841
And what will be there? Yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9959-1
01:00:19.565 --> 01:00:19.831
rule.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9974-0
01:00:19.881 --> 01:00:23.111
Otherwise, try to use third rule
and finally go to the 4th.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9991-0
01:00:23.601 --> 01:00:24.061
Is that clear?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/9981-0
01:00:24.961 --> 01:00:25.531
Yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10009-0
01:00:25.541 --> 01:00:29.161
So it is for the rule based
ordering, but what about class

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10006-0
01:00:28.721 --> 01:00:31.101
Yeah, class based.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10009-1
01:00:29.161 --> 01:00:30.081
based ordering?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10029-0
01:00:31.111 --> 01:00:34.702
We are saying that the class
label is no or yes, so the no

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10029-1
01:00:34.702 --> 01:00:36.771
has got higher priority than
yes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10051-0
01:00:36.821 --> 01:00:39.611
So then we are going to put all
the nodes at the top and yes at

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10051-1
01:00:39.611 --> 01:00:40.091
the bottom.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10053-0
01:00:40.911 --> 01:00:42.211
Oh, OK, got it.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10072-0
01:00:44.971 --> 01:00:48.831
Alright, so you can see that the
yes got shifted in the right set

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10072-1
01:00:48.831 --> 01:00:49.591
of the rules.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10077-0
01:00:52.001 --> 01:00:53.381
OK, OK, got it.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10082-0
01:00:55.951 --> 01:00:56.581
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10087-0
01:00:56.631 --> 01:00:58.691
So let us take 5 minute break.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10093-0
01:01:02.431 --> 01:01:02.891
That one?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10096-0
01:01:02.941 --> 01:01:03.551
One question, Sir.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10098-0
01:01:04.491 --> 01:01:04.651
Yes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10121-0
01:01:06.411 --> 01:01:09.447
OK, so whenever we are making
this rules, this is not we are

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10121-1
01:01:09.447 --> 01:01:10.841
not going to write it right?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10146-0
01:01:10.851 --> 01:01:13.712
Like with the training data,
that algorithm is going to

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10146-1
01:01:13.712 --> 01:01:15.501
create all these sets, right,
Sir?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10143-0
01:01:15.061 --> 01:01:16.071
Yes, that is correct.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10150-0
01:01:16.081 --> 01:01:16.721
Yes, yes, yes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10169-0
01:01:17.611 --> 01:01:21.537
OK, so the ordering I mean how
how are we going to give the

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10169-1
01:01:21.537 --> 01:01:22.781
weightage for this?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10173-0
01:01:22.791 --> 01:01:23.741
This is the ordering or.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10184-0
01:01:25.271 --> 01:01:27.591
See this when you're writing a
program.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10205-0
01:01:27.601 --> 01:01:31.913
Obviously you're going to tell
what is the ordering that you

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10205-1
01:01:31.913 --> 01:01:33.681
want to give, so you can.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10227-0
01:01:33.691 --> 01:01:37.152
You can find the mechanisms to
tell what is the what is it that

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10227-1
01:01:37.152 --> 01:01:38.071
you want to give.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10248-0
01:01:38.231 --> 01:01:40.647
Otherwise you will ask the
machine to give the rules

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10248-1
01:01:40.647 --> 01:01:43.291
without ordering, and then you
manually order them right.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10259-0
01:01:45.211 --> 01:01:46.681
OK, it's not like, OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10262-0
01:01:46.731 --> 01:01:47.121
Got it.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10273-0
01:01:47.131 --> 01:01:48.521
Sir, I thought like a.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10270-0
01:01:47.851 --> 01:01:48.581
No, you can.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10276-0
01:01:48.591 --> 01:01:50.981
You can see see and Mr
Sebastian.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10336-0
01:01:50.991 --> 01:01:54.315
Nothing stopping saying that any
rule which is got a highest

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10336-1
01:01:54.315 --> 01:01:57.748
accuracy and then the coverage I
want to give it the so the we

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10336-2
01:01:57.748 --> 01:02:01.291
are going to learn some metrics
I you can say that based on this

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10336-3
01:02:01.291 --> 01:02:03.961
metric you want to order when
that is your call.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10351-0
01:02:04.071 --> 01:02:07.349
I'm not saying that should be
the one, but you can do that

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10351-1
01:02:07.349 --> 01:02:08.461
right accuracy fine.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10355-0
01:02:08.471 --> 01:02:08.941
Go for it.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10367-0
01:02:10.761 --> 01:02:11.271
Can you tell?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10374-0
01:02:11.431 --> 01:02:15.201
Sir, for the class one, the
class ordering.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10379-0
01:02:15.211 --> 01:02:17.041
So like the column.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10405-0
01:02:17.051 --> 01:02:20.877
How we are designating that this
is my class and then based on

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10405-1
01:02:20.877 --> 01:02:22.821
that we are procuring our rules.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10418-0
01:02:23.331 --> 01:02:24.961
So like if.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10410-0
01:02:24.051 --> 01:02:25.081
You know you are.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10425-0
01:02:25.091 --> 01:02:28.221
You are looking at the current
slide the the this slide.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10442-0
01:02:28.331 --> 01:02:29.451
This is the one you are asking.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10438-0
01:02:29.111 --> 01:02:29.661
I know.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10444-0
01:02:30.011 --> 01:02:31.341
Yes, exactly.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10452-0
01:02:31.351 --> 01:02:32.671
So the class based.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10481-0
01:02:32.721 --> 01:02:36.624
So in this like how we are
basically classifying that

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10481-1
01:02:36.624 --> 01:02:40.961
column to be a class and then
based on that we are going to

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10481-2
01:02:40.961 --> 01:02:42.551
restructure the rules.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10500-0
01:02:43.321 --> 01:02:45.241
So can you just enlighten that?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10492-0
01:02:44.521 --> 01:02:45.251
No, no.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10496-0
01:02:45.301 --> 01:02:46.391
Now you tell me.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10511-0
01:02:46.401 --> 01:02:48.801
Suppose that there is a critical
epidemic is spreading.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10517-0
01:02:49.681 --> 01:02:52.001
So what should the doctor
prioritize?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10515-0
01:02:50.211 --> 01:02:50.451
Like.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10528-0
01:02:52.471 --> 01:02:54.631
So whether the Class 0 or class
yes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10538-0
01:02:56.491 --> 01:02:57.811
Uh, yes, but.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10551-0
01:02:58.581 --> 01:03:01.746
Last year, slightest suspicion
the doctor should say

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10551-1
01:03:01.746 --> 01:03:02.821
quarantine, right?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10561-0
01:03:03.871 --> 01:03:04.901
Exactly, Sir. Right.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10558-0
01:03:05.181 --> 01:03:06.111
So now you are.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10573-0
01:03:06.121 --> 01:03:08.881
You are clarity that which class
should be at the top right.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10574-0
01:03:09.691 --> 01:03:10.191
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10578-0
01:03:10.201 --> 01:03:11.011
OK, OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10582-0
01:03:11.221 --> 01:03:12.171
But it's OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10586-0
01:03:12.281 --> 01:03:12.741
Thank you, Sir.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10601-0
01:03:36.961 --> 01:03:38.341
For that, there are some.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10715-0
01:08:03.781 --> 01:08:05.421
OK, let's get started.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10729-0
01:08:08.771 --> 01:08:14.101
So we will look at some methods
to evaluate the rules.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10748-0
01:08:14.721 --> 01:08:20.309
So there are some methods that
have been proposed and we'll see

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10748-1
01:08:20.309 --> 01:08:21.531
how they work.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10758-0
01:08:22.861 --> 01:08:26.071
So suppose that there is a.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10762-0
01:08:26.121 --> 01:08:27.841
There is a training data.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10766-0
01:08:31.671 --> 01:08:32.231
With the.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10770-0
01:08:36.401 --> 01:08:37.661
With two classes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10778-0
01:08:41.201 --> 01:08:42.031
So what are they?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10786-0
01:08:42.041 --> 01:08:44.678
Positive class and negative
class positive and negative

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10786-1
01:08:44.678 --> 01:08:44.961
right.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10800-0
01:08:49.731 --> 01:08:52.561
And now let us say there are how
many.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10808-0
01:08:52.571 --> 01:08:54.321
Let us take a simple example.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10822-0
01:08:54.651 --> 01:08:59.014
The training data has 200 tuples
with the 100 positive and

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10822-1
01:08:59.014 --> 01:09:00.271
hundred negative.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10844-0
01:09:02.651 --> 01:09:07.011
And we created a rule and then
what the rule is doing is that

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10844-1
01:09:07.011 --> 01:09:09.051
rule is picking up 50 tuples.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10858-0
01:09:11.011 --> 01:09:14.441
And out of these, so we are
saying we created Rule 1.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10866-0
01:09:16.631 --> 01:09:20.411
Rule one such that something is
positive.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10868-0
01:09:24.741 --> 01:09:25.061
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10880-0
01:09:32.711 --> 01:09:34.661
So this is the rule that we
created.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10896-0
01:09:35.131 --> 01:09:41.978
It is picking A50 tuples out of
them, 40 or positive and 10 not

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10896-1
01:09:41.978 --> 01:09:42.941
negative.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10915-0
01:09:45.451 --> 01:09:49.968
So then we will say that the
rule one has given us a foil

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10915-1
01:09:49.968 --> 01:09:50.591
gain of.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10925-0
01:09:51.901 --> 01:09:54.561
So how many positive prime is
40?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10958-0
01:09:55.621 --> 01:10:00.252
So it is giving us a the number
of positive tuples that it has

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10958-1
01:10:00.252 --> 01:10:04.663
picked up, compare and then we
compare it with the negative

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10958-2
01:10:04.663 --> 01:10:06.501
tuples that it picked up.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10966-0
01:10:06.511 --> 01:10:08.681
So it is getting 50 here.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10971-0
01:10:09.171 --> 01:10:11.501
Sorry, 40 days 40.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10980-0
01:10:18.921 --> 01:10:20.761
And then this is 40 by 50.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/10987-0
01:10:23.201 --> 01:10:24.671
This is 100 by 200.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11012-0
01:10:26.301 --> 01:10:30.797
So we will compute this and say
that the rule one is giving us

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11012-1
01:10:30.797 --> 01:10:32.011
so much frigging.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11021-0
01:10:32.301 --> 01:10:34.941
So now let us consider another
Rule Rule 2.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11031-0
01:10:37.951 --> 01:10:39.331
So this works like this.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11053-0
01:10:39.341 --> 01:10:44.630
So it is saying it is also
saying positive, but then this

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11053-1
01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:48.461
is picking up only let's say 5
to apples.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11069-0
01:10:50.381 --> 01:10:55.091
And all five are positive, and
nobody's nothing is negative.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11084-0
01:10:55.781 --> 01:11:00.088
So so now the question will be
is rule one better or Rule 2

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11084-1
01:11:00.088 --> 01:11:00.591
better?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11090-0
01:11:07.371 --> 01:11:07.631
Whoops.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11108-0
01:11:09.281 --> 01:11:12.021
Anybody wants to say rule one.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11105-0
01:11:09.541 --> 01:11:10.201
June 1.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11099-0
01:11:11.021 --> 01:11:11.131
I.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11116-0
01:11:11.431 --> 01:11:11.811
The rule to.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11110-0
01:11:12.071 --> 01:11:12.441
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11139-0
01:11:12.491 --> 01:11:16.272
Yes, in fact, that is what the
expert thinks, because they

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11139-1
01:11:16.272 --> 01:11:20.310
think that it is doing a better
generalization compared to the

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11139-2
01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:20.631
rule.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11150-0
01:11:20.641 --> 01:11:23.601
Two Rule 2 is actually very,
very selective.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11163-0
01:11:23.611 --> 01:11:28.301
And then so it may be may even
be overfitting.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11169-0
01:11:28.311 --> 01:11:29.031
So we don't know.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11204-0
01:11:29.491 --> 01:11:34.222
But then if it is, if it is
still be so selective, people

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11204-1
01:11:34.222 --> 01:11:39.035
say the the the they think that
it should be giving lesser

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11204-2
01:11:39.035 --> 01:11:39.851
weightage.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11212-0
01:11:40.051 --> 01:11:42.581
So in this case, what is the
foil gain?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11220-0
01:11:42.591 --> 01:11:45.111
Foil gain will be 5 multiplied
by.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11231-0
01:11:52.631 --> 01:11:56.131
Log 2 of 15 by 5, right.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11236-0
01:11:57.211 --> 01:11:58.741
So 5 by 5.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11253-0
01:11:58.751 --> 01:12:04.771
So let me get this 15 by 5 minus
log 2 of 100 by 200.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11292-0
01:12:06.351 --> 01:12:11.652
So this is the way we compute
the end the foil gain for the

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11292-1
01:12:11.652 --> 01:12:16.599
1st R1 is going to be higher
than the foil gain for the

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11292-2
01:12:16.599 --> 01:12:17.571
second one.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11300-0
01:12:18.041 --> 01:12:19.851
So we can even do the
computation.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11313-0
01:12:19.861 --> 01:12:22.331
So let us let us also do a
computation.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11315-0
01:12:22.341 --> 01:12:23.281
We can Simply put.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11337-0
01:12:26.421 --> 01:12:31.478
How does coming positive plus
negative as five only that after

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11337-1
01:12:31.478 --> 01:12:32.361
log figure?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11340-0
01:12:33.841 --> 01:12:34.601
Just one minute.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11343-0
01:12:34.611 --> 01:12:34.811
Yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11346-0
01:12:34.821 --> 01:12:35.291
Yeah, I'll.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11350-0
01:12:35.301 --> 01:12:35.971
I'll do this.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11357-0
01:12:36.421 --> 01:12:37.901
I'll do it on this slide.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11366-0
01:12:38.041 --> 01:12:41.721
So we are saying that the
training data is.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11377-0
01:12:45.591 --> 01:12:48.841
Training data is 100 positive
and hundred negative right?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11435-0
01:12:49.231 --> 01:12:54.015
So there are 200 tuples, 200
training datas and the first

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11435-1
01:12:54.015 --> 01:12:59.295
rule is picking up 50 tuples and
out of them out of them 40 are

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11435-2
01:12:59.295 --> 01:13:04.326
positive and 10 or negative and
Rule 2 is picking up five to

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11435-3
01:13:04.326 --> 01:13:07.791
five tuples and all of them are
positive.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11440-0
01:13:11.041 --> 01:13:12.381
So the file gain.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11451-0
01:13:20.421 --> 01:13:25.741
For R1 E equal to 40 multiplied
by.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11459-0
01:13:28.261 --> 01:13:30.571
Log 2 of 40 by 50.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11473-0
01:13:32.271 --> 01:13:36.791
Minus log 2 of 100 by 200.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11491-0
01:13:38.391 --> 01:13:45.501
So so this is this is equal to
let us 40 by 50 is .8, right,

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11491-1
01:13:45.501 --> 01:13:45.851
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11503-0
01:13:45.941 --> 01:13:49.471
So let us do the log 24.8 or if.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11521-0
01:13:51.121 --> 01:14:04.411
Two later, so 0.8 log divided by
two log, so minus .32 right?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11527-0
01:14:06.581 --> 01:14:08.401
So minus 1.32.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11549-0
01:14:20.941 --> 01:14:26.671
And this is minus one, right, so
1 -, 0.32.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11566-0
01:14:27.161 --> 01:14:30.511
So this is equal to .68 into 4.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11568-0
01:14:31.721 --> 01:14:34.601
Is 27.2 right?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11578-0
01:14:35.571 --> 01:14:38.381
OK, so this is the foil gain for
Rule 1.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11600-0
01:14:43.391 --> 01:14:56.511
Rule 2 is 5 multiplied by log 25
by 5 minus log 2 of 100 by 200.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11610-0
01:14:59.541 --> 01:15:02.051
OK, So what is this equal to?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11623-0
01:15:02.061 --> 01:15:05.071
This is equal to 1, so this will
become zero, right?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11637-0
01:15:05.361 --> 01:15:10.581
5 Multiple this is equal to 5 *
1, so that is fine.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11650-0
01:15:15.661 --> 01:15:18.241
So is this clear or someone has
a questions?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11664-0
01:15:25.341 --> 01:15:26.471
I hope it is clear right.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11672-0
01:15:26.101 --> 01:15:27.621
And you're.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11668-0
01:15:26.481 --> 01:15:27.771
The foil foil gain.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11683-0
01:15:27.781 --> 01:15:28.381
How it is working?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11681-0
01:15:29.651 --> 01:15:30.661
I said just one thing.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11707-0
01:15:30.671 --> 01:15:36.021
So 100 plus you are considering
the one which from the class you

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11707-1
01:15:36.021 --> 01:15:38.161
are getting is yes, right.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11720-0
01:15:38.171 --> 01:15:41.381
And the 100 minus is from the
class which is classified as.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11724-0
01:15:41.391 --> 01:15:41.531
No.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11736-0
01:15:42.311 --> 01:15:44.381
Yes, yes, there are two class
problem.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11740-0
01:15:42.481 --> 01:15:43.021
Is that right?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11751-0
01:15:44.391 --> 01:15:46.361
We are doing it for two class
problem.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11753-0
01:15:46.461 --> 01:15:46.921
Exactly.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11789-0
01:15:46.491 --> 01:15:50.133
So in the training data, we got
a balanced 100 positive tuples,

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11762-0
01:15:46.931 --> 01:15:47.471
Exactly. Yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11789-1
01:15:50.133 --> 01:15:53.433
hundred negative tuples, and
rule one has picked up fifty

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11782-0
01:15:52.611 --> 01:15:53.001
FedEx.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11789-2
01:15:53.433 --> 01:15:56.051
among them and Rule 2 picked
only five among.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11796-0
01:15:58.011 --> 01:15:58.461
Got it.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11809-0
01:15:59.101 --> 01:16:02.931
So we are comparing which rule
to pick rule one or Rule 2.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11819-0
01:16:03.061 --> 01:16:06.891
So we are foil, gain algorithm
is going with Rule 1.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11837-0
01:16:08.851 --> 01:16:12.021
Sir, you're 50 + 50.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11832-0
01:16:08.871 --> 01:16:09.591
Sir, if Singh.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11861-0
01:16:12.181 --> 01:16:16.858
Rule 1 picked up form positive
as well as negative tuples as

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11861-1
01:16:16.858 --> 01:16:17.471
well or.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11889-0
01:16:16.901 --> 01:16:20.006
Yes, yes, it is picked up 50
tuples altogether from 200

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11889-1
01:16:20.006 --> 01:16:23.389
tuples and out of them forty
turns out to be positive and 10

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11880-0
01:16:20.671 --> 01:16:21.451
200, OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11889-2
01:16:23.389 --> 01:16:24.831
turned out to be negative.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11890-0
01:16:25.541 --> 01:16:25.661
But.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11896-0
01:16:28.051 --> 01:16:28.321
Uh.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11908-0
01:16:28.331 --> 01:16:30.711
So let's say it was not 100 and
it split.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11920-0
01:16:30.721 --> 01:16:32.651
Let's say it was 130 and 70
then.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11930-0
01:16:33.881 --> 01:16:35.791
Then the root will be different
slightly.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11948-0
01:16:35.801 --> 01:16:41.044
I'm in the same formula we will
use, so let me create another

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11948-1
01:16:41.044 --> 01:16:41.551
slide.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11959-0
01:16:45.221 --> 01:16:47.261
OK, so let me erase you the
data.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/11969-0
01:16:51.701 --> 01:16:54.771
OK, so all that you are saying
is, uh.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12008-0
01:17:00.071 --> 01:17:05.258
So so the training data has got
training data, has got 200

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12008-1
01:17:05.258 --> 01:17:10.533
tuples out of them, 130 are
positive and 70 or negative and

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12008-2
01:17:10.533 --> 01:17:14.401
then say rule one and rule two
are similar.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12045-0
01:17:14.761 --> 01:17:22.604
So the formula is that the file
gain for file gain for rule one

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12045-1
01:17:22.604 --> 01:17:30.203
will be 40 multiplied by log 2
of 40 by 50 minus log 2 of 130

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12045-2
01:17:30.203 --> 01:17:31.061
by 200.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12049-0
01:17:34.031 --> 01:17:34.831
OK, this is.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12056-0
01:17:38.811 --> 01:17:39.831
I hope it is clear right.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12080-0
01:17:43.181 --> 01:17:46.646
The person who I forgot the name
of, the person who brought up

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12069-0
01:17:43.891 --> 01:17:44.071
Yep.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12072-0
01:17:44.221 --> 01:17:44.381
Yes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12089-0
01:17:46.471 --> 01:17:48.461
Yes, Sir.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12080-1
01:17:46.646 --> 01:17:47.141
that one.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12087-0
01:17:47.891 --> 01:17:48.631
Yeah, just keep.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12137-0
01:17:49.151 --> 01:17:53.333
The only thing I have in like
why we are only considering the

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12098-0
01:17:49.191 --> 01:17:49.731
Yes, yes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12137-1
01:17:53.333 --> 01:17:57.650
positive tuples like why we are
taking only log 2 of 130 by 200

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12137-2
01:17:57.650 --> 01:17:59.201
not log 2 of 70 by 200.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12138-0
01:17:59.261 --> 01:18:00.821
Ah, OK, OK. OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12150-0
01:18:00.831 --> 01:18:04.001
So suppose that you have created
a rule of negative class.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12156-0
01:18:04.271 --> 01:18:05.361
Then you will take that.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12176-0
01:18:05.411 --> 01:18:10.075
Suppose that something implies
negative, so then you take that

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12177-0
01:18:08.851 --> 01:18:09.431
OK. OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12176-1
01:18:10.075 --> 01:18:10.741
negative.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12223-0
01:18:10.541 --> 01:18:10.971
That we.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12209-0
01:18:10.811 --> 01:18:13.928
So essentially whatever the
class that the rule is

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12209-1
01:18:13.928 --> 01:18:14.601
triggering.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12211-0
01:18:15.231 --> 01:18:16.201
So that is what.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12217-0
01:18:16.251 --> 01:18:18.882
So we are assuming that the
positive class is more important

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12217-1
01:18:18.882 --> 01:18:19.961
and then we went with it.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12242-0
01:18:19.971 --> 01:18:22.697
But suppose that the rule is
triggering negative class,

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12242-1
01:18:22.697 --> 01:18:25.423
saying that if these attributes
are there, take this as

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12242-2
01:18:25.423 --> 01:18:25.861
negative.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12254-0
01:18:26.351 --> 01:18:29.486
Then you need to do all the
calculations assuming the new

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12254-1
01:18:29.486 --> 01:18:29.811
class.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12267-0
01:18:31.471 --> 01:18:32.981
Uh, so is there anything like
that?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12311-0
01:18:32.991 --> 01:18:36.719
If foil gain for R1 is high,
then we need to when then then

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12311-1
01:18:36.719 --> 01:18:40.634
the rule is very important or
one is important rather than not

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12311-2
01:18:40.634 --> 01:18:42.001
to visit like that or.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12302-0
01:18:41.261 --> 01:18:42.171
See, that is what.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12308-0
01:18:42.181 --> 01:18:42.791
No, no, no.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12314-0
01:18:42.801 --> 01:18:43.811
No, no, no, nobody.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12383-0
01:18:43.821 --> 01:18:47.909
Nobody will come to you a domain
and is going to say how to give

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12383-1
01:18:47.909 --> 01:18:51.809
importance to the rules, but
then this is one thing which the

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12383-2
01:18:51.809 --> 01:18:55.331
data scientists found to be
useful while creating these

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12383-3
01:18:55.331 --> 01:18:59.231
running these algorithms that
the file gain is going to be in

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12383-4
01:18:59.231 --> 01:19:02.879
general with the data sets it it
seems to have a give way

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12383-5
01:19:02.879 --> 01:19:04.011
interesting rules.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12397-0
01:19:04.341 --> 01:19:07.291
So this is pretty much saying
like the decision tree.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12412-0
01:19:07.301 --> 01:19:11.002
Also, we said we we should not
do overfitting, so we should

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12412-1
01:19:11.002 --> 01:19:11.681
stop early.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12443-0
01:19:11.961 --> 01:19:15.820
So they we were using several
major so similarly this is your

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12443-1
01:19:15.820 --> 01:19:19.804
major which is saying that OK go
for the rule which is having a

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12443-2
01:19:19.804 --> 01:19:22.481
superior coverage along with the
accuracy.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12447-0
01:19:25.931 --> 01:19:26.391
Thinking.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12452-0
01:19:31.221 --> 01:19:31.541
It's a.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12459-0
01:19:33.221 --> 01:19:36.711
Yes, yes, yes, someone has a
question.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12486-0
01:19:46.911 --> 01:19:51.472
So similar to foil gain, OK, we
have also we have also got

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12486-1
01:19:51.472 --> 01:19:54.951
another criteria which is called
foil prune.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12496-0
01:19:58.691 --> 01:19:59.981
Sir, I have a question.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12506-0
01:20:00.251 --> 01:20:03.581
So so we need the calculation.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12501-0
01:20:00.791 --> 01:20:00.931
Yes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12516-0
01:20:03.591 --> 01:20:05.791
We found that 27 and five,
right.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12524-0
01:20:06.451 --> 01:20:06.971
Hmm. Yes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12518-0
01:20:06.991 --> 01:20:07.261
What?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12531-0
01:20:07.271 --> 01:20:09.491
What does that signifies,
basically?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12556-0
01:20:10.381 --> 01:20:13.481
No, it signifies that the rule
when has got a better foil gain

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12556-1
01:20:13.481 --> 01:20:16.483
and should be preferred if you
think that the foil gain is a

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12556-2
01:20:16.483 --> 01:20:17.221
good heuristic.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12558-0
01:20:19.931 --> 01:20:20.141
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12562-0
01:20:23.721 --> 01:20:24.461
Fine, yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12611-0
01:20:27.521 --> 01:20:32.650
Then another thing that people
do is that we use the foil gain

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12611-1
01:20:32.650 --> 01:20:37.699
on the training tuples because
it is, we do not have the test

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12611-2
01:20:37.699 --> 01:20:42.421
data, so we are only building
the rules from the training

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12611-3
01:20:42.421 --> 01:20:45.271
data, say after the rule is
built.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12624-0
01:20:45.701 --> 01:20:49.931
Suppose that I got a rule which
is which runs like this.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12669-0
01:20:56.271 --> 01:21:00.288
So for we, if we need to analyze
while gain right the so we need

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12669-1
01:21:00.288 --> 01:21:04.181
to have more than one rules and
then only we can compare them.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12656-0
01:21:01.051 --> 01:21:01.261
Hmm.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12692-0
01:21:04.351 --> 01:21:08.835
But yeah, I mean having a foil
gain for a single rule doesn't

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12667-0
01:21:04.611 --> 01:21:05.341
That is correct.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12681-0
01:21:05.351 --> 01:21:06.911
That is correct, yes, but.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12692-1
01:21:08.835 --> 01:21:10.571
signify anything, right?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12694-0
01:21:11.481 --> 01:21:12.351
That is correct.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12701-0
01:21:12.461 --> 01:21:13.091
That is correct.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12711-0
01:21:13.481 --> 01:21:15.711
Yes, foil gain for single rule.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12707-0
01:21:13.841 --> 01:21:14.021
Of.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12732-0
01:21:15.781 --> 01:21:20.994
It can signify only to the
extent that it is combining

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12732-1
01:21:20.994 --> 01:21:24.691
coverage and accuracy well, and
it is.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12750-0
01:21:24.801 --> 01:21:29.392
It is giving a formula of which
combines both of them and and

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12750-1
01:21:29.392 --> 01:21:29.911
our in.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12757-0
01:21:30.041 --> 01:21:32.051
Both of them are desirable
features.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12785-0
01:21:32.061 --> 01:21:35.716
Let's say we believe both of
them are desirable, then

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12785-1
01:21:35.716 --> 01:21:39.641
obviously, uh higher number
indicates that something good

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12785-2
01:21:39.641 --> 01:21:41.401
about the rule, is it not?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12836-0
01:21:44.451 --> 01:21:47.935
Higher with respect to what,
Sir, when we say higher number,

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12836-1
01:21:47.935 --> 01:21:51.590
if we have just one rule, right,
even five is higher if we have

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12816-0
01:21:49.481 --> 01:21:49.761
Hmm.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12836-2
01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:54.331
you know when we don't have a
range, right, so.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12830-0
01:21:53.981 --> 01:21:54.411
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12839-0
01:21:54.421 --> 01:21:56.351
So you are saying no other rule
exist?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12852-0
01:21:56.761 --> 01:21:59.851
OK, no other rule exist then
yes, fine.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12849-0
01:21:56.841 --> 01:21:57.481
Yeah, correct.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12872-0
01:21:59.961 --> 01:22:03.561
So OK, then there is nothing
that we can do, right? Yes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12886-0
01:22:03.781 --> 01:22:06.647
Yeah, it's it's probably works
better in the comparison.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12886-1
01:22:06.647 --> 01:22:07.301
Individually.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12901-0
01:22:07.311 --> 01:22:08.821
It has no relevance in my.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12891-0
01:22:07.871 --> 01:22:08.801
Meet and see.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12904-0
01:22:08.811 --> 01:22:10.411
See in fact, the entire thing.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12916-0
01:22:10.421 --> 01:22:13.902
For example, the Gini or
entropy, they are all for the

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12916-1
01:22:13.902 --> 01:22:15.041
comparison, right?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12926-0
01:22:15.531 --> 01:22:18.141
Because we are comparing, we
have multiple attributes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12961-0
01:22:18.151 --> 01:22:21.091
We are comparing the how much
entropy we are gaining by going

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12961-1
01:22:21.091 --> 01:22:24.078
for each one of the attributes
and we are picking up whichever

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12960-0
01:22:23.421 --> 01:22:23.691
Correct.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12961-2
01:22:24.078 --> 01:22:25.121
is giving us the best.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12966-0
01:22:26.931 --> 01:22:27.471
Makes sense?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12967-0
01:22:28.261 --> 01:22:28.671
Yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12982-0
01:22:28.711 --> 01:22:33.051
OK, so now now let us let us
look at a situation.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12988-0
01:22:33.321 --> 01:22:35.471
Suppose that we created a rule.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/12992-0
01:22:37.711 --> 01:22:38.531
Rules.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13003-0
01:22:38.541 --> 01:22:43.041
Uh, let us say, uh attribute one
is equal to X.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13027-0
01:22:45.191 --> 01:22:54.972
And attribute 2 is equal to Y
and attribute 3 is equal to jet

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13027-1
01:22:54.972 --> 01:22:58.601
implies positive class.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13049-0
01:22:58.851 --> 01:23:05.265
OK, so now now what we have is
that we, we are testing this on

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13049-1
01:23:05.265 --> 01:23:06.691
the test data.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13060-0
01:23:07.581 --> 01:23:12.281
So at this point, we bring in a
metric called foil prune.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13069-0
01:23:15.101 --> 01:23:16.401
So this is working.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13076-0
01:23:16.411 --> 01:23:17.891
Let us say this is working.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13079-0
01:23:17.901 --> 01:23:19.351
So far so good.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13089-0
01:23:19.361 --> 01:23:21.151
So now let us say it is.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13110-0
01:23:21.441 --> 01:23:28.144
It is a selecting, let us say 50
tuples OK and then it is giving

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13110-1
01:23:28.144 --> 01:23:30.001
us an accuracy of.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13113-0
01:23:32.521 --> 01:23:32.981
40.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13122-0
01:23:35.511 --> 01:23:39.051
And then 10, let us see.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13139-0
01:23:39.121 --> 01:23:45.259
OK, so now now let us say we
prune, prune one of the one of

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13139-1
01:23:45.259 --> 01:23:45.771
them.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13144-0
01:23:45.781 --> 01:23:46.931
Let us say we prune.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13167-0
01:23:49.461 --> 01:23:53.519
We prune this part and now we
got a simpler rule, so this will

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13167-1
01:23:53.519 --> 01:23:55.451
have a better coverage, right?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13178-0
01:23:55.981 --> 01:23:58.291
So we are testing now.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13184-0
01:23:58.301 --> 01:24:00.231
It's a now it is covering.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13199-0
01:24:00.941 --> 01:24:06.031
Now it is covering let's say 100
tuples and out of them 85.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13209-0
01:24:09.881 --> 01:24:14.251
Or positive and 15 or negative.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13239-0
01:24:15.231 --> 01:24:23.269
So now the foil prune in this
case is foil prune for this one

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13239-1
01:24:23.269 --> 01:24:26.121
is 40 -, 10 / 40 + 10.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13262-0
01:24:26.691 --> 01:24:37.901
So this is .6 and this one is 85
-, 15 / 85 + 15.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13268-0
01:24:38.651 --> 01:24:40.781
So this is .7.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13311-0
01:24:41.431 --> 01:24:47.450
So what we see is that the rule
is getting better when we prune,

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13311-1
01:24:47.450 --> 01:24:53.100
so file prune is saying that if
we are getting a pruned rule

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13311-2
01:24:53.100 --> 01:24:58.471
with higher foil prune value
then just go and prune that.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13329-0
01:25:00.251 --> 01:25:03.771
So this is generally this is
done recommended to be done on

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13329-1
01:25:03.771 --> 01:25:05.531
independent set of test tools.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13338-0
01:25:09.451 --> 01:25:09.941
No, Sir.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13377-0
01:25:09.951 --> 01:25:13.333
I have a question here like
whatever things we are doing

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13377-1
01:25:13.333 --> 01:25:17.131
right now, we are just assuming
that it will fall into only two

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13377-2
01:25:17.131 --> 01:25:19.861
buckets like binary
classification like what?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13385-0
01:25:18.631 --> 01:25:19.611
Yes, yes. OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13383-0
01:25:19.871 --> 01:25:20.651
What is the like?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13409-0
01:25:20.701 --> 01:25:23.316
So these things doesn't apply
when let's say the

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13409-1
01:25:23.316 --> 01:25:26.251
classification needs to be done
on two or more, right?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13405-0
01:25:26.961 --> 01:25:27.411
No, no.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13420-0
01:25:27.421 --> 01:25:31.889
Suppose that there are five
classes that are possible, so

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13420-1
01:25:31.889 --> 01:25:32.891
five classes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13440-0
01:25:32.901 --> 01:25:36.182
What you can do is that your
rule will only indicate one

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13440-1
01:25:36.182 --> 01:25:36.931
class, right?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13466-0
01:25:37.751 --> 01:25:40.821
And So what you can say is that
that class you call it as a

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13466-1
01:25:40.821 --> 01:25:43.841
positive class and every other
class has a negative class.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13477-0
01:25:44.131 --> 01:25:46.211
Mr Parikh, it then we can do it
right.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13479-0
01:25:47.551 --> 01:25:48.211
OK, OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13526-0
01:25:54.111 --> 01:25:58.153
So say for sorry for for the
case what we are discussing for

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13487-0
01:25:54.531 --> 01:25:54.891
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13498-0
01:25:56.001 --> 01:25:57.091
Yeah. Yes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13526-1
01:25:58.153 --> 01:26:02.328
like say positive negative and
suppose there there there might

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13526-2
01:26:02.328 --> 01:26:05.641
be a rule which will not give
any output of that.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13540-0
01:26:05.651 --> 01:26:06.781
Then I will do that.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13537-0
01:26:07.301 --> 01:26:07.991
No, no, no.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13570-0
01:26:08.001 --> 01:26:10.814
If if we root see we are
starting with a training data

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13570-1
01:26:10.814 --> 01:26:14.037
and training data, every tuple
we are assuming that there is a

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13570-2
01:26:14.037 --> 01:26:14.651
class label.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13609-0
01:26:15.481 --> 01:26:19.330
So if we are got, we have got
some customers for our company

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13609-1
01:26:19.330 --> 01:26:23.117
and we know who whom we could
sell the product successfully

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13609-2
01:26:23.117 --> 01:26:26.651
and we whom we could not sell
the product successfully.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13621-0
01:26:26.941 --> 01:26:29.091
So we take only them as training
data.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13636-0
01:26:29.101 --> 01:26:32.251
We so we know whether the person
bought or we did not buy.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13658-0
01:26:32.601 --> 01:26:35.375
So if there is somebody whom you
don't know, then that person

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13658-1
01:26:35.375 --> 01:26:37.881
obviously will not help you in
building a model, right?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13675-0
01:26:40.741 --> 01:26:43.479
So the class label is known,
then only we will start building

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13675-1
01:26:43.479 --> 01:26:43.921
the model.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13679-0
01:26:44.701 --> 01:26:45.671
The training data.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13688-0
01:26:45.961 --> 01:26:47.521
Mr Willandra, are we In Sync?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13691-0
01:26:48.611 --> 01:26:49.941
Yeah, it's no.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13700-0
01:26:49.951 --> 01:26:52.321
So what I was asking is
basically different.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13721-0
01:26:52.331 --> 01:26:57.693
So for example, we are writing a
rule wherein we are finding the

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13721-1
01:26:57.693 --> 01:26:58.931
positive right.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13725-0
01:26:58.671 --> 01:26:58.811
Yes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13743-0
01:26:58.981 --> 01:27:02.525
So that rule will give either
positive or negative in case if

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13738-0
01:27:02.431 --> 01:27:02.571
Yes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13743-1
01:27:02.525 --> 01:27:05.441
the rule will give positive,
negative and unknown.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13749-0
01:27:05.451 --> 01:27:06.251
Something like that.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13755-0
01:27:06.531 --> 01:27:06.981
No, no.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13763-0
01:27:06.651 --> 01:27:07.551
What will be the case?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13758-0
01:27:06.991 --> 01:27:07.561
OK, OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13761-0
01:27:07.571 --> 01:27:08.151
So no.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13764-0
01:27:08.231 --> 01:27:08.541
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13794-0
01:27:08.551 --> 01:27:12.445
OK, Paul, unknown is it cannot
give unknown because clearly in

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13794-1
01:27:12.445 --> 01:27:15.721
the training data every tuple
has got a class label.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13818-0
01:27:16.191 --> 01:27:19.976
So you can you can so so you can
you are going to obviously the

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13809-0
01:27:16.321 --> 01:27:17.581
Translate well, OK, got it.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13818-1
01:27:19.976 --> 01:27:20.981
create the rules.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13822-0
01:27:20.991 --> 01:27:22.261
So what can happen?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13857-0
01:27:22.271 --> 01:27:26.127
Is that suppose the rule selects
50 tuples out of than 25 or

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13850-0
01:27:25.661 --> 01:27:25.881
Umm.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13857-1
01:27:26.127 --> 01:27:27.961
positive and 25 are negative.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13881-0
01:27:28.271 --> 01:27:31.292
So in that case, we need to
think in terms of should we

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13870-0
01:27:28.891 --> 01:27:29.211
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13881-1
01:27:31.292 --> 01:27:34.151
consider this rule or simply
look at something else?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13882-0
01:27:34.881 --> 01:27:35.611
Something else?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13885-0
01:27:35.621 --> 01:27:36.341
OK, got it.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13903-0
01:27:42.271 --> 01:27:47.254
So similar to foil gain, we got
another statistic which is

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13903-1
01:27:47.254 --> 01:27:49.281
called likelihood ratio.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13930-0
01:27:49.811 --> 01:27:55.352
This looks a little bit like a
chi square approach, So what it

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13930-1
01:27:55.352 --> 01:28:00.541
does is that it is going to
compute expected and observed.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13942-0
01:28:01.561 --> 01:28:04.491
So so now now it goes like this.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/13953-0
01:28:04.921 --> 01:28:09.121
Suppose that we have got
training data with the.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14000-0
01:28:13.661 --> 01:28:19.241
200 tuples and out of them
hundred are positive and hundred

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14000-1
01:28:19.241 --> 01:28:24.635
are negative and then rule one
is triggering 50 tuples is

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14000-2
01:28:24.635 --> 01:28:30.402
selecting 50 tuples and out of
them 40 or positive and and 10

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14000-3
01:28:30.402 --> 01:28:31.611
are negative.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14014-0
01:28:32.101 --> 01:28:36.111
So what we do is that this is
this is the observed.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14018-0
01:28:37.811 --> 01:28:40.421
Now we compute the expected.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14027-0
01:28:43.961 --> 01:28:47.151
Suppose we create a random dumb
rule.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14050-0
01:28:47.281 --> 01:28:53.703
So what it will get, it will get
50, so we should get 25 positive

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14050-1
01:28:53.703 --> 01:28:55.941
and 25 negative, right?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14077-0
01:28:56.561 --> 01:29:00.320
Because training data has 100
positive and hundred negative,

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14077-1
01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:03.586
so a random rule is going to
give 25 positive and 25

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14077-2
01:29:03.586 --> 01:29:04.141
negative.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14101-0
01:29:04.571 --> 01:29:08.346
So now we compare Rule 1
likelihood ratio statistic is

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14101-1
01:29:08.346 --> 01:29:12.533
that it is comparing the expect
observed with respect to the

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14101-2
01:29:12.533 --> 01:29:13.151
expected.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14116-0
01:29:14.211 --> 01:29:19.240
So now this is going to create a
formula which is saying that

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14116-1
01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:20.051
summation.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14124-0
01:29:22.001 --> 01:29:24.241
So we can remove the summation
so.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14132-0
01:29:26.551 --> 01:29:28.541
So there are two rules here.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14136-0
01:29:28.551 --> 01:29:29.381
There are two classes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14148-0
01:29:34.671 --> 01:29:37.681
So this will come out to class.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14153-0
01:29:37.691 --> 01:29:39.771
One has got 40 to apples.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14169-0
01:29:41.921 --> 01:29:50.811
And multiplied by log two of
UH-40 by 25.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14182-0
01:29:53.301 --> 01:29:58.881
Bless Glass two has 10 tuples
multiplied by.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14215-0
01:30:01.701 --> 01:30:07.556
Log 2 of 10 by 25 so we compute
this so the higher the

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14215-1
01:30:07.556 --> 01:30:14.051
likelihood ratio statistic, the
rule turns out to be better.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14226-0
01:30:14.061 --> 01:30:17.381
Again, this is also using the
same logic which is based on.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14242-0
01:30:18.861 --> 01:30:22.921
The coverage and accuracy of
both of them come together.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14245-0
01:30:23.721 --> 01:30:24.701
The rule gets better.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14264-0
01:30:27.691 --> 01:30:33.619
So you can you you can do the
calculation I hope or we can so

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14264-1
01:30:33.619 --> 01:30:34.671
so this is.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14278-0
01:30:36.681 --> 01:30:41.451
So there are classifier rule
based classifiers.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14295-0
01:30:41.901 --> 01:30:47.830
So some of them depend on direct
methods, so they extract rules

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14295-1
01:30:47.830 --> 01:30:49.961
directly from the data.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14312-0
01:30:54.891 --> 01:30:59.821
And then there are others which
use indirect approach.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14336-0
01:31:00.051 --> 01:31:03.482
So the first constructed
decision tree or construct a

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14336-1
01:31:03.482 --> 01:31:07.041
neural network, and from there
they're going to derive.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14344-0
01:31:07.171 --> 01:31:10.031
So the C 4.5 derives it from the
decision.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14365-0
01:31:15.781 --> 01:31:20.150
So for the direct method, there
is a algorithm that is called as

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14365-1
01:31:20.150 --> 01:31:22.301
a sequential covering algorithm.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14380-0
01:31:23.491 --> 01:31:29.228
So what it does is that it the
IT learns the rules

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14380-1
01:31:29.228 --> 01:31:30.691
sequentially.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14406-0
01:31:32.471 --> 01:31:37.488
And the such that for every
class it will cover as many

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14406-1
01:31:37.488 --> 01:31:42.684
tuples of class that class and
possibly none of the other

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14406-2
01:31:42.684 --> 01:31:43.401
classes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14422-0
01:31:45.761 --> 01:31:49.161
So so suppose that if I have to
draw it as a picture.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14448-0
01:32:04.781 --> 01:32:09.988
So what I'm going to do is that
the first time going to create a

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14448-1
01:32:09.988 --> 01:32:11.911
rule which is like this.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14463-0
01:32:11.921 --> 01:32:15.417
Suppose that there are two
attributes, so let me put this

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14463-1
01:32:15.417 --> 01:32:16.321
is attribute 1.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14470-0
01:32:18.811 --> 01:32:20.401
And this is attribute.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14485-0
01:32:24.201 --> 01:32:28.531
And we have some training data 7
tuples.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14498-0
01:32:29.061 --> 01:32:33.391
So here we are getting clearly a
rule which is pure.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14519-0
01:32:33.441 --> 01:32:36.976
So we are seeing that by drawing
line here we are getting 2

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14519-1
01:32:36.976 --> 01:32:39.451
positive tuples and zero
negative tuples.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14536-0
01:32:40.221 --> 01:32:44.256
So we we have learned and then
we can we have the evaluation

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14536-1
01:32:44.256 --> 01:32:44.851
measures.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14566-0
01:32:45.281 --> 01:32:50.090
So we look, keep looking for
them and then once the rule is

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14566-1
01:32:50.090 --> 01:32:55.220
learned, once it is learned, the
tuples covered by the rule are

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14566-2
01:32:55.220 --> 01:32:55.861
removed.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14593-0
01:32:58.461 --> 01:33:02.270
And what we will do the
remaining tuples we are going to

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14593-1
01:33:02.270 --> 01:33:05.211
create another rule or and then
we proceed.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14615-0
01:33:05.781 --> 01:33:09.197
So again, we once the second
rule is created, all the tuples

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14615-1
01:33:09.197 --> 01:33:11.381
covered by the second rule or
removed.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14640-0
01:33:11.761 --> 01:33:15.972
So we keep we come to a
condition where there are no

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14640-1
01:33:15.972 --> 01:33:20.421
more training rig examples or
the quality of the rules.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14643-0
01:33:21.791 --> 01:33:23.351
He's below threshold.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14657-0
01:33:31.321 --> 01:33:34.021
So so this is the this is the
approach.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14674-0
01:33:34.031 --> 01:33:40.123
So in a decision tree, so the
typical way we proceed is we go

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14674-1
01:33:40.123 --> 01:33:42.481
with a breadth approach.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14678-0
01:33:45.061 --> 01:33:46.151
And the rules.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14704-0
01:33:47.861 --> 01:33:52.905
So essentially we are trying to
find many rules at the same

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14704-1
01:33:52.905 --> 01:33:56.941
time, but then this is going by
depth approach.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14731-0
01:33:59.261 --> 01:34:03.129
So it is trying to find a rule
first the entire path it wants

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14731-1
01:34:03.129 --> 01:34:05.251
to trace and wants to get a
rule.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14740-0
01:34:05.741 --> 01:34:09.111
Then it is going to see if it
can find more.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14757-0
01:34:13.631 --> 01:34:18.471
So so now suppose this is the
data that we have.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14786-0
01:34:19.301 --> 01:34:24.272
So we are looking at the
examples covered by rule one,

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14786-1
01:34:24.272 --> 01:34:30.056
rule two Rule 3 and we are going
to remove those those and then

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14786-2
01:34:30.056 --> 01:34:31.321
keep the rest.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14798-0
01:34:35.891 --> 01:34:37.741
These are these are OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14831-0
01:34:37.791 --> 01:34:43.206
So take it that the there are
also negative tuples in the data

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14831-1
01:34:43.206 --> 01:34:48.450
set and so there are both types
of examples, but then we are

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14831-2
01:34:48.450 --> 01:34:49.911
taking the rules.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14839-0
01:34:51.101 --> 01:34:53.771
Uh, remove the only the tuples.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14841-0
01:34:53.861 --> 01:34:54.501
This is.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14864-0
01:34:56.881 --> 01:35:00.819
And whatever rule we have picked
up, remove the tuples

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14864-1
01:35:00.819 --> 01:35:03.611
corresponding to that tuple that
rule.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14882-0
01:35:16.551 --> 01:35:20.271
So we can see suppose that we
got a data set like this.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14892-0
01:35:21.281 --> 01:35:24.741
So suppose we have created this
rule.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14902-0
01:35:26.141 --> 01:35:28.381
Then we can think in terms of
pruning it, right.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14927-0
01:35:30.761 --> 01:35:36.341
And for the pruning it so now
now the accuracy of the

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14927-1
01:35:36.341 --> 01:35:39.131
innermost rule is the best.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14955-0
01:35:40.111 --> 01:35:45.206
The coverage of the outermost
rule is the best, so we are

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14955-1
01:35:45.206 --> 01:35:51.003
going for combination and we are
going with a rule which is which

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14955-2
01:35:51.003 --> 01:35:52.321
is going to be.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14983-0
01:35:54.131 --> 01:35:58.279
Uh, it essentially the one which
satisfies the heuristics,

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14983-1
01:35:58.279 --> 01:36:02.568
whatever heuristic we want to
consider foil or likelihood or

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14983-2
01:36:02.568 --> 01:36:03.201
whatever.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/14991-0
01:36:12.611 --> 01:36:14.691
So another example of indirect.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15000-0
01:36:18.661 --> 01:36:20.531
So so far I hope it is clear.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15005-0
01:36:25.031 --> 01:36:25.601
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15015-0
01:36:25.661 --> 01:36:29.841
So we will proceed to a a new
topic.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15020-0
01:36:29.851 --> 01:36:31.831
So we have learned so far.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15032-0
01:36:33.771 --> 01:36:38.121
No, we have learned so far 2
classifiers right.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15078-0
01:36:44.071 --> 01:36:47.319
And in each one, actually each
classifier we can by using

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15078-1
01:36:47.319 --> 01:36:50.232
different heuristics or
different approaches we can

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15078-2
01:36:50.232 --> 01:36:53.593
build multiple classifiers
because it is not necessary that

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15078-3
01:36:53.593 --> 01:36:55.161
decision tree has to be one.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15090-0
01:36:55.171 --> 01:36:59.499
We can think in terms of
variations depending on some

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15090-1
01:36:59.499 --> 01:37:00.221
criteria.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15110-0
01:37:00.231 --> 01:37:04.752
We can create a new decision, so
it is even possible that

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15110-1
01:37:04.752 --> 01:37:07.091
sometimes people do something.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15136-0
01:37:07.301 --> 01:37:12.742
So this is the data set so they
divide it into dataset one and

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15136-1
01:37:12.742 --> 01:37:15.851
dataset 2 and create 2
classifiers.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15146-0
01:37:16.041 --> 01:37:18.791
So nothing stops. So there are.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15154-0
01:37:18.921 --> 01:37:22.401
It is possible that we can
create multiple classifiers.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15169-0
01:37:28.591 --> 01:37:31.741
So what is the big deal if we
have the multiple classifiers?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15201-0
01:37:32.471 --> 01:37:38.236
So we can, if we create multiple
classifiers, So what we can do

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15201-1
01:37:38.236 --> 01:37:43.640
is that suppose there is a
multiple classifiers and we have

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15201-2
01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:44.811
a test tuple.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15241-0
01:37:45.741 --> 01:37:50.692
So we are going to give it to
the each of the classifier and

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15241-1
01:37:50.692 --> 01:37:55.642
we are going to see what all
each classifier is going to say

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15241-2
01:37:55.642 --> 01:37:59.051
and then we are going it with
the voting.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15269-0
01:37:59.241 --> 01:38:03.965
So we are going to speak the
class which is color which is

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15269-1
01:38:03.965 --> 01:38:08.529
recommended by the maximum
number of classifiers so that

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15269-2
01:38:08.529 --> 01:38:10.131
can be one approach.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15277-0
01:38:10.141 --> 01:38:12.761
So that is an approach which is
ensemble.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15288-0
01:38:15.211 --> 01:38:16.961
So this can be one approach.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15308-0
01:38:17.491 --> 01:38:20.959
Data we divide multiple
datasets, multiple classifiers

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15308-1
01:38:20.959 --> 01:38:22.661
and combine the classifier.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15318-0
01:38:23.351 --> 01:38:26.411
So So what is going to be the
benefit?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15322-0
01:38:26.991 --> 01:38:28.181
Suppose that.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15324-0
01:38:28.251 --> 01:38:28.971
Assume that.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15332-0
01:38:37.151 --> 01:38:39.271
Classifiers or independent?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15371-0
01:38:44.471 --> 01:38:48.262
Independent in the sense that
the way they create the error,

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15371-1
01:38:48.262 --> 01:38:51.680
each classifier makes some
mistakes and does something

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15371-2
01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:55.285
right, but the way they do it is
independent of the other

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15371-3
01:38:55.285 --> 01:38:56.031
classifiers.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15402-0
01:38:56.871 --> 01:39:02.334
So in that case, we can take
this as a probability that

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15402-1
01:39:02.334 --> 01:39:08.383
classifier is getting right or
wrong and then we can think in

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15402-2
01:39:08.383 --> 01:39:09.261
terms of.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15408-0
01:39:10.011 --> 01:39:11.401
You can think in terms of.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15428-0
01:39:11.681 --> 01:39:16.898
Suppose that each classifier we
create a 25 base classifiers, 25

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15428-1
01:39:16.898 --> 01:39:17.861
classifiers.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15435-0
01:39:18.411 --> 01:39:21.361
Each classifier has got 65%
accuracy.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15454-0
01:39:25.551 --> 01:39:29.962
And now what we are saying is
that the classifier ensemble,

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15454-1
01:39:29.962 --> 01:39:32.461
what is the accuracy of
ensemble?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15481-0
01:39:40.081 --> 01:39:44.713
So accuracy of ensemble depends
when majority of the classifiers

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15481-1
01:39:44.713 --> 01:39:49.061
have to make a mistake, then
only the ensemble will make the

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15481-2
01:39:49.061 --> 01:39:49.631
mistake.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15498-0
01:39:50.201 --> 01:39:55.496
So now let us look at it so to
for the ensemble to make mistake

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15498-1
01:39:55.496 --> 01:39:56.241
at least.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15504-0
01:39:59.261 --> 01:40:00.811
13 classifiers.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15509-0
01:40:03.391 --> 01:40:04.361
How to go wrong?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15528-0
01:40:08.481 --> 01:40:11.883
So and now we are saying that
the classifiers are independent

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15528-1
01:40:11.883 --> 01:40:12.651
of each other.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15548-0
01:40:12.841 --> 01:40:16.211
So what is the probability of 13
classifiers go wrong?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15551-0
01:40:16.221 --> 01:40:19.611
SO25C3C13 right.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15580-0
01:40:20.541 --> 01:40:24.825
So they they because out of the
25 any 13 can go wrong and for

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15580-1
01:40:24.825 --> 01:40:29.041
each of those thirteen sets,
what is the probability of this?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15585-0
01:40:29.051 --> 01:40:31.071
So the .35.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15604-0
01:40:32.421 --> 01:40:37.945
Multiplied by 13 and then the
other classifiers, other 12

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15604-1
01:40:37.945 --> 01:40:40.231
classifiers are correct.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15619-0
01:40:40.241 --> 01:40:43.162
So, right, so other 12
classifiers are giving correct

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15619-1
01:40:43.162 --> 01:40:43.541
answer.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15626-0
01:40:44.251 --> 01:40:47.851
So this is the probability that
13 classifiers.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15630-0
01:40:51.101 --> 01:40:51.791
Or wrong?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15652-0
01:40:53.501 --> 01:40:57.048
Similarly, 14 classifiers can go
wrong, 15 classifiers can go

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15652-1
01:40:57.048 --> 01:40:57.391
wrong.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15662-0
01:40:57.401 --> 01:41:00.691
In all these cases, the ensemble
will make mistake.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15689-0
01:41:01.061 --> 01:41:05.533
So if we consider I is equal to
13 to 15 and we start

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15689-1
01:41:05.533 --> 01:41:10.916
aggregating the errors that each
possible ensemble is doing each

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15689-2
01:41:10.916 --> 01:41:11.661
possible.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15699-0
01:41:13.151 --> 01:41:14.581
Possibility of the error.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15704-0
01:41:14.591 --> 01:41:17.801
For each, it'll be each
combination.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15717-0
01:41:17.811 --> 01:41:20.681
So suppose how many of them go
wrong each time.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15728-0
01:41:21.071 --> 01:41:24.441
So 131415, we keep on trying all
of that.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15747-0
01:41:24.531 --> 01:41:31.043
So the probability adds up to
.06, so this has got a 94%

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15747-1
01:41:31.043 --> 01:41:32.071
accuracy.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15773-0
01:41:36.831 --> 01:41:43.762
So the ensemble has got B, base
classifier has 65% accuracy and

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15773-1
01:41:43.762 --> 01:41:47.011
the ensemble got 94% accuracy.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15779-0
01:41:50.811 --> 01:41:51.781
Is that clear?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15784-0
01:41:54.631 --> 01:41:55.001
No, Sir.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15791-0
01:41:55.011 --> 01:41:55.811
Can you repeat it?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15804-0
01:41:56.621 --> 01:42:01.818
OK, So what I will do is that
I'm going to do a new problem

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15804-1
01:42:01.818 --> 01:42:02.511
because.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15814-0
01:42:04.011 --> 01:42:07.001
So so you will be able to clear.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15829-0
01:42:07.071 --> 01:42:11.411
OK, so so now what I'm saying is
that I have 3 classifiers.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15877-0
01:42:14.221 --> 01:42:17.268
So when you say like 3
independent or let's say an

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15877-1
01:42:17.268 --> 01:42:20.852
independent classifiers, does
that mean that they all those

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15854-0
01:42:19.311 --> 01:42:19.551
Hmm.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15877-2
01:42:20.852 --> 01:42:24.018
the deploy different
classification technique or the

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15877-3
01:42:24.018 --> 01:42:27.244
rules or let's say the decision
trains are completely

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15877-4
01:42:27.244 --> 01:42:27.961
independent?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15900-0
01:42:28.741 --> 01:42:32.301
No, no, they can be independent
in way, but for example random

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15900-1
01:42:32.301 --> 01:42:35.071
forest, you just all of them are
decision trees.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15916-0
01:42:35.081 --> 01:42:37.765
But then each tree constructs
using different set of

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15916-1
01:42:37.765 --> 01:42:39.791
attributes and different set of
tuples.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15924-0
01:42:39.801 --> 01:42:40.871
So that is how it does.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15955-0
01:42:41.221 --> 01:42:44.990
So the way in which we can take
the approach can be but then

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15955-1
01:42:44.990 --> 01:42:48.945
then ensemble approach is we are
talking about but then the way

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/15955-2
01:42:48.945 --> 01:42:50.861
you implement can be different.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16011-0
01:42:53.481 --> 01:42:57.696
And and also it is not easy to
assume that they are the we are

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16011-1
01:42:57.696 --> 01:43:01.843
getting independence between the
classifiers, so that may not

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16011-2
01:43:01.843 --> 01:43:05.590
always the independence
assumption is a bit loaded one,

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16011-3
01:43:05.590 --> 01:43:09.671
but then we are just looking at
the mathematics of ensemble.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16033-0
01:43:09.781 --> 01:43:14.744
If somehow we have created the
independent classifiers, so now

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16033-1
01:43:14.744 --> 01:43:19.471
let us say the N symbol is
consisting of three classifiers.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16044-0
01:43:19.541 --> 01:43:22.441
OK, C1C2 and C3.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16061-0
01:43:23.751 --> 01:43:28.030
So now what we are saying is
that all of them have got a

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16061-1
01:43:28.030 --> 01:43:29.231
accuracy of 80%.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16078-0
01:43:31.721 --> 01:43:35.528
The all of them have got 80%
accuracy so that is 20% error

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16078-1
01:43:35.528 --> 01:43:35.851
rate.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16091-0
01:43:38.531 --> 01:43:41.631
So now let us say we have got a
test tuple.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16134-0
01:43:45.131 --> 01:43:51.856
So so now it is possible that
suppose between C1C2C3, what can

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16134-1
01:43:51.856 --> 01:43:58.262
be the answers so so they are
test tuple so they can give a

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16134-2
01:43:58.262 --> 01:44:01.571
correct answer or wrong answer.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16145-0
01:44:02.321 --> 01:44:06.768
So correct answer all of them
can give correct answer right

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16145-1
01:44:06.768 --> 01:44:06.991
or.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16147-0
01:44:09.491 --> 01:44:09.911
Or.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16174-0
01:44:33.131 --> 01:44:36.531
OK, I'm finally putting one
thing which is WWW.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16177-0
01:44:36.571 --> 01:44:37.411
All of them are wrong.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16190-0
01:44:38.961 --> 01:44:42.111
So now the question is that a
test tuple has come.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16205-0
01:44:42.541 --> 01:44:47.379
So now we have to see what is
the probability of all of them

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16205-1
01:44:47.379 --> 01:44:48.331
going wrong.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16216-0
01:44:48.581 --> 01:44:52.561
So now we have to say what is
the probability of?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16221-0
01:44:56.061 --> 01:44:56.821
Ensemble.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16226-0
01:44:59.471 --> 01:45:00.801
Doing going wrong.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16237-0
01:45:04.011 --> 01:45:05.881
So that can happen with this
case.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16251-0
01:45:05.931 --> 01:45:09.021
All of them are wrong or it can
happen with this case.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16275-0
01:45:09.031 --> 01:45:12.327
Two of them are wrong or it this
case two of them are wrong and

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16275-1
01:45:12.327 --> 01:45:14.181
in this case two of them are
wrong.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16288-0
01:45:14.271 --> 01:45:17.141
So what is the probability of
all of them going wrong?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16308-0
01:45:17.191 --> 01:45:24.471
It is .2 * .2 * .2 and two of
them were going wrong.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16337-0
01:45:24.741 --> 01:45:30.097
It is two of them are going
wrong .2 square multiplied by .8

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16337-1
01:45:30.097 --> 01:45:34.311
and this can happen at in happen
in three ways.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16351-0
01:45:34.721 --> 01:45:39.771
So the probability of ensemble
going wrong is .008.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16376-0
01:45:40.291 --> 01:45:52.397
Plus, let's this is point G04
multiplied by this is 2.4, so

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16376-1
01:45:52.397 --> 01:45:56.231
that is 0.008 plus.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16389-0
01:45:58.381 --> 01:46:03.541
0.096 right.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16394-0
01:46:04.071 --> 01:46:06.341
So that is equal to 0 point.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16418-0
01:46:07.891 --> 01:46:15.931
104 so the 20% error rate came
down to 10.4% error rate.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16420-0
01:46:16.851 --> 01:46:17.371
Is this clear?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16428-0
01:46:22.011 --> 01:46:22.591
Understood, Sir.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16430-0
01:46:23.681 --> 01:46:24.771
OK, OK. Alright.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16479-0
01:46:24.961 --> 01:46:29.820
So previously we had used 25 so
it is not possible to explain

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16479-1
01:46:29.820 --> 01:46:34.915
all the numbers, but we three we
could see that it is very clear

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16479-2
01:46:34.915 --> 01:46:39.695
and so you can think of why and
symbol is giving us a better

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16479-3
01:46:39.695 --> 01:46:40.401
accuracy.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16484-0
01:46:41.521 --> 01:46:42.261
No, no.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16493-0
01:46:42.271 --> 01:46:44.611
Let us go to the next problem.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16521-0
01:46:45.641 --> 01:46:50.218
Now suppose that there are, but
then we had taken a very

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16521-1
01:46:50.218 --> 01:46:55.036
convenient situation where all
the classifiers have got the

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16521-2
01:46:55.036 --> 01:46:56.321
same error rate.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16548-0
01:46:57.631 --> 01:47:02.743
Now, now let us think of a
situation where, again, we are

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16548-1
01:47:02.743 --> 01:47:08.473
looking at the we are looking at
an ensemble consisting of three

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16548-2
01:47:08.473 --> 01:47:09.531
classifiers.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16560-0
01:47:10.721 --> 01:47:12.941
So this has a 5% error rate.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16578-0
01:47:14.221 --> 01:47:20.791
Classifier 2 got 15% error rate,
classified 3 got 20% error rate.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16584-0
01:47:21.221 --> 01:47:22.191
What is going to happen?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16600-0
01:47:22.201 --> 01:47:26.206
We build a classifier ensemble
and say that go with majority

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16600-1
01:47:26.206 --> 01:47:26.731
working.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16609-0
01:47:37.711 --> 01:47:38.771
Somebody wants to make a guess.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16619-0
01:47:43.061 --> 01:47:43.861
Is the question clear?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16629-0
01:47:45.421 --> 01:47:47.761
In somebody's confirmed that the
question is clear.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16650-0
01:47:49.611 --> 01:47:53.951
Uh, yes, I thought the 5% one
would be the ohh optimal.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16652-0
01:47:54.471 --> 01:47:54.941
No, no.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16660-0
01:47:54.951 --> 01:47:56.841
We suppose that we got three.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16675-0
01:47:56.851 --> 01:47:59.885
We built 3 classifiers because
we have many, many methods to

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16675-1
01:47:59.885 --> 01:48:00.781
build classifiers.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16682-0
01:48:00.791 --> 01:48:02.781
So we build 3 independent
classifiers somehow.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16700-0
01:48:03.721 --> 01:48:07.203
Now the question is that suppose
the accuracy of three of them is

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16700-1
01:48:07.203 --> 01:48:07.731
different.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16708-0
01:48:08.281 --> 01:48:10.761
So then what will be the
ensembles accuracy?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16725-0
01:48:14.801 --> 01:48:15.881
Average of three, Sir.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16727-0
01:48:14.921 --> 01:48:16.131
Like depletion of the three.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16730-0
01:48:17.111 --> 01:48:18.011
Average of the three.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16736-0
01:48:18.021 --> 01:48:19.381
OK, now let us see.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16742-0
01:48:19.431 --> 01:48:19.961
Let us see.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16753-0
01:48:19.971 --> 01:48:21.371
Somebody has guessed it as an.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16755-0
01:48:20.981 --> 01:48:22.311
Better than all the three.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16771-0
01:48:23.781 --> 01:48:27.101
Uh, no, miss GURSIMRAN, what is
the answer?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16786-0
01:48:27.921 --> 01:48:30.301
Should I believe it will be
better than all of three?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16789-0
01:48:31.111 --> 01:48:32.391
It is better than all of three.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16794-0
01:48:32.401 --> 01:48:33.641
OK, OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16808-0
01:48:33.691 --> 01:48:39.161
So so now, now let me let me let
us do the calculation.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16815-0
01:48:39.231 --> 01:48:41.671
So then maybe it will help.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16871-0
01:48:42.571 --> 01:48:47.431
So so again, we want the
majority of them have to be,

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16871-1
01:48:47.431 --> 01:48:53.101
right, so majority are wrong is
error right majority of error,

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16871-2
01:48:53.101 --> 01:48:58.861
all of them them going wrong is
I hope you will agree .05 * .15

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16871-3
01:48:58.861 --> 01:49:01.471
* .2 all of them going wrong.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16894-0
01:49:02.511 --> 01:49:09.378
Other one is that .952 of them
are going wrong is .95 + .15 +

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16894-1
01:49:09.378 --> 01:49:09.821
.20.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16910-0
01:49:11.851 --> 01:49:15.991
Then another way two of them can
go wrong is .05.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16916-0
01:49:25.701 --> 01:49:27.021
Key there is some problem.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16932-0
01:49:39.081 --> 01:49:41.971
Sir, we are calculating
combination of all right.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16946-0
01:49:41.981 --> 01:49:43.251
Like Pass Pass failed.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16948-0
01:49:42.601 --> 01:49:44.801
Yes, yes, because we what is the
other option we have.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16949-0
01:49:45.801 --> 01:49:46.061
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16957-0
01:49:48.841 --> 01:49:50.261
Somebody wants to do the
calculation.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/16982-0
01:49:52.521 --> 01:49:59.841
So the numbers are simple 2015
300.03 so .03 and point.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17004-0
01:49:59.971 --> 01:50:03.357
So this is actually we need to
remove the all we have to

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17004-1
01:50:03.357 --> 01:50:06.031
multiply it by 10 to the power
of minus six.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17021-0
01:50:06.401 --> 01:50:11.051
So we are getting 5, 2015, 300
so it is 900 right?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17025-0
01:50:11.321 --> 01:50:11.831
No, no.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17032-0
01:50:12.121 --> 01:50:13.501
1500, right. OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17072-0
01:50:13.131 --> 01:50:20.918
So shouldn't there be one more
summation where in like you know

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17072-1
01:50:20.918 --> 01:50:24.811
.95 * .85 * .80 sort of a thing.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17070-0
01:50:24.511 --> 01:50:25.601
No, in that case.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17081-0
01:50:25.641 --> 01:50:27.621
See in that case all of them are
right.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17092-0
01:50:27.631 --> 01:50:29.381
So we are going to get the
correct answer right.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17105-0
01:50:29.431 --> 01:50:31.161
We are getting calculating the
error rate.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17122-0
01:50:30.101 --> 01:50:33.781
Uh, OK, welcome. OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17113-0
01:50:31.391 --> 01:50:32.801
We are calculating only error
rate.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17115-0
01:50:33.171 --> 01:50:33.501
Yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17145-0
01:50:33.511 --> 01:50:46.681
OK, so this is 300 * .95, so 285
right 285 and then the 00 OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17155-0
01:50:51.491 --> 01:50:52.881
Less so.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17170-0
01:50:52.891 --> 01:50:59.561
This is 100 * 85, so 8500 right?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17211-0
01:51:07.261 --> 01:51:15.521
Then this is 75 * 80 + 606,000,
so you can add them up 6015

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17211-1
01:51:15.521 --> 01:51:21.441
hundred, 85,000 is 10,016
thousand 44,500.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17224-0
01:51:25.091 --> 01:51:28.671
Multiplied by 10 to the power of
minus six. Right?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17231-0
01:51:29.201 --> 01:51:31.811
So this is equal to 0 point.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17233-0
01:51:33.501 --> 01:51:34.171
0.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17240-0
01:51:37.131 --> 01:51:38.591
445.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17253-0
01:51:45.161 --> 01:51:47.531
Alright, so so far so good.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17256-0
01:51:47.661 --> 01:51:48.611
So far so good.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17265-0
01:51:48.681 --> 01:51:51.471
So now I'm changing this to 3%.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17268-0
01:51:53.771 --> 01:51:54.221
Right.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17279-0
01:51:54.731 --> 01:51:57.311
And then you verify what will
happen to the ensemble.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17302-0
01:52:04.991 --> 01:52:11.257
So once you change that to 3%,
So what will happen is that this

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17302-1
01:52:11.257 --> 01:52:13.901
will become equal to three.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17309-0
01:52:13.961 --> 01:52:15.501
So this will become equal to.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17312-0
01:52:17.341 --> 01:52:18.161
900.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17332-0
01:52:20.271 --> 01:52:29.951
And then this is 97 uh, then 97
means 29101 hundred.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17344-0
01:52:32.751 --> 01:52:36.081
Then this is again .03.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17368-0
01:52:37.031 --> 01:52:45.831
So uh, so 85 into .6 is 4851.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17385-0
01:52:49.641 --> 01:52:54.471
Then this is 1200, so this is
3600.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17392-0
01:52:56.131 --> 01:52:58.171
So this will be equal to 900.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17414-0
01:52:58.181 --> 01:53:07.421
This is 30,000 thirty 8700, so
this is 0.0387.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17429-0
01:53:09.071 --> 01:53:12.314
So the ensemble error rate is
more than the error rate of the

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17429-1
01:53:12.314 --> 01:53:12.471
C1.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17434-0
01:53:16.531 --> 01:53:16.991
Is it clear?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17447-0
01:53:21.471 --> 01:53:23.351
This is 10 to the power of minus
six is there?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17452-0
01:53:32.891 --> 01:53:33.581
Is that clear?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17489-0
01:53:33.891 --> 01:53:38.168
So if we got a very good single
classifier and we bring it

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17489-1
01:53:38.168 --> 01:53:42.663
together with some not so good
classifiers and clean build an

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17489-2
01:53:42.663 --> 01:53:46.071
ensemble, it is going to corrupt
the good one.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17499-0
01:53:53.011 --> 01:53:55.871
Are we In Sync or have I lost
somewhere?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17514-0
01:54:00.271 --> 01:54:02.521
Everybody's quite is, is, is
this understood?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17537-0
01:54:02.891 --> 01:54:06.011
If, as long as all the ensemble
members are more.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17533-0
01:54:03.961 --> 01:54:04.231
It.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17534-0
01:54:04.711 --> 01:54:06.551
This calculation we got it, Sir.
Yes, Sir.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17539-0
01:54:06.591 --> 01:54:06.991
How are you?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17549-0
01:54:08.761 --> 01:54:09.881
I I can you repeat?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17552-0
01:54:10.581 --> 01:54:11.391
Yeah, we got this.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17559-0
01:54:11.401 --> 01:54:12.991
I at least I got this
calculation.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17575-0
01:54:13.001 --> 01:54:13.451
What you did?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17597-0
01:54:13.461 --> 01:54:17.598
I mean, we're just trying to
find out like how you finding

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17579-0
01:54:13.861 --> 01:54:14.261
Yeah, yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17590-0
01:54:17.191 --> 01:54:17.511
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17597-1
01:54:17.598 --> 01:54:19.211
out the error rate for?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17598-0
01:54:20.181 --> 01:54:20.551
No, no.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17649-0
01:54:20.561 --> 01:54:24.742
There is no formula, but the
concept is that when we are

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17614-0
01:54:24.161 --> 01:54:24.391
Umm.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17649-1
01:54:24.742 --> 01:54:29.437
creating an ensemble and suppose
that few of them are very good

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17649-2
01:54:29.437 --> 01:54:34.133
and some of them are average or
very bad, then we can't hope to

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17649-3
01:54:34.133 --> 01:54:37.801
create an ensemble that is
superior to individual

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17649-4
01:54:37.801 --> 01:54:38.681
classifiers.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17674-0
01:54:39.551 --> 01:54:43.834
But then if all of them are
equally bad or equally averaged,

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17674-1
01:54:43.834 --> 01:54:46.081
then we can create a better one.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17681-0
01:54:46.491 --> 01:54:47.931
If they are independent of each
other.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17680-0
01:54:46.841 --> 01:54:47.051
Umm.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17722-0
01:54:53.091 --> 01:54:57.374
Yes, like for the second
example, like if you observe the

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17696-0
01:54:54.481 --> 01:54:54.721
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17722-1
01:54:57.374 --> 01:55:01.732
3% the other we are getting
three more than three percent.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17731-0
01:55:00.881 --> 01:55:03.901
Three nearly four percent, 4%
for ensemble.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17722-2
01:55:01.732 --> 01:55:02.101
1387.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17727-0
01:55:02.551 --> 01:55:02.961
Yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17737-0
01:55:02.971 --> 01:55:04.651
Yep, you know.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17735-0
01:55:04.201 --> 01:55:04.931
So.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17754-0
01:55:05.001 --> 01:55:08.855
So then The thing is that
essentially C2 and C3 brought

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17754-1
01:55:08.855 --> 01:55:09.681
down the C1.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17767-0
01:55:10.711 --> 01:55:14.699
So so now now the people have a
different interpretations for

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17767-1
01:55:14.699 --> 01:55:15.021
this.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17781-0
01:55:15.301 --> 01:55:18.101
So they may say that C1 is
really an overfit.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17821-0
01:55:18.111 --> 01:55:22.208
That may be one possibility, or
it is possible that there so

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17821-1
01:55:22.208 --> 01:55:26.104
people say that random forest,
in spite of it even random

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17821-2
01:55:26.104 --> 01:55:30.201
forest works better because it
is a superior generalization.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17828-0
01:55:30.211 --> 01:55:31.351
That is what some people go
with.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17855-0
01:55:32.121 --> 01:55:34.918
So ensembles do a better
generalization, but then the

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17855-1
01:55:34.918 --> 01:55:38.129
interpretations differ, but the
mathematics will work only to

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17855-2
01:55:38.129 --> 01:55:38.751
some extent.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17860-0
01:55:38.761 --> 01:55:40.611
Other after that it is becoming
heuristic.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17871-0
01:55:46.391 --> 01:55:49.241
OK, so the next topic is model
evaluation.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17875-0
01:55:50.331 --> 01:55:51.261
So.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17884-0
01:55:51.351 --> 01:55:54.101
So I hope so far I things are
clear.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17899-0
01:55:54.111 --> 01:55:55.451
So we'll proceed to the next
topic.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17913-0
01:55:55.861 --> 01:55:59.861
So just to doubt, so in the
previous it is in it.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17930-0
01:55:59.871 --> 01:56:02.282
I mean, it is very essential
that the classification

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17930-1
01:56:02.282 --> 01:56:04.511
techniques are independent to
each other, right?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17959-0
01:56:04.601 --> 01:56:09.839
So, is there any statistical way
to say I mean to prove that it

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17959-1
01:56:09.839 --> 01:56:14.341
is independent so that we can
follow this ensemble or?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17973-0
01:56:14.961 --> 01:56:20.541
No, actually actually if if you
get a million records, everybody

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17973-1
01:56:20.541 --> 01:56:22.001
becomes helpless.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/17977-0
01:56:22.561 --> 01:56:23.231
So.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18005-0
01:56:23.241 --> 01:56:29.959
So The thing is that if you have
a way of see the point that I

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18005-1
01:56:29.959 --> 01:56:36.571
think I told you a friend is
that the idea of explainable AI?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18024-0
01:56:44.671 --> 01:56:50.321
Explainable AI is where you can
do a good interpretation, right?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18046-0
01:56:54.431 --> 01:56:59.351
So in such cases, based on your
intuition, you can see that it

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18046-1
01:56:59.351 --> 01:57:00.601
is working fine.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18078-0
01:57:01.251 --> 01:57:04.411
Otherwise, what you may have to
do is that given a data set, you

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18078-1
01:57:04.411 --> 01:57:07.231
are going to see for each
classifier, what are the things

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18078-2
01:57:07.231 --> 01:57:08.301
that it misclassified.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18098-0
01:57:08.751 --> 01:57:12.093
So if the if every classifier is
misclassifying the same thing,

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18098-1
01:57:12.093 --> 01:57:12.981
you combine them.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18105-0
01:57:12.991 --> 01:57:14.241
You are going to get no
advantage.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18122-0
01:57:16.731 --> 01:57:18.091
Is that clear, Mr Pranam?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18117-0
01:57:18.531 --> 01:57:18.821
Yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18129-0
01:57:18.831 --> 01:57:19.541
Yeah, it's clear.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18132-0
01:57:19.461 --> 01:57:20.591
You asked the question right?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18138-0
01:57:19.551 --> 01:57:21.241
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18136-0
01:57:20.601 --> 01:57:20.991
Yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18163-0
01:57:21.041 --> 01:57:24.476
So so there is really nothing
like if there is a formula, then

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18147-0
01:57:21.431 --> 01:57:21.821
Thank you.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18163-1
01:57:24.476 --> 01:57:27.311
possibly we will not study
independent classifiers.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18186-0
01:57:27.321 --> 01:57:31.129
So we say that, OK, start
building the ensemble, but there

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18186-1
01:57:31.129 --> 01:57:35.131
is really, really there are no
mathematics, don't work there.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18197-0
01:57:35.861 --> 01:57:41.041
And so we we go with the and
people like using.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18231-0
01:57:42.931 --> 01:57:46.316
Many times the random forest
instead of 1 tree they built

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18231-1
01:57:46.316 --> 01:57:49.759
many trees and then random
forest use the random forest to

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18231-2
01:57:49.759 --> 01:57:51.451
get somewhat better and than.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18253-0
01:57:53.581 --> 01:57:57.055
So that that depends on
essentially random forest means

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18253-1
01:57:57.055 --> 01:57:59.351
it selects the subset of
attributes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18275-0
01:57:59.361 --> 01:58:02.411
So if you have a large number of
set attributes and then you

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18275-1
01:58:02.411 --> 01:58:05.261
think all of them are useful,
then that can work better.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18278-0
01:58:06.941 --> 01:58:07.331
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18281-0
01:58:07.381 --> 01:58:07.991
Yeah. OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18283-0
01:58:08.081 --> 01:58:08.241
Yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18286-0
01:58:08.251 --> 01:58:08.711
Thank you, Sir.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18291-0
01:58:12.941 --> 01:58:13.431
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18300-0
01:58:13.441 --> 01:58:16.151
So we will look at how to
evaluate a model.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18304-0
01:58:17.101 --> 01:58:17.891
So.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18316-0
01:58:17.961 --> 01:58:20.883
So The thing is that so far we
have been talking about

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18316-1
01:58:20.883 --> 01:58:21.361
accuracy.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18328-0
01:58:24.041 --> 01:58:26.711
But then accuracy is a single
major.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18331-0
01:58:26.761 --> 01:58:27.491
Is that all?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18386-0
01:58:27.501 --> 01:58:31.986
So we will think about better
methods, so and also the

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18386-1
01:58:31.986 --> 01:58:37.043
question is that we generally
end up with a training data set

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18386-2
01:58:37.043 --> 01:58:41.936
and then from the training
dataset, how can we get estimate

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18386-3
01:58:41.936 --> 01:58:46.992
the accuracy that is better than
simply calculating the error

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18386-4
01:58:46.992 --> 01:58:49.031
correct and wrong tuples?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18431-0
01:58:49.581 --> 01:58:53.563
So is there a way so there are
some methods of how to improve

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18431-1
01:58:53.563 --> 01:58:57.610
the it's timation of accuracy
and then finally we look at some

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18431-2
01:58:57.610 --> 01:59:00.501
of the Roc curves that we see
how they work.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18445-0
01:59:01.111 --> 01:59:05.123
So so we create for classifier
what is known as a confusion

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18445-1
01:59:05.123 --> 01:59:05.591
matrix.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18451-0
01:59:08.671 --> 01:59:09.861
Confusion matrix.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18473-0
01:59:09.911 --> 01:59:13.928
Is that suppose there are two
classes, so we call one as C1

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18473-1
01:59:13.928 --> 01:59:15.401
and other as a not C1.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18493-0
01:59:15.691 --> 01:59:18.502
So this is we can call this as a
positive and negative or

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18493-1
01:59:18.502 --> 01:59:19.471
whatever we take it.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18509-0
01:59:19.951 --> 01:59:24.711
So what we do is that we plot a
cross tabulation.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18528-0
01:59:25.171 --> 01:59:28.684
Suppose that from the training
data set, we already know the

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18528-1
01:59:28.684 --> 01:59:31.161
actual class, so this is the
actual class.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18538-0
01:59:34.531 --> 01:59:36.211
And these are predicted classes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18549-0
01:59:38.091 --> 01:59:40.271
So this we referred as true
positives.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18569-0
01:59:41.751 --> 01:59:44.874
So this we call it as a false
negative because it is predicted

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18569-1
01:59:44.874 --> 01:59:46.411
as a negative, but it is false.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18574-0
01:59:47.971 --> 01:59:49.361
This is false positive.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18585-0
01:59:49.371 --> 01:59:51.921
This is predicted as positive,
but it is false.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18605-0
01:59:52.441 --> 01:59:56.361
This is predicted as negative,
but it is true and it is true.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18608-0
01:59:56.441 --> 01:59:57.361
It is true negative.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18633-0
01:59:57.851 --> 02:00:03.240
So we use that to compute the
accuracy is accuracy is true

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18633-1
02:00:03.240 --> 02:00:08.811
positive +2 negatives divided by
the total test data, right?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18651-0
02:00:11.001 --> 02:00:12.911
Uh, so we can compute the
accuracy.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18665-0
02:00:14.191 --> 02:00:18.971
And so can you go back to back
that slide once later?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18664-0
02:00:17.871 --> 02:00:18.011
Yes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18691-0
02:00:23.181 --> 02:00:26.679
Sir, what does it mean that true
positive, false positive, false

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18677-0
02:00:23.321 --> 02:00:23.461
Yes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18691-1
02:00:26.679 --> 02:00:27.971
negative, true negative?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18711-0
02:00:28.841 --> 02:00:31.790
That is just these are the
numbers that you can get because

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18711-1
02:00:31.790 --> 02:00:34.051
you have the training data that
is available.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18726-0
02:00:34.061 --> 02:00:37.218
So you know the actual class and
you have a classifier, so you

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18726-1
02:00:37.218 --> 02:00:38.571
can also predict the class.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18728-0
02:00:41.731 --> 02:00:42.051
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18739-0
02:00:47.101 --> 02:00:49.671
So in this case, what is the
accuracy?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18750-0
02:00:49.741 --> 02:00:51.551
Suppose that these are two
classes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18790-0
02:00:51.561 --> 02:00:55.867
Whether the person is going to
buy a gadget or not, and we have

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18790-1
02:00:55.867 --> 02:01:00.039
the actual classes that we know
there are 10,000 tuples so so

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18790-2
02:01:00.039 --> 02:01:02.731
the accuracy is this is a
correct data.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18799-0
02:01:02.791 --> 02:01:03.611
This is the correct thing.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18809-0
02:01:03.621 --> 02:01:07.113
This is correct prediction, but
these two are erroneous

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18809-1
02:01:07.113 --> 02:01:07.861
predictions.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18818-0
02:01:09.751 --> 02:01:11.381
So what is the accuracy?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18841-0
02:01:11.391 --> 02:01:19.691
So we are getting is 6954 plus
2/5 eight 8 / 10,000.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18854-0
02:01:21.211 --> 02:01:29.651
So that comes out to this
virtually .95 then this is.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18866-0
02:01:31.971 --> 02:01:35.171
12 You subtract from S4 to
right.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18875-0
02:01:42.291 --> 02:01:43.801
So this is the accuracy.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18902-0
02:01:43.811 --> 02:01:48.666
This is the way to measure the
accuracy, but but then we will

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18902-1
02:01:48.666 --> 02:01:52.111
go with the error rate is 1
minus accuracy.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18915-0
02:01:52.481 --> 02:01:57.451
So this is one, but we can have
other metrics that are useful.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18932-0
02:01:57.461 --> 02:02:01.907
Particularly, we have a data
where there is a one class is

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18932-1
02:02:01.907 --> 02:02:02.661
very rare.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18959-0
02:02:03.061 --> 02:02:06.701
So for example, we are talking
about a rare disease or a credit

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18959-1
02:02:06.701 --> 02:02:10.341
card fraud because credit card
companies, they receive millions

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18959-2
02:02:10.341 --> 02:02:11.251
of transactions.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18965-0
02:02:11.261 --> 02:02:12.271
Most of them are right.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18981-0
02:02:12.281 --> 02:02:15.661
Most of them are honest because
you know that you may be having

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/18981-1
02:02:15.661 --> 02:02:16.401
a credit card.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19008-0
02:02:16.651 --> 02:02:19.830
You may have had some example of
some fraud happening on your

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19008-1
02:02:19.830 --> 02:02:23.009
credit card, but then you may
have used credit card thousands

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19008-2
02:02:23.009 --> 02:02:23.881
of times already.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19025-0
02:02:24.351 --> 02:02:27.274
So one time it happens, so you
may remember it for a very, very

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19025-1
02:02:27.274 --> 02:02:27.731
long time.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19029-0
02:02:28.491 --> 02:02:28.981
So.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19036-0
02:02:28.991 --> 02:02:31.221
So the point is that the fraud
is wrong.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19059-0
02:02:31.671 --> 02:02:35.370
A fraud is rare, but then still
the credit card company needs to

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19059-1
02:02:35.370 --> 02:02:37.761
have a model to predict the
fraud, right?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19074-0
02:02:37.811 --> 02:02:40.921
So that they can still reduce
the frauds from hack occurring.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19103-0
02:02:41.451 --> 02:02:45.888
So this such when we try to
build the classifiers with such

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19103-1
02:02:45.888 --> 02:02:49.881
data, we say that we have a
class imbalance problems.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19116-0
02:02:50.431 --> 02:02:54.902
So instead of going for a simple
accuracy, we go for two other

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19116-1
02:02:54.902 --> 02:02:55.541
measures.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19124-0
02:02:55.551 --> 02:02:58.471
One is sensitivity and other is
specificity.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19146-0
02:03:00.161 --> 02:03:03.520
So sensitivity is talking about
the true positive recognition

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19146-1
02:03:03.520 --> 02:03:06.771
and specificity is talking about
true negative recognition.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19177-0
02:03:09.071 --> 02:03:16.203
And we also have a other metrics
such as precision but incision

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19177-1
02:03:16.203 --> 02:03:22.221
is telling that among the how
many of the tuples, uh.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19201-0
02:03:22.231 --> 02:03:26.269
So among the what suppose that
you predicted you build a

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19201-1
02:03:26.269 --> 02:03:29.741
classifier and then asked it to
make prediction.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19239-0
02:03:29.751 --> 02:03:33.113
It predicted that eighty of them
are positive but out of them

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19239-1
02:03:33.113 --> 02:03:36.041
actually only 60 are positive,
so remaining are false

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19239-2
02:03:36.041 --> 02:03:39.511
positives, so the negative ones
we got reported as a positives.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19269-0
02:03:39.761 --> 02:03:44.345
So in that case we my we
calculate what is known as a

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19269-1
02:03:44.345 --> 02:03:49.184
precision, which is a which is
suppose that we build, we

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19269-2
02:03:49.184 --> 02:03:52.071
construct the table, so which
is.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19294-0
02:03:55.341 --> 02:04:02.219
So true positives are 60 then
false positives are 20, then

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19294-1
02:04:02.219 --> 02:04:04.901
false negatives are 40.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19298-0
02:04:05.911 --> 02:04:07.351
Then this let us see.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19312-0
02:04:08.551 --> 02:04:11.561
So we are computing the
precision which is equal to.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19362-0
02:04:11.571 --> 02:04:17.114
In this case, in this case .75
be constricting the recall in

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19362-1
02:04:17.114 --> 02:04:22.656
this case, which is .6, and we
use an F metric, F major or F

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19362-2
02:04:22.656 --> 02:04:28.381
score, which is a combination or
a harmonic mean of these two.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19381-0
02:04:31.831 --> 02:04:36.521
So this can be one way in which
we can evaluate a classifier.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19393-0
02:04:38.021 --> 02:04:42.031
So I think, uh, I have few more
things to cover.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19419-0
02:04:42.081 --> 02:04:48.087
But you got me method of
evaluating the classifier so so

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19419-1
02:04:48.087 --> 02:04:55.041
we will stop here is that let me
take if there are any questions.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19432-0
02:04:56.261 --> 02:05:00.961
Uh, so, so we we have seen this
measure.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19446-0
02:05:00.971 --> 02:05:05.345
So we will look at little more
about evaluating the classifier

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19446-1
02:05:05.345 --> 02:05:05.901
further.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19453-0
02:05:15.891 --> 02:05:16.251
Sure, sure.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19454-0
02:05:17.421 --> 02:05:17.581
Yes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19469-0
02:05:19.331 --> 02:05:20.431
Maybe in next class, right?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19466-0
02:05:21.591 --> 02:05:21.881
No.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19474-0
02:05:21.891 --> 02:05:22.491
What is the question?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19477-0
02:05:23.301 --> 02:05:24.241
No, not not.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19497-0
02:05:24.301 --> 02:05:27.917
Not a question I'm saying we'll
take the next this in the next

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19497-1
02:05:27.917 --> 02:05:28.261
class.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19493-0
02:05:29.251 --> 02:05:29.581
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19495-0
02:05:29.591 --> 02:05:29.841
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19499-0
02:05:29.851 --> 02:05:30.461
OK, fine.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19521-0
02:05:30.441 --> 02:05:32.271
OK. Yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19502-0
02:05:30.471 --> 02:05:30.651
Yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19504-0
02:05:30.661 --> 02:05:30.961
Yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19510-0
02:05:31.031 --> 02:05:31.441
No, no.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19517-0
02:05:31.451 --> 02:05:33.121
That's what we are overrunning
the time.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19522-0
02:05:33.131 --> 02:05:33.701
So I'm.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19555-0
02:05:33.751 --> 02:05:37.717
I'm just there is something
which will take again some more

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19555-1
02:05:37.717 --> 02:05:41.551
time, so I'm just so we'll do
that next class is the last

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19555-2
02:05:41.551 --> 02:05:42.741
class before exam.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19616-0
02:05:43.421 --> 02:05:48.779
So we will do this and we will
also review the other all the

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19616-1
02:05:48.779 --> 02:05:54.225
topics we discussed till now and
and OK, next class is likely

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19616-2
02:05:54.225 --> 02:05:59.495
that we may have because the
your faculty of the algorithms

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19598-0
02:05:57.421 --> 02:05:57.631
Right.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19616-3
02:05:59.495 --> 02:06:04.765
class, did he inform you because
he has some next week some

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19616-4
02:06:04.765 --> 02:06:05.731
commitment.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19627-0
02:06:05.741 --> 02:06:08.221
So he wants me to take the
morning slot.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19653-0
02:06:08.501 --> 02:06:11.211
He will be able to, he informed
you.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19635-0
02:06:08.641 --> 02:06:09.281
Yes, Sir.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19655-0
02:06:09.911 --> 02:06:10.531
Yes. Yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19661-0
02:06:10.461 --> 02:06:11.711
Yeah, you wanted to swap.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19656-0
02:06:10.781 --> 02:06:11.321
He said.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19664-0
02:06:11.761 --> 02:06:12.161
Yes, Sir.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19659-0
02:06:12.821 --> 02:06:13.181
Yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19666-0
02:06:13.191 --> 02:06:13.661
OK, OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19681-0
02:06:13.671 --> 02:06:16.571
So that may that is a that is
going to happen.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19691-0
02:06:16.581 --> 02:06:18.441
So we'll meet at a different
time, OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19726-0
02:06:19.381 --> 02:06:23.481
So what kind of questions we can
expect out of these classifiers,

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19726-1
02:06:23.481 --> 02:06:25.221
and I'm going to will it be?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19729-0
02:06:24.301 --> 02:06:27.069
You may be given some data in
the US to build a classifier

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19729-1
02:06:27.069 --> 02:06:27.351
right?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19739-0
02:06:27.501 --> 02:06:28.651
That's a simplest thing.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19746-0
02:06:28.661 --> 02:06:29.721
Is it not expectation?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19750-0
02:06:29.761 --> 02:06:32.041
But there can be other variants
kind.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19758-0
02:06:36.081 --> 02:06:36.401
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19763-0
02:06:37.641 --> 02:06:39.741
Can you go to the presentation?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19765-0
02:06:40.961 --> 02:06:41.671
Presentation.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19771-0
02:06:41.681 --> 02:06:42.761
Yes, yes, I'm going there.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19780-0
02:06:43.581 --> 02:06:45.121
No, just give me one minute.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19789-0
02:06:48.661 --> 02:06:49.221
The P.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19793-0
02:06:49.841 --> 02:06:50.911
Yes, yes, I'm going there.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19795-0
02:06:52.661 --> 02:06:52.931
Yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19797-0
02:06:52.941 --> 02:06:53.161
Tell me.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19802-0
02:06:55.641 --> 02:06:56.451
Loading for me.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19810-0
02:07:00.041 --> 02:07:01.171
Yeah, two slides back.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19820-0
02:07:02.381 --> 02:07:03.901
Yeah, two slides back is this
one.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19829-0
02:07:05.321 --> 02:07:06.791
I think slide #36.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19828-0
02:07:05.701 --> 02:07:06.251
On this one.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19836-0
02:07:08.841 --> 02:07:10.171
OK, 36 OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19840-0
02:07:10.221 --> 02:07:11.521
Yeah, yeah, alright, good.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19844-0
02:07:13.471 --> 02:07:13.741
Yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19852-0
02:07:13.751 --> 02:07:15.261
Here you had put in the numbers.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19858-0
02:07:15.271 --> 02:07:16.501
Yeah, this how did you?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19883-0
02:07:18.141 --> 02:07:25.131
Choose a 6954 and 2588 and you
said like 46 and 412.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19887-0
02:07:25.571 --> 02:07:26.291
We can ignore.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19894-0
02:07:31.601 --> 02:07:32.591
I didn't get this part.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19897-0
02:07:36.661 --> 02:07:37.521
See.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19918-0
02:07:37.561 --> 02:07:41.753
See what we are saying is that
the the Whoever is selling the

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19918-1
02:07:41.753 --> 02:07:43.781
product has got the data with.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19958-0
02:07:46.121 --> 02:07:50.108
Offer they have actually got to
10,000 test records with the

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19958-1
02:07:50.108 --> 02:07:54.357
where the customers if they know
who bought and who did not buy,

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19958-2
02:07:54.357 --> 02:07:55.861
then you build a model.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19981-0
02:07:56.471 --> 02:07:59.861
And So what you know is that
707,000 people actually bought

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19981-1
02:07:59.861 --> 02:08:02.461
the computer, and 3000 people
did not buy it.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20002-0
02:08:03.911 --> 02:08:08.061
But your model is predicting
that out of them only 6954.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/19995-0
02:08:05.061 --> 02:08:05.411
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20011-0
02:08:08.071 --> 02:08:09.901
It could correctly predict 46.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20023-0
02:08:09.911 --> 02:08:10.651
It made the mistake.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20028-0
02:08:09.991 --> 02:08:12.981
Uh, so 46 cannot be the answer,
right?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20045-0
02:08:13.031 --> 02:08:13.821
Because there is a huge.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20076-0
02:08:13.251 --> 02:08:16.079
You know 46 is an incorrect
prediction from your model

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20064-0
02:08:15.761 --> 02:08:17.251
In oh.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20076-1
02:08:16.079 --> 02:08:19.215
because the model is not 100%
accurate because we will never

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20071-0
02:08:18.921 --> 02:08:19.241
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20076-2
02:08:19.215 --> 02:08:20.501
get 100% accurate models.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20086-0
02:08:20.771 --> 02:08:24.431
Unlikely to get one, so that is
what it happened.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20091-0
02:08:21.431 --> 02:08:21.731
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20130-0
02:08:24.441 --> 02:08:28.950
And then even with the wrong
side 3000 among 3000, it could

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20130-1
02:08:28.950 --> 02:08:33.234
get 2588 correct, but 412 it
predicted saying that these

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20130-2
02:08:33.234 --> 02:08:36.541
people will buy computer or by
the product.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20135-0
02:08:35.501 --> 02:08:35.801
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20148-0
02:08:36.591 --> 02:08:39.561
OK, so so that is, yeah, tell
me.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20144-0
02:08:37.591 --> 02:08:37.801
Yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20154-0
02:08:37.811 --> 02:08:41.831
So so if if you go 11 slide
back.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20159-0
02:08:42.691 --> 02:08:42.901
Hmm.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20165-0
02:08:44.461 --> 02:08:46.121
You had that false positive and.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20166-0
02:08:47.621 --> 02:08:47.781
Yes.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20174-0
02:08:52.721 --> 02:08:54.031
So this is the same thing.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20213-0
02:08:54.041 --> 02:08:58.288
So this is a true positive 6954
is true positive and 46646 is

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20213-1
02:08:58.288 --> 02:09:00.001
false positive and so on.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20214-0
02:09:00.361 --> 02:09:01.411
He has a true so.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20229-0
02:09:01.501 --> 02:09:05.041
So we picked the true positives
and true negatives here, right?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20237-0
02:09:05.941 --> 02:09:07.611
Yeah, yeah, true positives, true
negatives.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20241-0
02:09:07.621 --> 02:09:09.011
They represent the accuracy.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20245-0
02:09:09.021 --> 02:09:09.591
Yeah, right.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20266-0
02:09:09.641 --> 02:09:12.041
Other things or representing the
errors.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20254-0
02:09:09.881 --> 02:09:10.631
Accuracy.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20257-0
02:09:10.861 --> 02:09:11.391
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20282-0
02:09:11.501 --> 02:09:14.634
And and the accuracy formula is
that you showed in the next

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20282-1
02:09:14.634 --> 02:09:15.261
page, right?

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20277-0
02:09:15.751 --> 02:09:16.041
Yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20280-0
02:09:16.051 --> 02:09:16.501
Yeah, right.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20290-0
02:09:16.671 --> 02:09:17.271
Same thing, yeah.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20297-0
02:09:18.801 --> 02:09:19.721
And then the next page.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20302-0
02:09:20.841 --> 02:09:21.891
Yeah, this is the one right.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20324-0
02:09:22.401 --> 02:09:25.331
True positive plus true negative
by all accuracy.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20333-0
02:09:25.061 --> 02:09:28.406
Yes, yes, yes, yes, true
positive plus two negative

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20333-1
02:09:28.406 --> 02:09:29.371
divided by all.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20335-0
02:09:29.381 --> 02:09:29.951
OK.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20347-0
02:09:30.041 --> 02:09:31.651
Yeah, so this is what is
calculated there.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20354-0
02:09:31.661 --> 02:09:32.701
Fine, get it. Thanks.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20355-0

Yes, alright.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20374-0
02:09:36.401 --> 02:09:41.118
OK, so so now if there if there
are no questions, we'll close

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20374-1
02:09:41.118 --> 02:09:42.411
the session here.

27788ce7-720c-4136-98e6-517ba164afe9/20378-0
02:09:44.571 --> 02:09:44.891
