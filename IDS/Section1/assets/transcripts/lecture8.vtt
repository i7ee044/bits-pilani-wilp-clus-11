effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/51-0
00:00:21.737 --> 00:00:22.217
Good morning.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/82-0
00:00:25.577 --> 00:00:29.354
We were discussing about the
model evaluation, so we were

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/82-1
00:00:29.354 --> 00:00:33.196
middle in the middle of the
discussion and then we ran out

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/82-2
00:00:33.196 --> 00:00:33.977
of the time.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/90-0
00:00:33.987 --> 00:00:36.397
So we will continue the
discussion.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/95-0
00:00:38.237 --> 00:00:39.607
I hope. OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/115-0
00:00:39.617 --> 00:00:44.999
So you can all of you have been
unmuted so you feel free to

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/115-1
00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:48.317
interrupt if something is not
clear.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/128-0
00:00:54.407 --> 00:00:57.397
The so these are all the review
points.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/153-0
00:00:57.407 --> 00:01:04.308
So we had seen that we it's not
easy to think about the he

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/153-1
00:01:04.308 --> 00:01:12.027
accuracy metric without a proper
method to estimate the accuracy.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/199-0
00:01:13.497 --> 00:01:13.767
Uh.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/207-0
00:01:13.917 --> 00:01:19.753
The point is that when we build
the model, we build the model

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/207-1
00:01:19.753 --> 00:01:24.929
using the training data, but
then we will consider the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/207-2
00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:30.670
classifier as effective only if
it can work well with unseen

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/207-3
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.187
data, that is, tuples, which it
has never seen.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/213-0
00:01:36.737 --> 00:01:38.247
So there are methods.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/228-0
00:01:38.257 --> 00:01:42.650
So we had seen the definitions
for when it is a two class

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/228-1
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:43.937
confusion matrix.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/249-0
00:01:47.077 --> 00:01:50.298
He has seen that there can be
true positive false negatives,

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/249-1
00:01:50.298 --> 00:01:51.987
false positives, true negatives.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/267-0
00:01:52.217 --> 00:01:56.779
So this is representing the
actuals, the actual class, and

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/267-1
00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:59.407
then this is the predicted
class.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/293-0
00:02:02.987 --> 00:02:08.376
And so we have seen the example
of how to compute the these are

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/293-1
00:02:08.376 --> 00:02:13.427
the desirable things, and these
are the undesirable things.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/323-0
00:02:15.787 --> 00:02:20.861
So so when you are trying to
evaluate the the estimate the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/323-1
00:02:20.861 --> 00:02:24.817
accuracy, so you are going to
consider these.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/334-0
00:02:25.247 --> 00:02:29.187
So you are effectively making it
6954 plus.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/340-0
00:02:30.447 --> 00:02:32.167
Couldn't find 88.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/380-0
00:02:33.307 --> 00:02:38.306
These are these are the things
for which things have gone right

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/380-1
00:02:38.306 --> 00:02:43.305
out of the 10,000 cases, and we
have seen that the the accuracy

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/380-2
00:02:43.305 --> 00:02:46.897
and error rate, while we can
decide from the.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/398-0
00:02:48.437 --> 00:02:53.717
Are the cross tabulation of the
classifier results?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/407-0
00:02:54.797 --> 00:02:57.577
Uh, this is all also referred as
a confusion matrix.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/433-0
00:03:17.207 --> 00:03:21.332
And when we have unbalanced
classes, so we can may require

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/433-1
00:03:21.332 --> 00:03:25.107
additional measures like
sensitivity and specificity.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/457-0
00:03:27.147 --> 00:03:34.153
And we can have for example some
test cases where we will get 2

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/457-1
00:03:34.153 --> 00:03:37.437
positives which are desirable.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/464-0
00:03:37.447 --> 00:03:39.007
Suppose this is the important
class.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/470-0
00:03:40.097 --> 00:03:41.277
Uh, so.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/505-0
00:03:41.397 --> 00:03:46.406
So let it be something like for
example, we have done a search

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/505-1
00:03:46.406 --> 00:03:51.176
for something on one of these
search engines, so the search

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/505-2
00:03:51.176 --> 00:03:54.197
engine returned, let's say 200
pages.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/518-0
00:03:57.567 --> 00:04:02.507
And out of them, out of those
pages really.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/531-0
00:04:02.827 --> 00:04:07.167
So really 100, and let's say 100
are relevant.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/550-0
00:04:10.087 --> 00:04:14.655
And we somehow know that there
are actually in the web there

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/550-1
00:04:14.655 --> 00:04:16.377
are 150 relevant pages.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/563-0
00:04:20.397 --> 00:04:22.247
And the setting in return only
100.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/598-0
00:04:23.157 --> 00:04:29.053
So now what we can say is that
so the out of these 150 only 100

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/598-1
00:04:29.053 --> 00:04:34.304
have gone into the true
positives and other fifty became

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/598-2
00:04:34.304 --> 00:04:35.777
false positives.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/601-0
00:04:35.787 --> 00:04:36.727
Positives.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/606-0
00:04:37.427 --> 00:04:39.807
Sorry, so sorry, false
negatives.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/631-0
00:04:42.127 --> 00:04:47.233
And among these 200 pages that
are returned by the search

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/631-1
00:04:47.233 --> 00:04:51.897
engine, 100 are relevant and 100
or false positives.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/645-0
00:04:55.167 --> 00:04:57.357
OK, so they are not relevant,
but they are.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/675-0
00:04:57.427 --> 00:05:02.528
So, so we what we do is we
compute when 200 pages are

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/675-1
00:05:02.528 --> 00:05:06.117
returned and out of 100 are
relevant.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/732-0
00:05:06.127 --> 00:05:10.051
Then we call that as a precision
measure, 100 by 200, and when

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/732-1
00:05:10.051 --> 00:05:14.036
there are 150 relevant pages and
only hundred of them have been

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/732-2
00:05:14.036 --> 00:05:17.897
returned, we say that is about
the recall saying that 100 out

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/732-3
00:05:17.897 --> 00:05:21.197
of the 150 actual positive pages
have been returned.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/747-0
00:05:21.207 --> 00:05:25.950
Pages have been returned so we
can combine these two precision

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/747-1
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:26.777
and recall.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/764-0
00:05:27.317 --> 00:05:30.792
You get a school which is you
have school, which is a harmonic

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/764-1
00:05:30.792 --> 00:05:31.067
mean.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/784-0
00:05:36.607 --> 00:05:41.987
So we had this is this part we
had discussed in the last class.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/790-0
00:05:50.527 --> 00:05:50.997
Is it?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/801-0
00:05:51.007 --> 00:05:53.797
Is it a problem with the hearing
me?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/804-0
00:05:55.317 --> 00:05:55.657
Well, Sir.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/814-0
00:05:55.887 --> 00:06:01.767
Also OK, because I see some
someone.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/827-0
00:06:02.097 --> 00:06:05.801
OK, Miss Manisha, Ravi saying
that she's not able to hear

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/827-1
00:06:05.801 --> 00:06:06.247
anyone.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/845-0
00:06:06.757 --> 00:06:11.457
OK, I think you need to check
these speaker on your system.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/857-0
00:06:11.467 --> 00:06:13.937
Maybe she can't hear even this
message from me.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/865-0
00:06:22.467 --> 00:06:24.877
OK, so now my question.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/873-0
00:06:24.947 --> 00:06:27.097
OK, so now let us look at a
graph.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/893-0
00:06:29.437 --> 00:06:35.247
And here what we are saying is
that the recall is fixed at 70%.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/919-0
00:06:35.297 --> 00:06:39.525
So there is a classifier for
which recall is 70% and the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/919-1
00:06:39.525 --> 00:06:42.787
precision it changed based on
various ways.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/955-0
00:06:43.177 --> 00:06:48.466
The precision changes from 100
zero to 100 and then we compute

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/955-1
00:06:48.466 --> 00:06:53.670
a metric which is representing a
combination of precision and

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/955-2
00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:57.867
recall as the precision changes
from zero to 100.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/969-0
00:06:58.397 --> 00:07:02.667
So we have there are three
metrics that are used.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/975-0
00:07:03.337 --> 00:07:07.397
One is 1 is representing the.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/985-0
00:07:10.347 --> 00:07:11.557
Arithmetic mean right?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/992-0
00:07:13.337 --> 00:07:18.067
Athematic mean and another one
is representing.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1007-0
00:07:19.547 --> 00:07:24.717
Geometric mean and the another
one is representing harmonic

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1007-1
00:07:24.717 --> 00:07:25.147
mean.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1022-0
00:07:27.477 --> 00:07:32.127
So when you look at these three,
what is it that you gather?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1033-0
00:07:34.887 --> 00:07:35.707
Is the question clear?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1042-0
00:07:39.547 --> 00:07:40.387
Is the question clear?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1055-0
00:07:42.997 --> 00:07:43.927
Can you do better?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1056-0
00:07:43.567 --> 00:07:44.407
Cannot do it too.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1073-0
00:07:46.497 --> 00:07:48.997
Uh, yes, somebody speaking.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1091-0
00:07:50.327 --> 00:07:51.427
Can you repeat the question,
Sir?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1080-0
00:07:50.877 --> 00:07:51.927
Can you repeat the question?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1114-0
00:07:51.977 --> 00:07:56.018
Yes, yes, I'm going to repeat,
OK, I'm I'm not able to see who

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1093-0
00:07:52.447 --> 00:07:53.167
Yes, of course.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1114-1
00:07:56.018 --> 00:07:59.994
is speaking because I I don't
know, because the interface got

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1114-2
00:07:59.994 --> 00:08:00.507
changed.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1124-0
00:08:01.077 --> 00:08:01.677
It is not.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1132-0
00:08:03.317 --> 00:08:03.977
Or in them, Sir.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1133-0
00:08:03.837 --> 00:08:04.607
Find themselves.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1153-0
00:08:07.467 --> 00:08:11.307
Yes, music, burning them,
burning them.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1150-0
00:08:09.047 --> 00:08:09.487
Or in them.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1156-0
00:08:11.357 --> 00:08:11.787
OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1174-0
00:08:11.837 --> 00:08:15.274
Because generally what happens
is that the moment a person

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1174-1
00:08:15.274 --> 00:08:17.487
speaks, that icon comes to the
front.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1193-0
00:08:18.017 --> 00:08:24.181
So, OK, fine, now I'm because
this is a little latest release

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1193-1
00:08:24.181 --> 00:08:26.567
of teams from Microsoft.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1207-0
00:08:27.437 --> 00:08:30.867
Maybe, maybe some things that we
need to catch up with it.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1214-0
00:08:31.017 --> 00:08:32.887
OK, so fine Mr adding them.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1221-0
00:08:32.937 --> 00:08:35.627
So let me repeat the question.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1242-0
00:08:36.097 --> 00:08:40.327
So what we are saying is that we
want to create a metric which

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1242-1
00:08:40.327 --> 00:08:42.677
combines the precision and
recall.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1250-0
00:08:43.047 --> 00:08:45.547
So let's say there are three
options.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1285-0
00:08:45.607 --> 00:08:49.794
One is that you can combine them
as an arithmetic mean, and you

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1285-1
00:08:49.794 --> 00:08:53.915
can combine them as a geometric
mean, and you can combine them

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1285-2
00:08:53.915 --> 00:08:55.027
as harmonic mean.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1299-0
00:08:55.207 --> 00:08:57.943
A is arithmetic mean Gee is
geometric mean and which is

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1299-1
00:08:57.943 --> 00:08:58.627
harmonic mean.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1307-0
00:08:58.857 --> 00:09:00.647
So what is your observation?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1317-0
00:09:00.657 --> 00:09:03.517
From this graph, we are plotting
all three.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1352-0
00:09:04.647 --> 00:09:09.670
Mr Arindam is this clear now the
question is clear is yeah, OK,

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1332-0
00:09:09.327 --> 00:09:09.727
Yes, Sir.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1352-1
00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:14.614
because the precision and recall
can be combined and then they

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1352-2
00:09:14.614 --> 00:09:16.497
can take various values.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1370-0
00:09:16.507 --> 00:09:19.237
But for the simplicity for
plotting the graph, we fix it.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1410-0
00:09:19.247 --> 00:09:24.354
The recall and kept on varying
the precision, and then we

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1410-1
00:09:24.354 --> 00:09:29.812
plotted this as a graph saying
that what will be the harmonic

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1410-2
00:09:29.812 --> 00:09:34.037
mean as the precision changes
from zero to 100.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1438-0
00:09:34.047 --> 00:09:37.728
Similarly, what is the
arithmetic mean as it precision

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1438-1
00:09:37.728 --> 00:09:41.609
changes from zero to 100, So
what do you observe when you

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1438-2
00:09:41.609 --> 00:09:42.947
look at these three?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1460-0
00:09:49.527 --> 00:09:52.547
I'm hoping that you will get the
answer instead of my giving it.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1461-0
00:09:51.977 --> 00:09:52.937
They eventy percent.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1465-0
00:09:54.727 --> 00:09:55.417
OK, OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1467-0
00:09:55.427 --> 00:09:55.657
Yeah.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1472-0
00:09:55.667 --> 00:09:56.597
Yeah, please go ahead.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1477-0
00:09:56.687 --> 00:09:57.307
What is the question?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1501-0
00:09:58.637 --> 00:10:00.797
And it is not question, it's
heaven Divya sent.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1499-0
00:09:59.167 --> 00:10:00.177
And it is not question.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1527-0
00:10:00.847 --> 00:10:03.856
He was in the 70% recall is
fixed because otherwise the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1527-1
00:10:03.856 --> 00:10:05.897
graph will become a lot more
complex.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1558-0
00:10:05.907 --> 00:10:10.290
We need a 3D graph, so for that
what we did is that we fixed the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1558-1
00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:14.267
recall at 70% and changing only
precision versus a metric.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1564-0
00:10:14.397 --> 00:10:15.447
The metric can be anything.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1574-0
00:10:15.457 --> 00:10:18.654
Arithmetic mean, harmonic mean,
geometric mean, or even min or

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1574-1
00:10:18.654 --> 00:10:18.857
Max.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1579-0
00:10:20.737 --> 00:10:21.107
OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1598-0
00:10:21.117 --> 00:10:25.338
Mr SOUMYA has observed that it
is intersecting it 70 OK that is

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1598-1
00:10:25.338 --> 00:10:25.667
fine.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1612-0
00:10:25.917 --> 00:10:29.914
But when both of them are 70,
all the metrics are becoming 70

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1612-1
00:10:29.914 --> 00:10:30.107
OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1617-0
00:10:30.157 --> 00:10:31.487
So what else are you observing?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1644-0
00:10:34.107 --> 00:10:37.856
When both recall and precision,
or 70, then we are getting all

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1638-0
00:10:34.457 --> 00:10:36.127
Arithmetic mean is.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1644-1
00:10:37.856 --> 00:10:38.927
the metrics at 70.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1648-0
00:10:38.937 --> 00:10:39.867
Yeah, fine, no problem.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1664-0
00:10:41.807 --> 00:10:44.989
OK, arithmetic mean does not
start from zero, Mr Subroto Roy

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1664-1
00:10:44.989 --> 00:10:45.667
has observed.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1671-0
00:10:45.677 --> 00:10:46.887
OK, that is a good point.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1674-0
00:10:46.897 --> 00:10:47.067
Yeah.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1679-0
00:10:47.077 --> 00:10:48.047
What mode did you observe?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1689-0
00:10:52.037 --> 00:10:55.937
Yes, that is that is 1
observation, right? Good.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1701-0
00:10:58.787 --> 00:11:02.277
OK, Miss GURSIMRAN has a has an
interesting observation.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1714-0
00:11:02.347 --> 00:11:05.827
A is greater than G, is greater
than H So what does that mean?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1721-0
00:11:10.687 --> 00:11:11.307
You can speak.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1742-0
00:11:12.267 --> 00:11:16.217
I I I I hope the mic of
everybody is enabled.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1747-0
00:11:16.547 --> 00:11:18.017
He said it's enabled.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1753-0
00:11:17.067 --> 00:11:18.567
Yes, that's her name for it.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1767-0
00:11:18.147 --> 00:11:19.817
I just have an observation.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1764-0
00:11:18.767 --> 00:11:20.617
I just have an observation.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1781-0
00:11:20.667 --> 00:11:21.607
I don't know the meaning.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1774-0
00:11:20.827 --> 00:11:22.007
Yes, yes, that is good.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1778-0
00:11:22.147 --> 00:11:22.757
That is good.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1788-0
00:11:22.767 --> 00:11:24.517
A is greater than G is greater
than a.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1798-0
00:11:24.527 --> 00:11:26.897
That is, that is in fact the
answer.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1809-0
00:11:26.907 --> 00:11:29.077
One of the answers I'm looking
for what else?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1832-0
00:11:29.087 --> 00:11:31.237
I mean, what is the conclusion
you draw from that?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1839-0
00:11:34.057 --> 00:11:37.437
Because from harmonic mean only,
we get the defunct for.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1842-0
00:11:38.497 --> 00:11:39.927
Maybe you have to be louder.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1862-0
00:11:39.937 --> 00:11:43.233
Someone Mr Ranganathan is
speaking, but it is the voice is

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1872-0
00:11:42.747 --> 00:11:43.477
Harmonic.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1862-1
00:11:43.233 --> 00:11:43.847
coming low.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1879-0
00:11:43.857 --> 00:11:45.727
You come closer to the your
microphone and speak.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1916-0
00:11:44.637 --> 00:11:48.550
Not only, yeah, actually
harmonic mean will give this

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1888-0
00:11:47.057 --> 00:11:49.157
Yeah, harmonic to me.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1916-1
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:51.737
score between the recession and
we'll call.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1927-0
00:11:49.207 --> 00:11:52.038
But it give the temples were
Vicky direction and make

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1927-1
00:11:52.038 --> 00:11:52.457
project.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1952-0
00:11:52.627 --> 00:11:55.527
So that's why the harmonic made
is best parameter.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1940-0
00:11:53.237 --> 00:11:54.597
So that's why they had my.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1971-0
00:11:55.067 --> 00:11:58.506
OK, I think you are trying to
say is the harmonic mean is the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1971-1
00:11:58.506 --> 00:12:01.667
most conservative estimate,
which combines precision and

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1971-2
00:12:01.667 --> 00:12:02.997
recall, is that correct?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/1974-0
00:12:03.697 --> 00:12:03.837
Yes.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2012-0
00:12:04.747 --> 00:12:09.703
It is the most conservative uh
metric when you have been given

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2012-1
00:12:09.703 --> 00:12:14.265
the precision and recall, and
that is the reason possible

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2012-2
00:12:14.265 --> 00:12:18.434
reason why F score is built
using harmonic mean, not

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2012-3
00:12:18.434 --> 00:12:21.187
arithmetic mean or geometric
mean.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2040-0
00:12:21.717 --> 00:12:27.177
So so the so this way what we
are doing is we are taking the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2040-1
00:12:27.177 --> 00:12:32.457
so essentially what we are
saying is if score is equal to.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2058-0
00:12:45.417 --> 00:12:50.087
OK, so so that that will give
you the same, right?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2060-0
00:12:50.147 --> 00:12:50.927
Yeah, right.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2068-0
00:12:51.077 --> 00:12:53.227
So this is the harmonic mean.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2077-0
00:12:53.617 --> 00:12:55.057
OK, so it is understood.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2082-0
00:12:55.067 --> 00:12:57.287
Then you people got the answer.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2106-0
00:12:57.537 --> 00:13:02.846
So why we choose a metric of F
score rather than arithmetic

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2106-1
00:13:02.846 --> 00:13:06.827
mean to decide which is a better
classifier?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2115-0
00:13:13.657 --> 00:13:14.287
OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2118-0
00:13:14.027 --> 00:13:14.827
I just a quick.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2123-0
00:13:15.677 --> 00:13:16.877
Yes, Mr Rajesh, go ahead.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2126-0
00:13:18.147 --> 00:13:18.637
OK so.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2193-0
00:13:18.717 --> 00:13:25.411
OK, so 539 and I still have
tightly brown, but it's what

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2170-0
00:13:20.187 --> 00:13:24.726
Find that you know that these
two are tightly bone, but admin

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2170-1
00:13:24.726 --> 00:13:25.457
geometric.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2193-1
00:13:25.411 --> 00:13:27.877
does it signify this?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2183-0
00:13:25.457 --> 00:13:26.907
And what does it signify?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2187-0
00:13:29.027 --> 00:13:29.277
Why?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2198-0
00:13:29.287 --> 00:13:29.887
Why is it at?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2195-0
00:13:29.597 --> 00:13:29.847
Why?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2200-0
00:13:29.857 --> 00:13:30.237
Why is that?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2207-0
00:13:31.707 --> 00:13:32.327
Why is it?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2234-0
00:13:32.097 --> 00:13:36.357
Uh, what is harmonic mean title
method beyond the mathematical

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2238-0
00:13:34.117 --> 00:13:37.487
What is Harman method beyond the
mathematical patterns?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2234-1
00:13:36.357 --> 00:13:36.897
part of?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2244-0
00:13:38.857 --> 00:13:41.657
Ah, let's see.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2247-0
00:13:41.667 --> 00:13:42.507
There is nothing.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2260-0
00:13:42.517 --> 00:13:45.547
It's nothing is stopping us from
taking a geometric mean.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2268-0
00:13:45.987 --> 00:13:47.717
So you got precision and recall.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2343-0
00:13:47.727 --> 00:13:51.132
You say that you will use the
geometric mean of the two to

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2343-1
00:13:51.132 --> 00:13:54.709
qualify a classifier, because
finally we want to we can build

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2343-2
00:13:54.709 --> 00:13:58.286
many classifiers, so by now you
have already seen that we can

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2343-3
00:13:58.286 --> 00:14:01.864
build 2 classifiers and then if
you studied in the any of the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2343-4
00:14:01.864 --> 00:14:05.499
textbooks it says that OK it is
easily there are 10 methods to

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2343-5
00:14:05.499 --> 00:14:06.537
build classifiers.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2372-0
00:14:07.167 --> 00:14:10.005
So now the question is that each
of them will give different

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2372-1
00:14:10.005 --> 00:14:12.796
precision and recall and then
and you need to compare which

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2372-2
00:14:12.796 --> 00:14:13.447
one is better.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2384-0
00:14:13.797 --> 00:14:16.447
So to compare, it is better to
have single school.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2386-0
00:14:16.457 --> 00:14:17.287
Is that correct?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2410-0
00:14:17.387 --> 00:14:19.137
So then how to create that
single score?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2413-0
00:14:17.927 --> 00:14:20.877
That is, which one among these
like?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2445-0
00:14:21.037 --> 00:14:25.152
Just like of the decision that
you know Herman, you know

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2437-0
00:14:22.607 --> 00:14:24.847
The decision that you know
Harmonian is better.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2445-1
00:14:25.152 --> 00:14:25.657
better.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2461-0
00:14:25.777 --> 00:14:27.037
What does it signify?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2455-0
00:14:26.307 --> 00:14:27.617
What does it signify?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2479-0
00:14:27.147 --> 00:14:30.027
Like mathematically we see the
graph a bit higher.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2467-0
00:14:27.787 --> 00:14:28.097
Black.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2482-0
00:14:28.217 --> 00:14:30.677
Mathematically, will see the
graph a bit higher.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2486-0
00:14:30.177 --> 00:14:30.717
That is fine.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2491-0
00:14:30.787 --> 00:14:31.357
That is fine.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2499-0
00:14:31.647 --> 00:14:32.587
Umm.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2497-0
00:14:31.737 --> 00:14:33.707
Uh, but why is that happening?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2510-0
00:14:33.047 --> 00:14:34.357
But once that happening.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2522-0
00:14:33.717 --> 00:14:36.517
Is it because athletic for me
out there?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2562-0
00:14:34.407 --> 00:14:39.206
OK, OK, OK, Now, now, now, now
I'm seeing on most of the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2562-1
00:14:39.206 --> 00:14:43.920
authors are most of the
researchers like to compare the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2562-2
00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:49.055
F score, but then that does not
mean that you cannot use any

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2562-3
00:14:49.055 --> 00:14:51.327
other metric or we In Sync.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2569-0
00:14:53.607 --> 00:14:54.217
OK, fine.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2572-0
00:14:54.137 --> 00:14:54.757
OK, fine.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2595-0
00:14:54.227 --> 00:14:57.407
It's more of convention rather
than significant advance.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2614-0
00:14:54.767 --> 00:14:58.585
Let's what a finishing rather
than yeah, that is right,

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2614-1
00:14:58.585 --> 00:15:02.948
because most of the researchers
like to compare the performance

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2614-2
00:15:02.948 --> 00:15:04.447
using the F score and.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2612-0
00:15:03.567 --> 00:15:03.877
OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2633-0
00:15:04.487 --> 00:15:08.495
But then if you say that you
want to compare individually

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2633-1
00:15:08.495 --> 00:15:10.567
precision recall that is fine.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2679-0
00:15:10.677 --> 00:15:15.104
And then if you want to take the
arithmetic mean also, but then

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2679-1
00:15:15.104 --> 00:15:18.494
what we know is that the
harmonic mean is a more

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2679-2
00:15:18.494 --> 00:15:22.367
conservative because sometimes
we get metrics where the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2679-3
00:15:22.367 --> 00:15:25.687
precision, recall having widely
varying values.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2760-0
00:15:25.897 --> 00:15:30.878
For example, let us look at the
web example in the Web example I

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2760-1
00:15:30.878 --> 00:15:35.476
said 150 relevant page and out
of them 100 recalled 100 are

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2760-2
00:15:35.476 --> 00:15:40.227
there in the test results, but
in real web you know that when

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2760-3
00:15:40.227 --> 00:15:45.054
you are searching for, let us
say some something which is some

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2760-4
00:15:45.054 --> 00:15:50.035
something which is a kind of an
art or something which is a real

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2760-5
00:15:50.035 --> 00:15:51.107
kind of thing.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2777-0
00:15:51.477 --> 00:15:54.365
It is possible that there are
thousands of pages, but it is

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2777-1
00:15:54.365 --> 00:15:55.567
not able to capture them.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2793-0
00:15:56.177 --> 00:16:00.077
So it may be able to capture
only much many fewer number.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2818-0
00:16:01.257 --> 00:16:06.916
So they recall maybe far lower,
so only 10, while the precision

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2818-1
00:16:06.916 --> 00:16:10.187
may be, it may be going into
708090.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2830-0
00:16:10.597 --> 00:16:15.037
So now how do you know when you
have multiple sets?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2833-0
00:16:15.047 --> 00:16:15.347
Changes.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2867-0
00:16:15.357 --> 00:16:19.816
How will you compare them so so
The thing is that you need to

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2867-1
00:16:19.816 --> 00:16:24.418
combine the two because if you
go with only one maybe maybe you

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2867-2
00:16:24.418 --> 00:16:26.647
may not reach a ideal solution.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2874-0
00:16:29.287 --> 00:16:29.617
OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2876-0
00:16:29.667 --> 00:16:30.067
Makes sense.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2878-0
00:16:29.877 --> 00:16:30.267
OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2880-0
00:16:30.277 --> 00:16:30.627
Makes sense.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2882-0
00:16:31.347 --> 00:16:31.667
Thank you.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2883-0
00:16:31.917 --> 00:16:32.237
Thank you.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2894-0
00:16:37.177 --> 00:16:40.847
OK, let us let us go with the
further.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2917-0
00:16:41.017 --> 00:16:45.379
So it is also possible that you
want to give higher weightage to

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2917-1
00:16:45.379 --> 00:16:47.727
one of them compared to the
other.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2941-0
00:16:48.157 --> 00:16:53.979
So if we say that instead of
taking half and half, you want

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2941-1
00:16:53.979 --> 00:16:56.987
to take go with something else.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2968-0
00:16:56.997 --> 00:17:03.293
So what you say is that alpha is
equal to .75 and 1 minus alpha

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2968-1
00:17:03.293 --> 00:17:04.867
is equal to .25.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2990-0
00:17:04.977 --> 00:17:09.226
So there by what you are we are
saying is that we are giving a

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/2990-1
00:17:09.226 --> 00:17:12.327
differential credits to
precision and recall.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3057-0
00:17:12.777 --> 00:17:17.765
So in that case you will end up
with a different metric, so it

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3057-1
00:17:17.765 --> 00:17:22.595
is typically expressed in the
form of the beta square, which

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3057-2
00:17:22.595 --> 00:17:27.266
is equal to 1 minus alpha by
alpha, and that indicates the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3057-3
00:17:27.266 --> 00:17:32.333
ratio of importance that we want
to give to the two, and we end

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3057-4
00:17:32.333 --> 00:17:36.687
up with the YF beta score which
is expressed this way.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3074-0
00:17:39.877 --> 00:17:44.900
OK, now let us look at a
classifier is built, so a

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3074-1
00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:46.377
classifier for.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3078-0
00:17:52.257 --> 00:17:53.747
Medical diagnostics.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3111-0
00:17:58.027 --> 00:18:03.030
So you are looking at the
results of the classifier the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3111-1
00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:08.837
classifier has been used to test
a lot of data that's available.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3125-0
00:18:09.227 --> 00:18:12.815
So there are 10,000 cases or
available with some hospital and

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3125-1
00:18:12.815 --> 00:18:14.897
they have evaluated the
classifier.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3134-0
00:18:15.347 --> 00:18:17.207
So what do you think about this
classifier?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3141-0
00:18:29.577 --> 00:18:30.607
The accuracy is.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3158-0
00:18:34.657 --> 00:18:40.937
90 + 9560 is 9650 is 96.5%.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3174-0
00:18:43.067 --> 00:18:47.347
And what do you think about this
classifier on 96.4?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3189-0
00:18:47.577 --> 00:18:50.357
I don't know 96.5 that is what
it is coming to me.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3257-0
00:18:55.377 --> 00:19:00.079
So in this cancer equal to
critical to identify that even

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3252-0
00:18:55.987 --> 00:19:00.519
So in this cancer, will the
difficult to identify, even

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3257-1
00:19:00.079 --> 00:19:04.617
though it's only three point,
the wrongly added right a

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3252-1
00:19:00.519 --> 00:19:04.727
though it's only three uh
wrongly, I didn't. Right.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3257-2
00:19:04.617 --> 00:19:06.157
rightly identified.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3254-0
00:19:05.707 --> 00:19:05.857
Uh.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3259-0
00:19:05.867 --> 00:19:06.757
Rightly identified.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3262-0
00:19:07.817 --> 00:19:08.317
Umm.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3282-0
00:19:08.387 --> 00:19:14.029
Umm, OK OK, so So what do you
what do you say about the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3276-0
00:19:11.307 --> 00:19:11.777
Well, no.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3282-1
00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:15.137
classifier?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3314-0
00:19:18.167 --> 00:19:22.567
We probably are not happy with
it because the all.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3301-0
00:19:18.717 --> 00:19:20.787
The probably are not happy with
it.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3303-0
00:19:20.917 --> 00:19:21.557
OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3306-0
00:19:21.877 --> 00:19:22.377
OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3315-0
00:19:22.427 --> 00:19:24.067
OK, Mr Rajesh is not happy.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3317-0
00:19:24.117 --> 00:19:24.527
OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3327-0
00:19:24.537 --> 00:19:25.167
OK fine.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3329-0
00:19:25.537 --> 00:19:26.187
Except it.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3332-0
00:19:26.197 --> 00:19:28.377
And what are the comments from
anybody else?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3340-0
00:19:30.457 --> 00:19:31.777
Anyone has anything else to say?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3410-0
00:19:39.887 --> 00:19:46.220
OK, the the data we can see it
accuracy is 96.5 for when we are

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3414-0
00:19:40.327 --> 00:19:46.158
And with the data we can see it
accuracy is 96.5 for when we are

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3414-1
00:19:46.158 --> 00:19:51.720
checking the cancer is no for no
it is working perfect almost

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3410-1
00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:52.057
checking the cancer is no umm no
no it is working perfect.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3414-2
00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:52.437
perfect.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3416-0
00:19:52.457 --> 00:19:53.647
Almost perfect, right?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3418-0
00:19:53.657 --> 00:19:54.847
Right, right.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3432-0
00:19:55.397 --> 00:19:57.967
But then that is not important
for the domain, right?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3438-0
00:19:58.747 --> 00:19:59.037
Good.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3446-0
00:19:59.347 --> 00:20:02.807
And because we are talking about
a very serious disease.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3484-0
00:20:02.817 --> 00:20:07.374
So so we are we are concerned
about having a almost 100%

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3484-1
00:20:07.374 --> 00:20:12.250
recall even if something else
goes wrong, we just won't even

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3484-2
00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:15.447
if the precision is bad, we
don't mind.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3506-0
00:20:15.507 --> 00:20:20.381
But the recall has to be 100%
uh, so the sensitivity has to be

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3506-1
00:20:20.381 --> 00:20:20.767
100%.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3523-0
00:20:20.777 --> 00:20:26.309
We don't care about the other
metrics, so this is a this is a

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3523-1
00:20:26.309 --> 00:20:27.647
bad one, right?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3544-0
00:20:39.177 --> 00:20:45.014
OK, so now now let us look at
how can we evaluate a classifier

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3544-1
00:20:45.014 --> 00:20:45.847
accuracy.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3575-0
00:20:46.017 --> 00:20:51.021
So what we know is that we can
build, we know some algorithms

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3575-1
00:20:51.021 --> 00:20:56.268
to build classifier and we know
that there is a training data so

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3575-2
00:20:56.268 --> 00:20:57.397
training data.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3600-0
00:21:00.437 --> 00:21:06.272
And we want to, we want to use
the training data, let us say

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3600-1
00:21:06.272 --> 00:21:08.567
let us say we partition.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3613-0
00:21:08.837 --> 00:21:14.220
There are many people who have
talked about many percentages

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3613-1
00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:15.367
and all that.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3632-0
00:21:15.517 --> 00:21:20.047
So suppose this is the training
data that is given to you.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3637-0
00:21:20.277 --> 00:21:25.417
So you may use this for training
and this for testing.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3673-0
00:21:27.687 --> 00:21:33.320
And then then we are going to
let's say 2062 thirds is used

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3673-1
00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:39.327
for training and 1/3 is used for
testing and now what should be

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3673-2
00:21:39.327 --> 00:21:40.547
the accuracy?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3688-0
00:21:40.557 --> 00:21:43.787
How how do you want to evaluate
the accuracy of this classifier?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3717-0
00:21:47.287 --> 00:21:51.951
So the point is that yes, so you
may want to use the test set for

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3717-1
00:21:51.951 --> 00:21:55.767
deciding the accuracy or the
estimating the accuracy.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3723-0
00:21:56.287 --> 00:21:58.167
Do you think that is the ideal?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3747-0
00:22:00.607 --> 00:22:03.838
Using the test set to decide the
accuracy when you have a, you

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3747-1
00:22:03.838 --> 00:22:06.247
have kept the remaining part for
the training.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3760-0
00:22:09.287 --> 00:22:09.847
Sir if.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3765-0
00:22:09.557 --> 00:22:10.737
More vacation that thing.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3776-0
00:22:09.827 --> 00:22:10.687
It's not good morning.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3795-0
00:22:11.787 --> 00:22:13.847
Training data set is 2 third of
the model.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3819-0
00:22:12.367 --> 00:22:16.456
Banning dataset is 2 third of
the model, yes, so then that be

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3813-0
00:22:15.527 --> 00:22:18.117
Shouldn't that be used to
determine the accuracy?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3819-1
00:22:16.456 --> 00:22:18.697
useful to determine the
accuracy.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3822-0
00:22:18.227 --> 00:22:19.557
It's having a larger data.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3832-0
00:22:18.827 --> 00:22:23.787
It's having a larger data that
that is that is actually.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3870-0
00:22:23.857 --> 00:22:27.246
See, the point is that we have
every option because see, the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3870-1
00:22:27.246 --> 00:22:30.635
point is your company cannot
give you more than 1000 records

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3870-2
00:22:30.635 --> 00:22:33.967
to build the classifier because
that is all that they have.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3897-0
00:22:34.517 --> 00:22:37.644
So now you are concern is that
you want to build a classifier

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3897-1
00:22:37.644 --> 00:22:40.467
also to satisfy yourself that
you have done a good job.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3972-0
00:22:41.777 --> 00:22:45.973
So now what is the way in which
you can satisfy yourself that

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3972-1
00:22:45.973 --> 00:22:49.694
you are accuracy is is
reasonable or that you've got a

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3972-2
00:22:49.694 --> 00:22:53.822
reasonable estimate of your
accuracy because you can go with

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3972-3
00:22:53.822 --> 00:22:57.679
a belief that you have built
100% accuracy and then your

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3972-4
00:22:57.679 --> 00:23:01.807
customers may laugh because on
the first day it gave me gave

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3972-5
00:23:01.807 --> 00:23:04.107
them a result of some 60% or
50%.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3991-0
00:23:06.987 --> 00:23:07.727
Again my friend.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3994-0
00:23:07.307 --> 00:23:09.217
So now what is the day you can.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/3992-0
00:23:07.617 --> 00:23:08.357
We can give more.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4009-0
00:23:09.327 --> 00:23:11.707
Yeah, go ahead.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4024-0
00:23:11.717 --> 00:23:14.679
We can do more vacays to their
testing results, so that's

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4043-0
00:23:12.337 --> 00:23:16.291
We can do that testing results,
sending it in expected to

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4024-1
00:23:14.679 --> 00:23:15.087
failing.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4041-0
00:23:15.097 --> 00:23:17.337
It is expected to perform on the
training.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4043-1
00:23:16.291 --> 00:23:17.927
perform on the training.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4064-0
00:23:19.727 --> 00:23:21.447
So we can divide the training
data.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4075-0
00:23:20.337 --> 00:23:24.645
So we can divide the training,
OK, we can divide the training

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4075-1
00:23:24.645 --> 00:23:25.687
data into what?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4089-0
00:23:27.447 --> 00:23:27.797
Uh.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4118-0
00:23:27.807 --> 00:23:32.127
Into multiple chunk and base for
the but.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4094-0
00:23:28.047 --> 00:23:28.397
Uh.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4165-0
00:23:28.407 --> 00:23:33.318
Into multiple chunk and based
from yes, yes I I think the idea

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4165-1
00:23:33.318 --> 00:23:38.073
is coming out is good because
when you have taken let us say

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4165-2
00:23:38.073 --> 00:23:42.749
fixed 700 so thousand records
you got 660 you got them as a

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4165-3
00:23:42.749 --> 00:23:47.426
training set and then you build
the model and then you have

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4164-0
00:23:46.457 --> 00:23:47.067
So can you?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4165-4
00:23:47.426 --> 00:23:48.517
taken another.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4210-0
00:23:50.577 --> 00:23:54.525
340 as the test set and you
evaluate it, but then it is

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4207-0
00:23:54.047 --> 00:23:57.187
Sir, can we run the multiple
time that is data?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4210-1
00:23:54.525 --> 00:23:57.767
possible for the multiple times
that is data.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4228-0
00:23:58.697 --> 00:24:03.589
Yes, what you can do is that you
can also say that OK now I

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4228-1
00:24:03.589 --> 00:24:04.567
rotate that.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4263-0
00:24:05.017 --> 00:24:11.013
So what I will do is that
instead of sticking with a fixed

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4263-1
00:24:11.013 --> 00:24:17.516
training set and test set, I may
say that I'm going to use this

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4263-2
00:24:17.516 --> 00:24:18.227
as the.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4271-0
00:24:18.277 --> 00:24:19.997
This is I'm building a model.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4279-0
00:24:20.927 --> 00:24:22.777
Let's say I have built a model.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4309-0
00:24:23.047 --> 00:24:28.869
So you M so Y M1 is built like
this, but I can also try repeat

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4309-1
00:24:28.869 --> 00:24:32.657
this saying that I will build a
M2 with.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4327-0
00:24:34.287 --> 00:24:38.989
This says the test set and this
says the training set and see

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4327-1
00:24:38.989 --> 00:24:39.747
how is it?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4339-0
00:24:39.757 --> 00:24:41.937
How are you going to get the
result right?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4365-0
00:24:42.107 --> 00:24:46.345
So similarly you can try
multiple times, keep building

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4365-1
00:24:46.345 --> 00:24:51.352
the multiple models and then you
can get an idea of the approach

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4365-2
00:24:51.352 --> 00:24:52.507
you are taking.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4371-0
00:24:53.157 --> 00:24:54.637
How good is your approach?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4402-0
00:24:55.067 --> 00:24:59.278
Because this model is not going
to be ideal identical to what

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4402-1
00:24:59.278 --> 00:25:03.217
you built as a M1M2 and M1 are
not going to be identical.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4431-0
00:25:03.427 --> 00:25:07.887
But then it is possible that you
use the same algorithm, but then

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4431-1
00:25:07.887 --> 00:25:12.212
the algorithm will come out with
a different set of parameters,

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4431-2
00:25:12.212 --> 00:25:12.617
or so.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4485-0
00:25:12.707 --> 00:25:16.313
The point is, if you are
building rules, the rules can

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4485-1
00:25:16.313 --> 00:25:19.919
turn out to be slightly
different, but the sequence of

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4485-2
00:25:19.919 --> 00:25:23.853
the rules or the importance of
the rules may change, or the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4485-3
00:25:23.853 --> 00:25:27.590
because the they may get
different files, scores or some

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4485-4
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:29.687
other scores that you are using.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4522-0
00:25:30.197 --> 00:25:35.425
So the point is that but then it
says that you get an idea of

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4522-1
00:25:35.425 --> 00:25:40.821
what is it that kind of accuracy
you can get from this training

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4522-2
00:25:40.821 --> 00:25:43.687
data when you try multiple
times.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4532-0
00:25:46.357 --> 00:25:47.197
Sir, I have a question.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4538-0
00:25:46.407 --> 00:25:50.037
So this is uh, OK are we?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4552-0
00:25:52.357 --> 00:25:53.007
I said I have a.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4550-0
00:25:52.497 --> 00:25:53.537
Yes, that I will.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4561-0
00:25:54.467 --> 00:25:55.207
Yes, yes, go ahead.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4558-0
00:25:55.857 --> 00:25:56.517
Yeah.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4564-0
00:25:56.447 --> 00:25:56.837
Yeah.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4588-0
00:25:56.757 --> 00:26:00.587
So when we are partitioning the
data right one by three.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4589-0
00:25:57.187 --> 00:26:01.317
Also, when we impacting that
data right one by three?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4606-0
00:26:02.727 --> 00:26:03.107
Umm.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4618-0
00:26:03.947 --> 00:26:08.015
So basically a we consider the
fact that the population is not

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4614-0
00:26:04.607 --> 00:26:07.687
So basically people considering
the fact that.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4618-1
00:26:08.015 --> 00:26:09.887
too densely populated, right?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4628-0
00:26:10.067 --> 00:26:10.257
Right.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4655-0
00:26:10.247 --> 00:26:14.147
Let's say two by three of the
the they shouldn't have the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4644-0
00:26:10.887 --> 00:26:12.237
That's two by three of the.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4655-1
00:26:14.147 --> 00:26:17.037
entire, let's say one class and
the other.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4663-0
00:26:17.107 --> 00:26:19.527
Basically, they should not be
cured subsets, right?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4668-0
00:26:33.127 --> 00:26:33.357
Hello.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4683-0
00:26:55.407 --> 00:26:56.847
What are you talking on mute?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4709-0
00:27:00.247 --> 00:27:03.833
Yeah, that is correct, yes,
because what happened is I

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4709-1
00:27:03.833 --> 00:27:07.157
wanted to so previously people
said it is echoing.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4715-0
00:27:07.167 --> 00:27:08.307
So I put myself on mute.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4763-0
00:27:08.347 --> 00:27:13.274
OK, So what I'm saying is that,
uh, what I'm saying is that the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4763-1
00:27:13.274 --> 00:27:18.277
when it data is given to you, it
training data, you will believe

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4763-2
00:27:18.277 --> 00:27:23.203
that the entire training data is
as valuable as the one part as

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4763-3
00:27:23.203 --> 00:27:24.357
the other part.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4798-0
00:27:24.927 --> 00:27:29.680
So you have no basis for you to
really, unless you have a real

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4798-1
00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:34.508
domain expertise and you think
straight away that this data was

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4798-2
00:27:34.508 --> 00:27:37.977
really collected through a very
improper way.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4804-0
00:27:37.987 --> 00:27:40.027
And so that is invaluable.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4823-0
00:27:40.037 --> 00:27:44.156
Not valuable, but then otherwise
you have to depend on the entire

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4823-1
00:27:44.156 --> 00:27:44.467
data.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4861-0
00:27:44.537 --> 00:27:48.052
And because finally the data is
in set you want to use the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4861-1
00:27:48.052 --> 00:27:51.387
entire value of that are we In
Sync or uh, am I talking

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4861-2
00:27:51.387 --> 00:27:54.007
something different than what
you expected?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4865-0
00:27:54.927 --> 00:27:55.377
No, no.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4873-0
00:27:55.387 --> 00:27:56.207
I think we're going to you.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4875-0
00:27:55.507 --> 00:27:56.687
No, I didn't know what you.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4912-0
00:27:58.107 --> 00:28:02.311
So the point is how to make use
of the entire data, so the point

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4912-1
00:28:02.311 --> 00:28:05.998
is if you start with for
example, we have looked at only

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4912-2
00:28:05.998 --> 00:28:08.067
toy datasets, but we can always.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4939-0
00:28:08.467 --> 00:28:12.037
So when you've got 1000 records,
you know that if you use first

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4939-1
00:28:12.037 --> 00:28:14.937
600 records, you're going to get
a different model.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4945-0
00:28:14.947 --> 00:28:16.847
Then you use the last 600
records.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4969-0
00:28:17.817 --> 00:28:20.498
So now you use the same
algorithm, but since you change

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4969-1
00:28:20.498 --> 00:28:22.747
the data, you're going to get
different model.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4998-0
00:28:23.137 --> 00:28:28.167
So possible that can give you an
indication of the efficiency of

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/4998-1
00:28:28.167 --> 00:28:32.887
your algorithm, because you may
want to use both the models.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5004-0
00:28:32.897 --> 00:28:34.127
Or you may want to.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5008-0
00:28:34.177 --> 00:28:34.997
We will see.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5048-0
00:28:35.007 --> 00:28:38.145
You may want to build an
ensemble of both the models,

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5048-1
00:28:38.145 --> 00:28:41.747
that is a different thing, but
then that gives you an idea of

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5048-2
00:28:41.747 --> 00:28:45.407
what is the estimated accuracy
that you can get from the data.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5095-0
00:28:45.817 --> 00:28:49.504
So now finally, you may even go
for using the entire 1000

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5095-1
00:28:49.504 --> 00:28:53.254
records to build a new model,
because once you got an idea

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5095-2
00:28:53.254 --> 00:28:57.131
that OK, every time I try with
various subsets I'm getting a

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5095-3
00:28:57.131 --> 00:28:57.957
75% accuracy.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5098-0
00:28:58.527 --> 00:28:58.967
Fine.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5111-0
00:28:58.977 --> 00:29:01.437
Maybe I'll come in all of that
and 75% J.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5121-0
00:29:01.447 --> 00:29:03.537
Accuracy that your customer will
be happy with.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5147-0
00:29:03.907 --> 00:29:07.677
Maybe I will use the entire data
now and build a new model, but

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5147-1
00:29:07.677 --> 00:29:10.857
then R estimating the accuracy
is not a trivial task.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5155-0
00:29:10.867 --> 00:29:12.877
That is what I hope you
understood by now.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5174-0
00:29:17.287 --> 00:29:21.176
So one of the ways we can
estimate the accuracy is with

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5174-1
00:29:21.176 --> 00:29:23.537
the step called cross
validation.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5193-0
00:29:23.807 --> 00:29:28.309
So cross validation, what we are
saying is that it's essentially

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5193-1
00:29:28.309 --> 00:29:30.317
what we have been discussing.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5202-0
00:29:30.707 --> 00:29:33.997
So suppose that I have got go.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5211-0
00:29:34.607 --> 00:29:36.707
Let me create a 5 partitions.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5242-0
00:29:37.797 --> 00:29:45.727
So I call them as T1T2T3T4T5 and
then what I will do is that this

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5242-1
00:29:45.727 --> 00:29:46.567
is the.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5248-0
00:29:46.577 --> 00:29:48.567
Now I'm taking K is equal to 5.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5267-0
00:29:49.177 --> 00:29:55.107
So what I do is that I build
Model 1 so the test data is.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5270-0
00:29:55.607 --> 00:29:56.497
Guys.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5272-0
00:29:57.607 --> 00:29:57.867
Alright.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5286-0
00:30:00.827 --> 00:30:06.737
So Model 2 test data is T2, so
on.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5316-0
00:30:06.747 --> 00:30:11.602
So you build the five models and
then thereby you're going to get

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5316-1
00:30:11.602 --> 00:30:15.647
an idea of what is the
classifier accuracy through the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5316-2
00:30:15.647 --> 00:30:16.897
cross validation.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5357-0
00:30:17.227 --> 00:30:20.358
Because you have five models and
then you're looking at the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5357-1
00:30:20.358 --> 00:30:23.436
accuracy of each one and that
will give you an idea of the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5357-2
00:30:23.436 --> 00:30:26.461
overall accuracy of the model
when you build it using the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5357-3
00:30:26.461 --> 00:30:27.087
entire data.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5376-0
00:30:33.867 --> 00:30:39.630
OK, so there is another approach
that people suggest easy

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5376-1
00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:41.617
bootstrapping model.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5390-0
00:30:42.087 --> 00:30:45.077
So in bootstrapping model they
work.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5395-0
00:30:45.087 --> 00:30:46.017
It works like this.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5401-0
00:30:46.027 --> 00:30:48.997
Suppose that you have a.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5405-0
00:30:49.007 --> 00:30:51.277
You have 1000 training records.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5420-0
00:30:58.567 --> 00:31:02.607
And then what we do is that we
sample with replacement.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5435-0
00:31:04.497 --> 00:31:08.706
Sample the training data from
the training records with the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5435-1
00:31:08.706 --> 00:31:09.547
replacement.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5439-0
00:31:09.637 --> 00:31:10.507
So what?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5444-0
00:31:10.557 --> 00:31:12.127
What is the probability that?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5463-0
00:31:13.857 --> 00:31:20.557
One record is not selected, is 1
by one, 1 -, 1 by 1000, right?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5498-0
00:31:21.377 --> 00:31:25.995
So when you are selecting one
record from the 1000 records,

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5498-1
00:31:25.995 --> 00:31:30.074
the probability of it getting
selected is 1 by 1000,

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5498-2
00:31:30.074 --> 00:31:34.307
probability of not getting
selected is 1 -, 1 by 1000.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5528-0
00:31:35.077 --> 00:31:38.624
But now what we do is that let
us say we repeat the process

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5528-1
00:31:38.624 --> 00:31:42.347
1000 times, we have 1000 records
and we repeat the process for

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5528-2
00:31:42.347 --> 00:31:42.997
1000 times.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5543-0
00:31:44.417 --> 00:31:47.887
Uh, so that now what we did is
that we have 1000 records.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5560-0
00:31:47.897 --> 00:31:52.088
We have repeated the process, we
have kept on taking the samples

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5560-1
00:31:52.088 --> 00:31:53.377
without replacement.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5567-0
00:31:53.577 --> 00:31:56.247
Sorry with replacement 1000
times.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5573-0
00:31:56.437 --> 00:31:58.557
So we got 1000 training data.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5631-0
00:32:00.287 --> 00:32:04.649
And then after getting the
training data, what we do is

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5631-1
00:32:04.649 --> 00:32:09.634
that we are going to remove the
duplicates so that we are going

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5631-2
00:32:09.634 --> 00:32:14.307
to get the training data with
the without duplicates and we

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5631-3
00:32:14.307 --> 00:32:19.057
use that for for doing the uh,
what would be model building?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5642-0
00:32:19.487 --> 00:32:23.857
So now if you do this, how many
of the records?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5654-0
00:32:24.647 --> 00:32:27.877
So what is the value of this
approximately 1 -?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5664-0
00:32:27.887 --> 00:32:29.697
1 by 1000, to the power of 1000.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5672-0
00:32:30.367 --> 00:32:31.967
So what is the approximate value
of this?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5684-0
00:32:34.657 --> 00:32:35.557
Almost close to 1.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5691-0
00:32:35.217 --> 00:32:37.487
Almost close to 11 by E.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5701-0
00:32:37.617 --> 00:32:40.247
No, no, no, no, no one one
minus.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5696-0
00:32:37.837 --> 00:32:38.017
Or.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5723-0
00:32:40.537 --> 00:32:44.979
We have taken 1000 samples and
what we did is that each time we

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5723-1
00:32:44.979 --> 00:32:47.547
had taken a sample with
replacement.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5767-0
00:32:48.877 --> 00:32:53.775
So it record not getting
selected is approximately the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5767-1
00:32:53.775 --> 00:32:59.384
probability is 1 by East so that
is what we are saying is that

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5767-2
00:32:59.384 --> 00:33:02.767
that is approximately equal to
0.368.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5793-0
00:33:03.277 --> 00:33:08.907
So what we are saying is that if
we do this, we are going to get

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5793-1
00:33:08.907 --> 00:33:12.457
the test training data size will
be 632.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5809-0
00:33:18.917 --> 00:33:23.037
And the test data will be 368.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5823-0
00:33:23.667 --> 00:33:26.927
Is this is this clear or is it
confusing?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5845-0
00:33:28.097 --> 00:33:31.517
Sir, can you explain what do you
mean by with replacement?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5842-0
00:33:29.157 --> 00:33:29.477
That's.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5860-0
00:33:29.187 --> 00:33:33.019
Can you explain what you mean by
with replacement victory

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5860-1
00:33:33.019 --> 00:33:35.727
placement is that you have 1000
records.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5878-0
00:33:35.977 --> 00:33:40.615
You have taken training 1 sample
so you have not removed the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5866-0
00:33:36.767 --> 00:33:37.267
But they can.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5878-1
00:33:40.615 --> 00:33:41.147
sample.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5886-0
00:33:41.157 --> 00:33:42.897
You still keep the sample in the
data.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5892-0
00:33:44.217 --> 00:33:45.227
Removed the sample.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5914-0
00:33:45.517 --> 00:33:48.322
So now again, next time also you
go you have still have 1000

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5914-1
00:33:48.322 --> 00:33:50.207
records and you are taking a new
sample.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5925-0
00:33:53.467 --> 00:33:54.147
Random sample.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5920-0
00:33:54.287 --> 00:33:55.577
And OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5923-0
00:33:55.627 --> 00:33:55.857
OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5927-0
00:33:55.697 --> 00:33:56.107
OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5929-0
00:33:55.867 --> 00:33:56.187
Thank you.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5930-0
00:33:56.357 --> 00:33:56.757
Thank you.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5995-0
00:34:03.427 --> 00:34:09.812
Is this clear bootstrapping you
end up with 6632 training and

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5945-0
00:34:06.527 --> 00:34:06.787
Yeah.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5956-0
00:34:06.797 --> 00:34:07.317
Thank you too.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5995-1
00:34:09.812 --> 00:34:15.785
368 test and this may be the
reason why it motivates many

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5995-2
00:34:15.785 --> 00:34:22.170
researchers to say, take 60%
sixty five 6% as uh training and

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/5995-3
00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:23.817
the 33% as test.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6007-0
00:34:23.827 --> 00:34:27.257
But then it's a OK you you get
it.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6012-0
00:34:27.267 --> 00:34:28.297
Anyway, this is a.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6028-0
00:34:28.307 --> 00:34:32.322
This is doing a random sampling
and then what is the problem

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6028-1
00:34:32.322 --> 00:34:33.967
with the random sampling?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6048-0
00:34:43.167 --> 00:34:44.677
It can end up by us.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6049-0
00:34:43.727 --> 00:34:45.297
It can end up by.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6057-0
00:34:45.937 --> 00:34:46.657
That is right.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6098-0
00:34:46.667 --> 00:34:51.007
It it need not be stratified
because random sampling is is

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6098-1
00:34:51.007 --> 00:34:55.787
something which is when we have
we do not have a when you do not

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6098-2
00:34:55.787 --> 00:35:00.347
have a full idea about the data
then random sampling is good.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6151-0
00:35:00.857 --> 00:35:05.930
So that is to say, we are not
sure about the many class

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6151-1
00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:11.907
distribution or so, but then the
point is that random sampling is

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6151-2
00:35:11.907 --> 00:35:17.704
supposed to, for example, there
each attribute has got possible

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6151-3
00:35:17.704 --> 00:35:23.501
values and then we do not know
the importance of this attribute

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6151-4
00:35:23.501 --> 00:35:24.587
towards the.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6194-0
00:35:24.737 --> 00:35:29.483
So in that case, random sampling
is a good test case because it

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6194-1
00:35:29.483 --> 00:35:34.081
is a, it is going unbiased, but
then The thing is that we may

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6194-2
00:35:34.081 --> 00:35:38.604
have a knowledge about the data
that random sampling may not

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6194-3
00:35:38.604 --> 00:35:39.197
capture.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6247-0
00:35:39.957 --> 00:35:45.451
So for example we let's say we
are talking about a population

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6247-1
00:35:45.451 --> 00:35:51.299
which is where this is a I think
on the first day we had taken an

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6247-2
00:35:51.299 --> 00:35:56.526
example where a political
election where we have to depend

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6247-3
00:35:56.526 --> 00:35:59.627
on a sample to predict the
result.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6295-0
00:36:00.197 --> 00:36:03.859
So now the challenge is that
let's say the gender is a strong

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6295-1
00:36:03.859 --> 00:36:07.697
influencer, so that is possible
that female voters have a strong

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6295-2
00:36:07.697 --> 00:36:11.535
preference for certain party and
they male looters have a strong

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6295-3
00:36:11.535 --> 00:36:13.897
preference for another political
party.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6330-0
00:36:14.827 --> 00:36:19.062
So now now the point is that
that information, if you have

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6330-1
00:36:19.062 --> 00:36:23.583
that information then you will
make sure that both of them are

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6330-2
00:36:23.583 --> 00:36:26.597
represented proportionally in
the sample.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6344-0
00:36:27.287 --> 00:36:31.234
But then, if that information is
not there, random sample is

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6344-1
00:36:31.234 --> 00:36:31.557
fine.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6358-0
00:36:32.117 --> 00:36:34.876
But if this information is
there, then you would rather go

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6358-1
00:36:34.876 --> 00:36:35.997
for a stratified sample.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6362-0
00:36:36.527 --> 00:36:37.307
Are we In Sync?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6372-0
00:36:40.487 --> 00:36:42.007
Is is that uh making sense?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6376-0
00:36:43.737 --> 00:36:44.247
So.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6393-0
00:36:44.257 --> 00:36:48.317
So in that sense, random
sampling is not bad but and also

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6393-1
00:36:48.317 --> 00:36:50.557
random sampling can be unbiased.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6406-0
00:36:51.477 --> 00:36:55.467
But then but then there is,
there may be a useful knowledge.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6408-0
00:36:56.407 --> 00:36:56.977
Uh.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6427-0
00:36:56.987 --> 00:37:00.906
Such as which it can be used by
a stratified sampling and random

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6427-1
00:37:00.906 --> 00:37:03.377
sampling may not capture that
knowledge.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6438-0
00:37:08.147 --> 00:37:09.487
OK, I'm hoping that.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6445-0
00:37:09.817 --> 00:37:11.547
Yeah. Yeah, I'm not.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6449-0
00:37:10.787 --> 00:37:11.487
I won't doubt.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6452-0
00:37:11.837 --> 00:37:12.897
Yes, Mr SAURABH. Yeah.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6461-0
00:37:14.127 --> 00:37:15.907
Uh, that .32?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6462-0
00:37:14.967 --> 00:37:16.497
That .32.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6478-0
00:37:18.837 --> 00:37:19.347
In the past.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6473-0
00:37:19.297 --> 00:37:20.627
Can you repeat the point?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6480-0
00:37:20.717 --> 00:37:21.077
Can you?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6484-0
00:37:21.117 --> 00:37:21.867
Can you repeat it?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6496-0
00:37:21.917 --> 00:37:23.167
Your voice is a little lower.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6490-0
00:37:22.217 --> 00:37:22.377
Yeah.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6499-0
00:37:23.457 --> 00:37:24.307
Yeah, sorry.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6501-0
00:37:23.977 --> 00:37:24.387
Yeah.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6506-0
00:37:24.317 --> 00:37:25.437
There is something that.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6516-0
00:37:24.497 --> 00:37:29.067
Sorry, they commit to that 0.63.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6519-0
00:37:27.197 --> 00:37:28.317
0.63.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6543-0
00:37:29.357 --> 00:37:33.727
Yeah, 0.63 you want to know why
it is why it is 66, right?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6559-0
00:37:32.257 --> 00:37:35.197
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but
yeah.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6552-0
00:37:33.817 --> 00:37:34.667
Yeah, I can do that.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6556-0
00:37:34.677 --> 00:37:35.567
Yeah, right, right.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6578-0
00:37:35.677 --> 00:37:40.054
So suppose that the training
data is 1000 or it can be 10,000

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6578-1
00:37:40.054 --> 00:37:41.607
or it can be anything.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6590-0
00:37:41.757 --> 00:37:46.977
Suppose that training data is
something like the D records.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6610-0
00:37:48.227 --> 00:37:52.349
Uh, OK, so now let me let me let
me do actually calculation then

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6610-1
00:37:52.349 --> 00:37:53.997
maybe you will appreciate.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6618-0
00:37:54.397 --> 00:37:58.547
So suppose that I rise, I rise.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6620-0
00:37:58.557 --> 00:37:59.277
Uh.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6636-0
00:37:59.437 --> 00:38:07.527
1000 records is 0.999 raised to
the power of 1000.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6647-0
00:38:09.617 --> 00:38:11.367
He's equal to .367.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6672-0
00:38:11.497 --> 00:38:19.890
OK, so now I do another thing G
0.9999 raised to the power of

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6672-1
00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:20.837
10,000.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6680-0
00:38:22.597 --> 00:38:25.227
He is also equal to
approximately same.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6740-0
00:38:25.317 --> 00:38:31.000
You can see that when you have
an equation of this form, it

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6740-1
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:37.062
tends to a limiting value, which
is the definition of E so when

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6740-2
00:38:37.062 --> 00:38:42.744
limit D tends to Infinity, 1 -,
1 by D to the power of D is

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6740-3
00:38:42.744 --> 00:38:48.237
approximately equal to 0.367,
which is defined as one by.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6743-0
00:38:51.187 --> 00:38:52.947
So uh.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6752-0
00:38:55.097 --> 00:38:56.727
Mr SAURABH, does that answer?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6757-0
00:38:56.237 --> 00:38:56.667
Yeah.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6769-0
00:38:56.737 --> 00:38:58.607
Yeah, so.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6754-0
00:38:56.837 --> 00:38:57.287
Yeah.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6766-0
00:38:57.857 --> 00:38:59.407
OK, so this is the.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6793-0
00:38:59.417 --> 00:39:02.655
This is the definition of E that
has been very valuable in

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6793-1
00:39:02.655 --> 00:39:06.003
mathematics because you know
when differentiation that has a

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6793-2
00:39:06.003 --> 00:39:08.307
very specific behavior of the
polynomial.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6796-0
00:39:09.187 --> 00:39:09.867
Uh, yes.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6800-0
00:39:10.867 --> 00:39:12.357
Uh, OK, Mr Rajesh.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6820-0
00:39:16.027 --> 00:39:17.047
Okie Okie umm.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6812-0
00:39:16.567 --> 00:39:17.177
Maybe we can.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6836-0
00:39:17.057 --> 00:39:18.767
But even then I can take it off.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6844-0
00:39:17.187 --> 00:39:19.757
I can take it off and then there
is a bit lower.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6839-0
00:39:19.137 --> 00:39:19.527
Yeah.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6865-0
00:39:19.537 --> 00:39:23.212
OK, I I think I think I think I
think it is clear possibly

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6865-1
00:39:23.212 --> 00:39:26.762
intuitively it feels like much
smaller percentage of the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6865-2
00:39:26.762 --> 00:39:27.447
population.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6880-0
00:39:27.797 --> 00:39:31.217
So The thing is that yes, that
is what it looks like.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6899-0
00:39:31.227 --> 00:39:36.283
But then the because that is why
we choose sampling with

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6899-1
00:39:36.283 --> 00:39:37.347
replacement.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6941-0
00:39:37.837 --> 00:39:41.575
When you do a sampling with
replacement, even when you try

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6941-1
00:39:41.575 --> 00:39:44.996
many times, there is a
possibility that yeah, we even

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6941-2
00:39:44.996 --> 00:39:49.113
with a, the point is that we are
also doing trying to create the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6941-3
00:39:49.113 --> 00:39:52.027
sample of the same size as the
training data.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6990-0
00:39:52.437 --> 00:39:55.443
So you know that when the
training data is very big, the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6990-1
00:39:55.443 --> 00:39:58.553
probability of not getting
selected is very high each time

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6990-2
00:39:58.553 --> 00:40:01.770
and then when training data is
small then the probability of

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6990-3
00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:04.827
not getting it so in either case
it turns out to be same.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/6997-0
00:40:04.937 --> 00:40:08.847
OK, OK, so this is good.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7018-0
00:40:08.897 --> 00:40:12.716
So now let us go into another
aspect which is which is

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7018-1
00:40:12.716 --> 00:40:16.187
actually interesting concept
that is coming from.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7033-0
00:40:18.297 --> 00:40:22.480
Ohh which is coming from radio
characteristics receiver

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7033-1
00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:24.347
operating characteristic.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7053-0
00:40:24.477 --> 00:40:29.184
Suppose that we are sending a
music from one place to another

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7053-1
00:40:29.184 --> 00:40:31.917
place through a radio
transmission.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7100-0
00:40:32.417 --> 00:40:36.265
So what we know is that we want
to do a high fidelity

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7100-1
00:40:36.265 --> 00:40:40.539
transmission, so high fidelity
transmission typically means

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7100-2
00:40:40.539 --> 00:40:44.672
that you need to capture every
frequency from you need to

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7100-3
00:40:44.672 --> 00:40:49.017
capture every frequency from I
think 20 Hertz to 20 K Hertz.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7133-0
00:40:52.637 --> 00:40:58.161
And a typical hello, I think
it's sufficient if you capture

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7133-1
00:40:58.161 --> 00:41:03.408
from 300 to about 4K, it's
sufficient for a normal voice

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7133-2
00:41:03.408 --> 00:41:05.617
recognition, it is 3 as.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7146-0
00:41:07.717 --> 00:41:13.947
Now the point is that suppose
that you are transmitting the.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7165-0
00:41:14.097 --> 00:41:19.698
So now the question is, what is
the basis on which we do a

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7165-1
00:41:19.698 --> 00:41:20.647
filtering.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7177-0
00:41:21.157 --> 00:41:24.985
So we need to filter because
when we do a radio transmission

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7177-1
00:41:24.985 --> 00:41:25.487
happens.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7189-0
00:41:25.777 --> 00:41:28.167
What is the frequency at which
the noise operates?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7194-0
00:41:28.817 --> 00:41:30.607
Noise exists at all frequencies.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7203-0
00:41:41.037 --> 00:41:42.447
So what does that mean?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7216-0
00:41:42.997 --> 00:41:48.400
So you reduce the reduce the
signal bandwidth that you

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7216-1
00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:49.087
accept.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7228-0
00:41:49.217 --> 00:41:52.357
Essentially you are reducing
also the noise that you accept.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7262-0
00:41:53.437 --> 00:41:57.712
Is there a concept clear so the
more you want to get in the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7262-1
00:41:57.712 --> 00:42:01.774
signal fidelity you are
capturing your forced to capture

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7262-2
00:42:01.774 --> 00:42:03.697
more noise in the receiver.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7265-0
00:42:04.957 --> 00:42:05.747
Is that clear?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7288-0
00:42:05.837 --> 00:42:09.641
So the more fidelity you want,
you end up in a way capturing

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7288-1
00:42:09.641 --> 00:42:11.947
the more noise from the
environment.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7313-0
00:42:12.537 --> 00:42:17.167
But if you are satisfied with
the lesser fidelity, you maybe

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7313-1
00:42:17.167 --> 00:42:19.747
get end up with the lesser
noise.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7326-0
00:42:20.057 --> 00:42:22.607
So this is in fact a problem
with the classifier.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7371-0
00:42:23.057 --> 00:42:27.626
So we say that we want to have
an extremely high recall, but

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7371-1
00:42:27.626 --> 00:42:32.045
the moment we say that we want
to get 100% recall, that is

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7371-2
00:42:32.045 --> 00:42:36.240
possible only if you are
capturing the entire negatives

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7371-3
00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:38.037
also into the positives.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7393-0
00:42:38.987 --> 00:42:42.205
So now, now let us see, maybe we
we will take the classifier

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7393-1
00:42:42.205 --> 00:42:43.417
example as we go ahead.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7414-0
00:42:43.827 --> 00:42:46.808
So we want to we have two
elements, one is the true

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7414-1
00:42:46.808 --> 00:42:50.017
positive rate and the other is
the false positive rate.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7461-0
00:42:50.777 --> 00:42:55.872
So what we are saying is that we
want to capture all the true

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7461-1
00:42:55.872 --> 00:43:00.967
positives, so then that means
the reality is that if you want

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7461-2
00:43:00.967 --> 00:43:05.158
to capture all the true
positives, you also end up

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7461-3
00:43:05.158 --> 00:43:07.787
getting all the false positives.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7471-0
00:43:07.797 --> 00:43:09.027
So that is all the negatives.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7476-0
00:43:09.187 --> 00:43:10.347
Also into the false positive.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7516-0
00:43:10.917 --> 00:43:14.958
So the when you say 00, So what
we are saying is that we declare

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7516-1
00:43:14.958 --> 00:43:18.937
everything to be negative class,
then the true positive rate is

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7516-2
00:43:18.937 --> 00:43:22.667
zero, true negative rate, false
positive rate is also zero.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7535-0
00:43:23.497 --> 00:43:27.234
But then ideally we want true
positive rate to be one and

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7535-1
00:43:27.234 --> 00:43:29.037
false positive rate to be 0.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7538-0
00:43:29.967 --> 00:43:30.657
So.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7568-0
00:43:30.727 --> 00:43:35.150
So what happens is that when you
try a classifier with the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7568-1
00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:39.873
different parameters add you try
to increase the true positive

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7568-2
00:43:39.873 --> 00:43:40.247
rate.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7583-0
00:43:40.757 --> 00:43:46.395
The way it captures the false
positives is really representing

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7583-1
00:43:46.395 --> 00:43:47.647
the Roc curve.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7619-0
00:43:48.567 --> 00:43:52.464
The curve that red curve that
you are seeing, which is called

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7619-1
00:43:52.464 --> 00:43:56.486
Ormoc Curve and Blue Line which
is representing a diagonal line

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7619-2
00:43:56.486 --> 00:43:58.497
is indicating a random guessing.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7629-0
00:43:58.767 --> 00:44:01.677
A random guessing is when you
have a two class problem.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7641-0
00:44:01.687 --> 00:44:04.717
Random guessing will give you
50% times, right?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7644-0
00:44:04.797 --> 00:44:05.137
Right.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7664-0
00:44:05.727 --> 00:44:10.090
Because we have two equal
classes and we are just trying

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7664-1
00:44:10.090 --> 00:44:11.927
to do a random guess so.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7687-0
00:44:11.997 --> 00:44:16.398
So now what we are saying is
that the more the area under the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7687-1
00:44:16.398 --> 00:44:20.657
red line, we think that the
classifier is of superior type.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7705-0
00:44:25.447 --> 00:44:30.497
OK, so now now the point is that
Roc curve is possibly we can.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7724-0
00:44:31.967 --> 00:44:37.387
Uh understand with the help of a
visualization that is presented

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7724-1
00:44:37.387 --> 00:44:38.637
by some expert.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7739-0
00:44:39.247 --> 00:44:43.434
So now let us say this is
representing the data that we

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7739-1
00:44:43.434 --> 00:44:43.807
have.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7745-0
00:44:44.167 --> 00:44:45.107
There are two classes.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7751-0
00:44:46.257 --> 00:44:47.327
There are two classes.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7766-0
00:44:47.337 --> 00:44:50.529
One is representing positive
class red curve and then

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7766-1
00:44:50.529 --> 00:44:52.657
negative class which is blue
curve.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7773-0
00:44:53.017 --> 00:44:55.207
OK, so this is the distribution.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7794-0
00:44:55.577 --> 00:45:00.673
So now you we always know that
it is never possible to have a

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7794-1
00:45:00.673 --> 00:45:02.727
complete differentiation.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7802-0
00:45:03.057 --> 00:45:05.447
So that happens in all types of
fields.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7818-0
00:45:05.457 --> 00:45:08.362
For example, you want to say
whether who will buy a

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7818-1
00:45:08.362 --> 00:45:09.367
motorcycle or car.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7833-0
00:45:09.777 --> 00:45:13.787
You cannot put a income as let's
say, a differentiator.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7877-0
00:45:14.017 --> 00:45:17.775
So you will never get an income
accurate line saying that, OK,

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7877-1
00:45:17.775 --> 00:45:21.652
anybody below 75,000 income will
buy a mop the cycle and anybody

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7877-2
00:45:21.652 --> 00:45:25.410
with income greater than 75,000
would be a car that will never

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7877-3
00:45:25.410 --> 00:45:25.827
happen.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7915-0
00:45:25.837 --> 00:45:28.621
There may be somebody with
₹60,000 income will buy a car

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7915-1
00:45:28.621 --> 00:45:31.747
and there will be somebody with
an income of ₹1,00,000 who will

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7915-2
00:45:31.747 --> 00:45:32.577
buy a motorcycle.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7931-0
00:45:33.447 --> 00:45:37.320
So the classification problem in
real world is never going to be

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7931-1
00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:37.617
real.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7959-0
00:45:37.627 --> 00:45:41.549
World Data set is never going to
be a clean cut case where you

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7959-1
00:45:41.549 --> 00:45:45.407
can build a simple classifier
and the whole world will follow

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7959-2
00:45:45.407 --> 00:45:45.967
the rule.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7985-0
00:45:47.137 --> 00:45:50.840
Uh, so the point is there is
always going to be an overlap in

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7985-1
00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:53.587
spite of that, we want to build
a classifier.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7991-0
00:45:53.597 --> 00:45:55.567
That is the best possible.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/7997-0
00:45:55.957 --> 00:45:58.087
So now this is giving.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8021-0
00:45:58.137 --> 00:46:02.516
This is having a smaller
overlap, so that means the Roc

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8021-1
00:46:02.516 --> 00:46:07.207
curve that we are plotting will
have a large area under it.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8039-0
00:46:07.657 --> 00:46:11.933
But now let us say we have got a
data where there is a

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8039-1
00:46:11.933 --> 00:46:13.487
significant overlap.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8071-0
00:46:14.077 --> 00:46:18.599
Then, as we change the
threshold, you can see the RC

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8071-1
00:46:18.599 --> 00:46:24.144
curve that has got a much lower
area than one, and as we move it

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8071-2
00:46:24.144 --> 00:46:25.167
is changing.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8098-0
00:46:25.177 --> 00:46:28.797
We can keep changing the because
we are using single threshold so

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8098-1
00:46:28.797 --> 00:46:31.704
each time we change the
threshold we get a different

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8098-2
00:46:31.704 --> 00:46:32.307
classifier.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8116-0
00:46:32.317 --> 00:46:36.109
But then whether a threshold is
a good classifier or not that we

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8116-1
00:46:36.109 --> 00:46:36.867
are checking.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8140-0
00:46:37.517 --> 00:46:41.651
So as we move the threshold, we
are the this classifier point is

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8140-1
00:46:41.651 --> 00:46:45.657
moving from the false positive
versus the true positive point.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8195-0
00:46:47.147 --> 00:46:53.035
And now we can see that when the
data is this then it is simply

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8195-1
00:46:53.035 --> 00:46:58.187
is becoming a random guess
because we have got complete

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8195-2
00:46:58.187 --> 00:47:03.799
overlap of the positives and
negatives and so any point that

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8195-3
00:47:03.799 --> 00:47:07.847
you take is virtually giving you
the trend.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8199-0
00:47:07.857 --> 00:47:09.657
Online, does that uh?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8225-0
00:47:09.857 --> 00:47:14.803
Does that clarify the concept of
area under the curve, then false

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8225-1
00:47:14.803 --> 00:47:19.073
positive versus the true
positives and then the plotting

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8225-2
00:47:19.073 --> 00:47:20.047
of the curve?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8263-0
00:47:24.687 --> 00:47:29.188
So this is again the same
picture drawn in on this slide

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8263-1
00:47:29.188 --> 00:47:34.241
and this we can take a data set
which is essentially taken from

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8263-2
00:47:34.241 --> 00:47:35.267
the textbook.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8281-0
00:47:35.427 --> 00:47:39.072
So we are saying that there are
10 instances and then we want to

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8281-1
00:47:39.072 --> 00:47:40.137
build a classifier.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8319-0
00:47:40.147 --> 00:47:43.449
So there is only one way we can
build so that is we need to

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8319-1
00:47:43.449 --> 00:47:46.971
create a threshold above which
we call that as a positive class

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8319-2
00:47:46.971 --> 00:47:49.557
and below that we call it as a
negative class.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8333-0
00:47:49.787 --> 00:47:54.812
So we can start building the
various classifiers, and then we

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8333-1
00:47:54.812 --> 00:47:55.217
plot.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8347-0
00:47:55.917 --> 00:48:00.237
So the AOC curve that we got is
the red one.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8369-0
00:48:04.157 --> 00:48:09.544
So the point is that AOC curves
help you to compare various

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8369-1
00:48:09.544 --> 00:48:12.417
approaches to build classifiers.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8390-0
00:48:12.427 --> 00:48:15.920
So one model one is built using
one approach and Model 2 is

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8390-1
00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:17.607
built using another approach.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8409-0
00:48:17.997 --> 00:48:21.507
So it tells you that, which is
the one which is performing the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8409-1
00:48:21.507 --> 00:48:23.847
better based on the area under
the curve.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8417-0
00:48:33.377 --> 00:48:34.167
So what do we find?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8441-0
00:48:39.807 --> 00:48:43.753
OK, so now what we do is, uh,
that is what we wanted to

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8441-1
00:48:43.753 --> 00:48:45.937
discuss about model evaluation.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8458-0
00:48:46.547 --> 00:48:51.637
So now we're going to the new
topic, which is prediction.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8467-0
00:48:52.087 --> 00:48:53.267
So it's a small topic.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8506-0
00:48:53.277 --> 00:48:58.244
We are going to learn prediction
in detail again later using more

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8506-1
00:48:58.244 --> 00:49:02.081
complex methods in future
courses, so we will just

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8506-2
00:49:02.081 --> 00:49:06.069
introduce the prediction because
it is actually same

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8506-3
00:49:06.069 --> 00:49:08.777
classification with a minor
change.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8514-0
00:49:08.787 --> 00:49:10.637
So we just understand what is
prediction.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8518-0
00:49:11.207 --> 00:49:11.897
So.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8547-0
00:49:11.947 --> 00:49:15.855
So the prediction is that when
we are predicting a numerical

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8547-1
00:49:15.855 --> 00:49:19.954
value, classification is when we
are predicting a nominal value

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8547-2
00:49:19.954 --> 00:49:21.427
or a categorical value.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8570-0
00:49:22.337 --> 00:49:26.569
So the prediction is trying to
build a continuous valued

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8570-1
00:49:26.569 --> 00:49:29.687
function that is indicating what
is that.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8585-0
00:49:30.117 --> 00:49:34.385
So the there are many cases
where we want to get a

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8585-1
00:49:34.385 --> 00:49:36.727
continuous value prediction.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8623-0
00:49:37.197 --> 00:49:42.055
So this can be either with
respect to the profit sales

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8623-1
00:49:42.055 --> 00:49:45.587
house price, then temperature
distance.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8631-0
00:49:45.597 --> 00:49:49.656
Many, many of them are
continuous valued functions, so

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8631-1
00:49:49.656 --> 00:49:54.379
we want to make the prediction
based on many uh attributes that

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8631-2
00:49:54.379 --> 00:49:56.297
are determining its value.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8640-0
00:49:56.627 --> 00:49:59.477
So the technique that we use is
prediction.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8659-0
00:49:59.807 --> 00:50:03.586
The OK, the problem is called
prediction and the technique

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8659-1
00:50:03.586 --> 00:50:06.147
that we use is a regression
techniques.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8667-0
00:50:06.157 --> 00:50:07.957
So these are all called
regression techniques.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8691-0
00:50:11.917 --> 00:50:17.530
A regression is typically what
we do is that we have the target

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8691-1
00:50:17.530 --> 00:50:19.547
values which are known.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8718-0
00:50:19.557 --> 00:50:25.719
For example, we have been given
a data like this, so let us say

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8718-1
00:50:25.719 --> 00:50:31.207
the area of a House and the
quality of the neighborhood.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8729-0
00:50:33.627 --> 00:50:36.677
Neighborhood can be excellent or
good or average.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8755-0
00:50:36.687 --> 00:50:42.192
So now let us say uh, so I Ravi
is 1000 square foot and

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8755-1
00:50:42.192 --> 00:50:44.747
neighborhood is excellent.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8811-0
00:50:45.237 --> 00:50:53.071
Then the price, let me say in
millions, I'm putting this as a

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8811-1
00:50:53.071 --> 00:51:00.905
7,000,000 so area is 1200 and
then it is neighborhood is good

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8811-2
00:51:00.905 --> 00:51:07.855
and then this is 7.2 EDI is 1000
and this is a average

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8811-3
00:51:07.855 --> 00:51:09.497
neighborhood.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8877-0
00:51:10.247 --> 00:51:15.434
Then you're getting it for 5.5
million then so when you get a

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8877-1
00:51:15.434 --> 00:51:20.370
data like this, so we need to
think in terms of creating a

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8877-2
00:51:20.370 --> 00:51:25.306
model that will get the value
for a new house that you are

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8877-3
00:51:25.306 --> 00:51:29.656
seeing in a particular
neighborhood and you want to

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8877-4
00:51:29.656 --> 00:51:34.927
predict what should be the price
that you should be paying for

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8877-5
00:51:34.927 --> 00:51:35.177
it.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8892-0
00:51:42.047 --> 00:51:45.997
So based on this type of data,
we need to predict.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8928-0
00:51:46.107 --> 00:51:51.638
So the so here we can have many
attributes, some of them numeric

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8928-1
00:51:51.638 --> 00:51:56.572
and some of them are nominal,
and typically to build this

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8928-2
00:51:56.572 --> 00:52:01.252
model we require the all the
predictors or independent

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8928-3
00:52:01.252 --> 00:52:02.187
attributes.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8936-0
00:52:02.197 --> 00:52:04.647
So we need to somehow convert
them into numbers.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8948-0
00:52:06.397 --> 00:52:08.647
And and our.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8957-0
00:52:08.657 --> 00:52:12.207
Otherwise, we need to have a
different methods of.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8992-0
00:52:12.437 --> 00:52:15.177
We'll we'll look at if we don't
want to convert them into

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8992-1
00:52:15.177 --> 00:52:18.059
numbers, what we have to do is
we'll look at them in a short

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/8992-2
00:52:18.059 --> 00:52:18.247
way.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9014-0
00:52:18.757 --> 00:52:25.007
So the point is that we this
regression can go into multiple

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9014-1
00:52:25.007 --> 00:52:29.207
ways, so one needs we can have a
linear.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9021-0
00:52:33.777 --> 00:52:36.647
Can be linear or nonlinear.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9030-0
00:52:39.747 --> 00:52:41.157
It can be regression.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9032-0
00:52:41.167 --> 00:52:42.417
Can also be simple.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9037-0
00:52:44.887 --> 00:52:47.017
So one independent variable.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9040-0
00:52:53.167 --> 00:52:53.867
Odd multiple.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9048-0
00:52:57.317 --> 00:53:00.927
So we mini independent
variables.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9099-0
00:53:05.527 --> 00:53:09.511
And it is also possible that
sometimes we end up with other

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9099-1
00:53:09.511 --> 00:53:13.760
models where we see that some of
the variable we have to take a

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9099-2
00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:17.677
log of that to get this and
regression 3 is that we cannot

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9099-3
00:53:17.677 --> 00:53:20.067
find a linear easy linear
solution.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9121-0
00:53:20.077 --> 00:53:24.436
Then we start going in for a
purely nonlinear solution and

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9121-1
00:53:24.436 --> 00:53:28.277
based on many attributes that we
start considering.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9132-0
00:53:28.967 --> 00:53:35.117
So let's see how does a
integration work with the?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9144-0
00:53:38.227 --> 00:53:38.807
Thank you, Sir.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9165-0
00:53:38.457 --> 00:53:41.137
Ohh and then you go on like
that.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9159-0
00:53:38.817 --> 00:53:40.827
Will you go once like I have?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9168-0
00:53:40.877 --> 00:53:41.937
Sorry, I was nothing.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9180-0
00:53:41.617 --> 00:53:46.697
Yeah, uh, yes, not in.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9187-0
00:53:45.557 --> 00:53:46.667
Today I'm gonna study.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9210-0
00:53:46.947 --> 00:53:49.857
Yes, Mr SAURABH, can you can you
repeat the question, go back to

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9207-0
00:53:49.697 --> 00:53:50.367
Let me go to.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9210-1
00:53:49.857 --> 00:53:50.707
the previous slide.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9214-0
00:53:51.297 --> 00:53:51.697
Yeah, yeah.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9221-0
00:53:51.877 --> 00:53:55.727
Yeah, go back to the previous
slide, this slide, right.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9227-0
00:53:59.867 --> 00:54:00.597
This slide right?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9230-0
00:54:00.017 --> 00:54:02.367
Uh, no.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9245-0
00:54:02.377 --> 00:54:03.327
Uh, #6.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9236-0
00:54:02.557 --> 00:54:02.917
No.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9249-0
00:54:02.927 --> 00:54:06.167
Uh #6 with the one before this.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9257-0
00:54:06.797 --> 00:54:07.567
OK, this one.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9262-0
00:54:06.997 --> 00:54:07.967
Numbers that.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9259-0
00:54:08.277 --> 00:54:08.747
This one?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9263-0
00:54:08.757 --> 00:54:09.587
Yeah, OK. Yeah.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9268-0
00:54:10.877 --> 00:54:12.777
It's OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9273-0
00:54:11.427 --> 00:54:13.927
This book book event.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9277-0
00:54:12.817 --> 00:54:13.237
OK then.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9275-0
00:54:14.217 --> 00:54:14.567
Yeah.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9301-0
00:54:14.607 --> 00:54:19.496
OK, so now now what we are
saying is that regression can

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9301-1
00:54:19.496 --> 00:54:24.127
take the find form of equation
which looks like this.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9311-0
00:54:24.317 --> 00:54:27.667
Suppose that we have got
predictor variables.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9314-0
00:54:27.877 --> 00:54:29.217
So many predictor variables?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9343-0
00:54:30.257 --> 00:54:36.997
Uh, let's say these are all the
predictors X1 to XN, and then we

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9343-1
00:54:36.997 --> 00:54:41.247
want to build a model to for the
target.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9345-0
00:54:41.257 --> 00:54:42.027
Why?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9372-0
00:54:42.677 --> 00:54:46.804
Which is single variable then
what we can do is that we can

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9372-1
00:54:46.804 --> 00:54:51.137
write this equation where W is
representing set of parameters.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9387-0
00:54:52.147 --> 00:54:56.537
So these parameters can be in
case of a linear regression.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9395-0
00:54:56.867 --> 00:54:59.297
So we are going to get.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9412-0
00:54:59.467 --> 00:55:03.939
So for example, there are yen
predictors, so we require N + 1

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9412-1
00:55:03.939 --> 00:55:05.237
parameters, right?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9437-0
00:55:07.487 --> 00:55:11.437
Because it's a linear, so we can
only have a multiplier, the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9437-1
00:55:11.437 --> 00:55:14.997
coefficient, and then we meet,
we can have one offset.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9454-0
00:55:19.757 --> 00:55:24.227
So so that can be that is one
way of looking at it.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9472-0
00:55:24.237 --> 00:55:27.445
If we are doing a linear, but if
it is a nonlinear, we may have

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9472-1
00:55:27.445 --> 00:55:28.497
many more parameters.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9521-0
00:55:30.107 --> 00:55:35.739
And and the way we can do it is
that we will, when we build the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9521-1
00:55:35.739 --> 00:55:41.458
model, the model is represented
by the function F So what we get

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9521-2
00:55:41.458 --> 00:55:47.002
is that we will seldom get the
model that exactly matches with

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9521-3
00:55:47.002 --> 00:55:48.057
the dataset.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9532-0
00:55:48.527 --> 00:55:50.977
So we will end up with some
errors.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9540-0
00:55:51.207 --> 00:55:53.457
So that is how the model is.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9555-0
00:55:53.467 --> 00:55:58.122
So we have been given the
training data where X is given

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9555-1
00:55:58.122 --> 00:55:59.347
and Y is given.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9583-0
00:56:00.417 --> 00:56:05.593
Both are given, so we need to we
need to find the function F such

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9583-1
00:56:05.593 --> 00:56:10.612
that when we do this equation,
when we get this equation we can

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9583-2
00:56:10.612 --> 00:56:11.317
minimize.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9608-0
00:56:14.467 --> 00:56:19.359
E or in fact, we need to we
typically E square is minimized,

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9608-1
00:56:19.359 --> 00:56:22.807
which is the uh, the square of
the errors.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9642-0
00:56:24.447 --> 00:56:29.144
So the the point is we when with
simple linear regression, so

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9642-1
00:56:29.144 --> 00:56:33.765
using the least squared error
the best fitting straight line

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9642-2
00:56:33.765 --> 00:56:36.567
can be obtained using this
equation.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9650-0
00:56:43.367 --> 00:56:46.117
V this is representing the
gradient.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9670-0
00:56:50.707 --> 00:56:55.311
And this is representing the
offset so that is to say then we

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9670-1
00:56:55.311 --> 00:56:56.647
get this equation.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9675-0
00:56:56.657 --> 00:56:58.747
So this is representing the
offset.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9687-0
00:57:01.127 --> 00:57:05.427
When X is equal to 0 and then
this ratio is representing.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9692-0
00:57:14.967 --> 00:57:15.437
Right.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9698-0
00:57:15.507 --> 00:57:16.697
So this is equal to.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9704-0
00:57:16.707 --> 00:57:18.137
Let's say this is equal to M.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9726-0
00:57:18.227 --> 00:57:22.424
So what we get is Y is equal to
MX plus C so this is in this

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9726-1
00:57:22.424 --> 00:57:22.767
case.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9742-0
00:57:22.777 --> 00:57:27.076
This is actually this is the
gradient is equal to 1 and

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9742-1
00:57:27.076 --> 00:57:28.687
offset is equal to 0.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9761-0
00:57:30.157 --> 00:57:36.657
OK, so so now what we can do is
that we can we can do a I hope.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9778-0
00:57:38.777 --> 00:57:42.288
We'll do a very quick example
just to show that how this

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9778-1
00:57:42.288 --> 00:57:42.657
works.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9793-0
00:57:42.887 --> 00:57:47.197
So this is we can say I hope
you're able to read this.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9816-0
00:57:55.717 --> 00:57:58.427
OK, so this we can call this as
X.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9895-0
00:57:58.477 --> 00:58:03.280
The area of the house and the
price of the House, we can call

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9895-1
00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:07.929
this as a Y and then what we
need to do is that to get that

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9895-2
00:58:07.929 --> 00:58:12.654
gradient we need to compute the
mean of X mean of Y and then

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9895-3
00:58:12.654 --> 00:58:17.302
calculate this, multiply the
difference from the mean for X

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9895-4
00:58:17.302 --> 00:58:21.640
and with the difference from the
mean of the Y for each

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9895-5
00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:26.443
observation and then sum it up
and divide it by the square of

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9895-6
00:58:26.443 --> 00:58:28.457
the independent variables.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9900-0
00:58:28.467 --> 00:58:29.327
Distance from the mean.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9914-0
00:58:30.597 --> 00:58:34.567
So so the so we can hopefully do
it very quickly.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9919-0
00:58:34.577 --> 00:58:35.797
So we can compute the mean.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9933-0
00:58:38.147 --> 00:58:42.587
So the mean for this one is
going to be 176.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9943-0
00:58:44.837 --> 00:58:49.217
And mean for this one is 78.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9945-0
00:58:52.437 --> 00:58:52.677
Right.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9962-0
00:58:58.047 --> 00:59:03.347
OK, so now what we need to do is
that we need to compute X minus.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9974-0
00:59:06.477 --> 00:59:09.697
Mean of X and we need to
compute.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9989-0
00:59:09.707 --> 00:59:16.447
Why minus mean of Y and this we
can call it as a?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/9997-0
00:59:18.137 --> 00:59:20.347
Be and then so.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10004-0
00:59:20.397 --> 00:59:22.927
OK, So what is the value of
this?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10011-0
00:59:22.977 --> 00:59:24.567
This is minus 4, right?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10016-0
00:59:25.187 --> 00:59:27.177
This is minus 26.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10022-0
00:59:29.417 --> 00:59:30.177
This is fine.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10027-0
00:59:31.567 --> 00:59:32.667
This is minus 2.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10032-0
00:59:33.737 --> 00:59:35.107
This is 18.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10035-0
00:59:35.777 --> 00:59:37.157
This is 9 right?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10050-0
00:59:39.537 --> 00:59:43.127
Similarly, we have to compute
for the Y minus this.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10063-0
00:59:43.297 --> 00:59:47.197
So this is coming out as six,
this is minus 15.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10066-0
00:59:48.697 --> 00:59:49.967
This is minus one.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10073-0
00:59:50.587 --> 00:59:51.117
This is 0.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10077-0
00:59:52.217 --> 00:59:53.227
This is 12.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10081-0
00:59:54.147 --> 00:59:55.007
This is minus 2.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10115-0
00:59:57.047 --> 01:00:05.425
This we can call this as a queue
and then we need to compute uh P

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10115-1
01:00:05.425 --> 01:00:11.517
* Q and we need to compute the P
multiplied by.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10121-0
01:00:13.277 --> 01:00:15.107
Beat so.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10141-0
01:00:15.157 --> 01:00:26.220
So this will come out to minus
24 then minus 390 -, 5, G, zero

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10141-1
01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:27.097
then.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10158-0
01:00:27.507 --> 01:00:31.657
Oh sorry, this is 390 + 390 +
290.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10166-0
01:00:30.207 --> 01:00:31.057
Let's do 90.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10173-0
01:00:31.707 --> 01:00:32.817
Yeah, plus 390.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10186-0
01:00:33.137 --> 01:00:36.987
This is uh, uh one 216, right?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10191-0
01:00:37.617 --> 01:00:38.757
This is minus 18.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10193-0
01:00:40.407 --> 01:00:40.717
OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10205-0
01:00:41.007 --> 01:00:43.677
And then, uh, this is this is
16.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10221-0
01:00:45.437 --> 01:00:54.327
The seeds are 676254324, then
81.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10239-0
01:00:54.737 --> 01:00:57.882
So now what we need to do is
that we have to take a summation

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10239-1
01:00:57.882 --> 01:00:58.287
of this.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10247-0
01:00:58.677 --> 01:01:00.417
This is coming out to 559.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10263-0
01:01:02.777 --> 01:01:05.587
And this is coming out to be
summation of.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10269-0
01:01:05.597 --> 01:01:07.697
This is coming out to 11/26.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10274-0
01:01:09.807 --> 01:01:10.457
So.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10279-0
01:01:10.527 --> 01:01:11.397
So now what?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10291-0
01:01:11.407 --> 01:01:14.227
What this means is that the what
is the gradient?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10303-0
01:01:17.297 --> 01:01:19.247
Gradient is equal to.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10308-0
01:01:19.537 --> 01:01:20.477
This will come out to be.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10321-0
01:01:23.057 --> 01:01:25.057
Paint will be 559 by 1126.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10330-0
01:01:32.507 --> 01:01:34.537
So this is equal to 0.49.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10334-0
01:01:37.227 --> 01:01:38.357
And offset.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10363-0
01:01:42.547 --> 01:01:48.497
Offset is equal to, so we have
to take the mean of Y which is a

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10363-1
01:01:48.497 --> 01:01:51.657
so so OK I need to take equal
to.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10373-0
01:01:53.147 --> 01:02:00.647
78 -, 0.49 multiplied by.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10384-0
01:02:04.067 --> 01:02:06.327
How multiplied by 176, right?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10389-0
01:02:19.207 --> 01:02:19.577
Cool.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10395-0
01:02:19.667 --> 01:02:20.947
Well, we're fine, right?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10407-0
01:02:23.157 --> 01:02:25.147
So this is coming out to or.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10429-0
01:02:25.157 --> 01:02:30.895
This is not mean of why minus
49, so this is coming out to

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10429-1
01:02:30.895 --> 01:02:31.867
minus 8.2.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10440-0
01:02:34.827 --> 01:02:39.467
So what is the equation equation
is 0 point?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10447-0
01:02:42.877 --> 01:02:46.297
G -, 8.2.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10473-0
01:02:47.907 --> 01:02:56.297
4 + 0.49 * X So that is what is
going to give us the OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10482-0
01:02:56.307 --> 01:02:59.297
This is I think I showed to
remove this.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10503-0
01:03:09.847 --> 01:03:14.711
So so this is the way you can
derive the the simple linear

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10503-1
01:03:14.711 --> 01:03:15.617
regression.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10531-0
01:03:15.967 --> 01:03:19.627
So simple linear regression is
all it is doing is minimizing

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10522-0
01:03:17.747 --> 01:03:18.167
Set.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10531-1
01:03:19.627 --> 01:03:20.047
errors.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10534-0
01:03:20.057 --> 01:03:20.167
Yeah.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10544-0
01:03:20.977 --> 01:03:22.397
Off-site means Esquire, right?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10545-0
01:03:21.457 --> 01:03:21.867
OHS.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10550-0
01:03:21.877 --> 01:03:24.127
It means he square, right?
Pardon.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10567-0
01:03:25.327 --> 01:03:27.127
Of sit here is is square.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10562-0
01:03:25.897 --> 01:03:27.847
Offset is square.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10564-0
01:03:26.157 --> 01:03:26.497
Again.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10569-0
01:03:28.087 --> 01:03:28.457
No, no.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10586-0
01:03:28.467 --> 01:03:32.913
Offset is the gradient, the
place where the line meets the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10586-1
01:03:32.913 --> 01:03:33.817
when X is 0.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10597-0
01:03:36.067 --> 01:03:36.367
OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10590-0
01:03:36.617 --> 01:03:37.167
OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10614-0
01:03:37.387 --> 01:03:41.907
Just let me let me go to that
slide where sorry, I had drawn

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10614-1
01:03:41.907 --> 01:03:42.647
that this.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10642-0
01:03:42.697 --> 01:03:47.624
This is the offset, the place
where we are seeing you can you

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10642-1
01:03:47.624 --> 01:03:52.867
can see this offset that line is
intersecting X is equal to 0 AH.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10645-0
01:03:52.877 --> 01:03:54.107
This is the point.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10652-0
01:03:54.207 --> 01:03:55.477
This is called as offset.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10663-0
01:03:57.677 --> 01:03:58.797
OK, OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10658-0
01:03:58.267 --> 01:03:58.617
OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10672-0
01:03:59.407 --> 01:03:59.957
Yeah.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10685-0
01:04:00.017 --> 01:04:01.707
And when kisses that
calculation.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10682-0
01:04:00.047 --> 01:04:02.877
The offset, offset offset is
this.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10723-0
01:04:02.077 --> 01:04:05.601
Then, out of these two data, how
did we decided which one is the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10694-0
01:04:02.887 --> 01:04:04.037
How long these two data?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10726-0
01:04:04.047 --> 01:04:07.547
How they decided which one is he
and ritually skim?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10723-1
01:04:05.601 --> 01:04:06.847
and which one the skew?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10745-0
01:04:09.447 --> 01:04:11.747
I mean we have we have a area
and.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10746-0
01:04:09.597 --> 01:04:12.407
The POK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10748-0
01:04:12.937 --> 01:04:13.587
Yeah. Yeah.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10751-0
01:04:13.597 --> 01:04:13.947
No, no.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10753-0
01:04:13.957 --> 01:04:14.367
See.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10759-0
01:04:14.437 --> 01:04:15.227
See now.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10779-0
01:04:15.237 --> 01:04:18.544
Now the point is that that is
something we know that price

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10779-1
01:04:18.544 --> 01:04:21.177
depends on area but not the vice
versa, right?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10790-0
01:04:21.687 --> 01:04:25.227
That is how we go with the house
price, right?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10807-0
01:04:25.577 --> 01:04:28.372
This is this is just we are
taking one simple example which

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10807-1
01:04:28.372 --> 01:04:28.837
is common.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10822-0
01:04:30.177 --> 01:04:34.676
So independent variable is the
area of the house and dependent

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10822-1
01:04:34.676 --> 01:04:36.247
variable is the price.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10828-0
01:04:36.257 --> 01:04:37.527
Is that the question or
something else?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10841-0
01:04:39.717 --> 01:04:40.747
Yeah, that's the question.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10843-0
01:04:40.337 --> 01:04:41.327
Yeah, that's the question.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10972-0
01:04:40.757 --> 01:04:42.817
So the.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10846-0
01:04:41.337 --> 01:04:43.247
So OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10849-0
01:04:43.637 --> 01:04:44.147
Yeah, fine.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10851-0
01:04:44.157 --> 01:04:44.467
Right.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10863-0
01:04:44.537 --> 01:04:47.047
So any any case that has to be
given, what is X?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10866-0
01:04:47.057 --> 01:04:47.387
What is?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10875-0
01:04:47.397 --> 01:04:48.627
What is Y has to be given?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10897-0
01:04:48.917 --> 01:04:51.879
So if it is really a domain way
about which we have no

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10897-1
01:04:51.879 --> 01:04:54.517
knowledge, then there can be a
confusion, right?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10919-0
01:04:57.357 --> 01:05:00.457
When this is all sit formula I
want to.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10924-0
01:04:57.737 --> 01:05:02.647
Ohh then this is pop set formula
you want to uh.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10954-0
01:05:02.657 --> 01:05:07.182
The formula how did we get the
formula and offset offset offset

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10933-0
01:05:03.967 --> 01:05:04.637
Yeah. Hopefully.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10959-0
01:05:05.167 --> 01:05:07.557
Yeah, opposite offsetting the
conclusion.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10954-1
01:05:07.182 --> 01:05:07.747
formula?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10956-0
01:05:07.757 --> 01:05:08.307
Is this one?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10960-0
01:05:08.367 --> 01:05:08.997
Yeah, this one.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10983-0
01:05:11.807 --> 01:05:14.697
No, it what is the question
there in the opposite formula?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10993-0
01:05:15.287 --> 01:05:16.737
Uh, in the calculation there is.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/10997-0
01:05:15.837 --> 01:05:16.947
Uh, in the calculation?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11011-0
01:05:17.137 --> 01:05:20.427
Umm, yeah, yeah, that is, that
is what we have used.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11009-0
01:05:18.567 --> 01:05:18.747
And the.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11077-0
01:05:20.437 --> 01:05:24.559
We have used to calculate the
offset because we know the mean

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11029-0
01:05:22.937 --> 01:05:23.107
Yeah.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11077-1
01:05:24.559 --> 01:05:28.615
of X&amp;Y also, and we know the
gradient first, we find the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11077-2
01:05:28.615 --> 01:05:32.737
gradient and then we find the
offset to minus 8.2 this one to

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11076-0
01:05:29.477 --> 01:05:33.087
To minus 8.24 this wanted to see
how it came.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11077-3
01:05:32.737 --> 01:05:33.667
see how it is.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11094-0
01:05:36.127 --> 01:05:37.417
But can you repeat the question?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11127-0
01:05:37.987 --> 01:05:43.047
Ah, when this is minus 8.24, how
it how it is to that calculation

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11128-0
01:05:38.557 --> 01:05:43.381
Uh, we give the microstate to
put money on things to that

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11127-1
01:05:43.047 --> 01:05:44.657
I just want I missed.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11128-1
01:05:43.381 --> 01:05:45.377
conversation and missed.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11143-0
01:05:47.667 --> 01:05:49.377
Why minus Gideon into X?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11149-0
01:05:48.207 --> 01:05:49.937
Why minus katien into X?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11171-0
01:05:50.887 --> 01:05:55.497
OK, not X the mean of X mean of
X mean of yeah.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11168-0
01:05:51.307 --> 01:05:54.157
Sorry, X-Men takes me off.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11201-0
01:05:55.567 --> 01:05:59.240
So Y so that we can derive
actually that requires a little

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11201-1
01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:03.037
bit of partial differential
equations, we can derive it, but

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11201-2
01:06:03.037 --> 01:06:04.157
I won't do it now.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11214-0
01:06:04.207 --> 01:06:06.717
This is just you take this as a
formula as it is.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11271-0
01:06:07.187 --> 01:06:11.864
If you want, we can do it in
canvas or show how to derive

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11231-0
01:06:09.607 --> 01:06:10.357
I I.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11271-1
01:06:11.864 --> 01:06:17.104
this equation using the partial
differential equations we I just

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11242-0
01:06:14.367 --> 01:06:14.957
Winky said.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11281-0
01:06:14.967 --> 01:06:19.117
I just wanted to see 8.24 how
reach to that value.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11271-2
01:06:17.104 --> 01:06:18.797
want to speak 8.2443.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11283-0
01:06:18.807 --> 01:06:20.277
How did we get 8.24?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11299-0
01:06:20.267 --> 01:06:21.977
Yeah, yeah, yes, yes.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11294-0
01:06:20.287 --> 01:06:22.847
That is what you are saying,
yes, yes.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11310-0
01:06:22.907 --> 01:06:24.487
But how did we get 8.24?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11316-0
01:06:24.677 --> 01:06:25.107
OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11320-0
01:06:25.027 --> 01:06:25.267
Yes.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11328-0
01:06:25.117 --> 01:06:28.747
8.24, we got it through through
the same equation, right?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11339-0
01:06:28.817 --> 01:06:31.687
This is the equation you see the
equation.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11343-0
01:06:31.877 --> 01:06:32.397
Can you see that?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11419-0
01:06:35.807 --> 01:06:47.687
OK, all put things it 28.49 and
11760.49 is a pretty 176.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11363-0
01:06:36.347 --> 01:06:39.377
OK, I'll put the yeah, this is
the equation.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11372-0
01:06:39.387 --> 01:06:39.937
You can see.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11408-0
01:06:40.087 --> 01:06:47.437
Yeah, 149 in 11262.49 is a
pretty yeah.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11420-0
01:06:47.447 --> 01:06:48.857
0.49 is the gradient.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11442-0
01:06:48.867 --> 01:06:52.527
We got 78 and 176 are the mean
values we already know.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11448-0
01:06:53.397 --> 01:06:54.507
Ah, OK God.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11452-0
01:06:53.937 --> 01:06:55.207
Ah, OK, good.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11456-0
01:06:55.857 --> 01:06:56.397
Thank you. Yeah.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11454-0
01:06:55.897 --> 01:06:56.447
OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11457-0
01:06:56.457 --> 01:06:56.777
Thank you.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11505-0
01:07:02.267 --> 01:07:07.482
So, Sir, whichever that goes to
the act, which is dependent

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11474-0
01:07:02.857 --> 01:07:03.897
So, Sir, whichever.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11494-0
01:07:05.307 --> 01:07:09.937
Yes, Mr Rumic, which is Brendan.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11505-1
01:07:07.482 --> 01:07:10.697
variable that goes through my
right?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11500-0
01:07:09.947 --> 01:07:10.277
Very well.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11510-0
01:07:10.287 --> 01:07:13.117
That goes through by right
dependent variable is.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11512-0
01:07:13.127 --> 01:07:13.337
Why?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11517-0
01:07:13.347 --> 01:07:14.797
Right, right, that is correct.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11527-0
01:07:17.757 --> 01:07:21.187
So now we will look at few
concepts.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11554-0
01:07:21.237 --> 01:07:24.639
So that we can also have
multiple linear regression, so

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11554-1
01:07:24.639 --> 01:07:28.465
multiple linear regression is
more difficult, but we can solve

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11554-2
01:07:28.465 --> 01:07:28.647
it.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11564-0
01:07:28.657 --> 01:07:30.767
Still we can solve it when we
solve it.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11574-0
01:07:30.777 --> 01:07:34.507
We have this approach, just this
is only for.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11596-0
01:07:34.517 --> 01:07:37.817
If you want to explore on your
own, I don't want to go much

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11596-1
01:07:37.817 --> 01:07:39.467
further into this is based on.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11655-0
01:07:39.817 --> 01:07:45.379
We are deriving this using the
partial differential equations

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11655-1
01:07:45.379 --> 01:07:50.672
on the matrix expressions, so
when it is a multiple linear

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11655-2
01:07:50.672 --> 01:07:56.054
regression, we know that the
parameters that we have to the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11655-3
01:07:56.054 --> 01:08:01.527
data set is going to become a
matrix and then the parameters

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11655-4
01:08:01.527 --> 01:08:04.307
are becoming A1 dimensional so.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11662-0
01:08:05.257 --> 01:08:05.667
Uh.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11711-0
01:08:05.857 --> 01:08:11.432
And suppose D is the size of the
number of variables, so they're

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11711-1
01:08:11.432 --> 01:08:16.664
metrics will be d + 1 * 1, so
that will be the parameters so

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11711-2
01:08:16.664 --> 01:08:21.724
that we call that as a Theta and
then we want to solve the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11711-3
01:08:21.724 --> 01:08:23.267
analytically this.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11724-0
01:08:23.537 --> 01:08:26.892
And when we solve this, we are
going to get this closed form

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11724-1
01:08:26.892 --> 01:08:27.387
solution.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11750-0
01:08:27.977 --> 01:08:32.401
So which is that we have the
observations X from the training

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11750-1
01:08:32.401 --> 01:08:34.827
data X transpose multiplied by
X.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11804-0
01:08:34.837 --> 01:08:38.797
Then the universe metrics and
multiplied by the X transpose

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11804-1
01:08:38.797 --> 01:08:43.086
and then why that is how you are
going to get the Theta and this

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11804-2
01:08:43.086 --> 01:08:46.716
is just to indicate that even
for multiple uh multiple

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11804-3
01:08:46.716 --> 01:08:50.676
regression like simple linear
regression we can do it using

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11804-4
01:08:50.676 --> 01:08:51.467
the formula.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11892-0
01:08:52.017 --> 01:08:56.115
But then that is going to be
very costly operation if the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11892-1
01:08:56.115 --> 01:09:00.424
number of dimensions is logged
with small dimensions, we can

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11892-2
01:09:00.424 --> 01:09:04.945
still do this and other approach
that is typically taken, which

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11892-3
01:09:04.945 --> 01:09:09.325
you're going to study in depth
later, is the gradient descent

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11892-4
01:09:09.325 --> 01:09:13.916
which is, which can be done as a
linear algorithm, which is that

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11892-5
01:09:13.916 --> 01:09:18.437
you incrementally keep adjusting
the values of Theta by looking

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11892-6
01:09:18.437 --> 01:09:22.464
at the direction of the
correction based on the gradient

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11892-7
01:09:22.464 --> 01:09:25.077
with respect to the change in
Theta.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11933-0
01:09:25.427 --> 01:09:28.767
So how to reduce the error by
changing the Theta is something

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11933-1
01:09:28.767 --> 01:09:32.052
that you can compute by as a
gradient and then with the help

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11933-2
01:09:32.052 --> 01:09:35.337
of a learning rate you keep on
adjusting the value of Theta.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11989-0
01:09:35.347 --> 01:09:39.013
So this is a kind of a trial and
error, but this is what is

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11989-1
01:09:39.013 --> 01:09:42.678
actually driving the entire
machine learning and the neural

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11989-2
01:09:42.678 --> 01:09:46.099
networks, which is that you
learn the parameter through

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11989-3
01:09:46.099 --> 01:09:49.948
gradient descent, but that is
left for another course and then

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11989-4
01:09:49.948 --> 01:09:51.597
you will learn it in depth.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/11994-0
01:09:53.437 --> 01:09:54.007
So.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12015-0
01:09:54.017 --> 01:09:57.454
So the point is we can solve the
linear regressions using the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12015-1
01:09:57.454 --> 01:09:59.227
various approaches we looked at.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12018-0
01:09:59.237 --> 01:10:00.137
The simplest approach?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12052-0
01:10:00.147 --> 01:10:03.454
The complex approaches we are
living it for you to explore or

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12052-1
01:10:03.454 --> 01:10:06.601
learn it in the next semester
and then we can have another

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12052-2
01:10:06.601 --> 01:10:08.787
problem which is a nonlinear
regression.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12079-0
01:10:08.937 --> 01:10:12.329
Nonlinear regression is a far
more challenging problem to

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12079-1
01:10:12.329 --> 01:10:15.897
solve, and typically what we do
is that we convert it into a

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12079-2
01:10:15.897 --> 01:10:17.417
linear regression problem.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12112-0
01:10:18.357 --> 01:10:21.670
And what we do is that when we
have a nonlinear regression with

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12112-1
01:10:21.670 --> 01:10:24.982
one variable, we convert it into
a linear regression with three

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12112-2
01:10:24.982 --> 01:10:25.447
variable.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12115-0
01:10:25.697 --> 01:10:27.067
Suppose so.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12151-0
01:10:27.077 --> 01:10:30.480
This is your polynomial of order
three, so we are converting it

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12151-1
01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:33.670
to a linear regression with
three independent variables and

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12151-2
01:10:33.670 --> 01:10:36.487
then solve it and for this we
have the methods like.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12197-0
01:10:36.497 --> 01:10:40.433
We can use the gradient descent
to solve, but then if you want

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12197-1
01:10:40.433 --> 01:10:44.119
to stick with a nonlinear
regression, it is really becomes

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12197-2
01:10:44.119 --> 01:10:47.804
very challenging because the
problem is that the nonlinear

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12197-3
01:10:47.804 --> 01:10:50.990
regression you want to take
directly the nonlinear

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12197-4
01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:51.677
regression.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12237-0
01:10:52.087 --> 01:10:56.655
This this is a typically non
intractable problem, so the the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12237-1
01:10:56.655 --> 01:11:01.373
approach that is taken always is
that convert it into a linear

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12237-2
01:11:01.373 --> 01:11:04.967
regression through
transformation and solve it.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12280-0
01:11:08.447 --> 01:11:12.526
And this is this is 1 approach
and then there are there are

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12280-1
01:11:12.526 --> 01:11:16.740
actually other approaches that
there are two other approaches

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12280-2
01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:20.750
which we can we are briefly
going to look at one is called

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12280-3
01:11:20.750 --> 01:11:22.177
as a regression tree.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12288-0
01:11:22.447 --> 01:11:25.117
Regression Tree believes in
taking the approach like this.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12290-0
01:11:25.287 --> 01:11:25.767
It takes.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12312-0
01:11:30.227 --> 01:11:36.099
It converts this graph into this
form and thereby it tries to

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12312-1
01:11:36.099 --> 01:11:36.667
solve.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12327-0
01:11:37.437 --> 01:11:41.830
So this is the this is the
approach of regression tree we

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12327-1
01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:42.587
are going.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12335-0
01:11:42.637 --> 01:11:44.587
We are seeing it in a short
while.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12381-0
01:11:44.977 --> 01:11:50.409
So you approximate the graph
into in two a kind of points

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12381-1
01:11:50.409 --> 01:11:56.309
horizontal lines which will be
approximating the entire graph,

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12381-2
01:11:56.309 --> 01:12:01.646
or we have another one which is
which I can plot using a

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12381-3
01:12:01.646 --> 01:12:03.987
different color which is.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12402-0
01:12:08.567 --> 01:12:13.689
Which is called as a model tree
which is building multiple

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12402-1
01:12:13.689 --> 01:12:16.987
models that will approximate a
curve.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12424-0
01:12:17.837 --> 01:12:22.560
So both of them are not giving
you a nonlinear solutions, but

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12424-1
01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:25.607
pretty approximate nonlinear
solutions.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12444-0
01:12:25.957 --> 01:12:30.909
So the regression tree is that
each leaf of the tree will have

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12444-1
01:12:30.909 --> 01:12:33.267
a continuous value prediction.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12460-0
01:12:33.577 --> 01:12:37.487
So this is to say 1 leaf will be
corresponding to.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12465-0
01:12:37.497 --> 01:12:39.847
For example, corresponds to
this.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12489-0
01:12:39.857 --> 01:12:45.400
This indicates the value that is
indicated by Y1 here, and this

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12489-1
01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:48.517
is indicated by, let's say 8
three.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12512-0
01:12:48.847 --> 01:12:53.752
So each leaf is indicated by a
continuous value prediction, so

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12512-1
01:12:53.752 --> 01:12:58.346
that is regression tree and
model tree is even more tricky

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12512-2
01:12:58.346 --> 01:12:58.657
one.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12525-0
01:12:58.707 --> 01:13:02.317
So each leaf is represented by a
new model.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12531-0
01:13:03.117 --> 01:13:04.787
Each leaf will have a different
model.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12551-0
01:13:06.907 --> 01:13:10.020
And the regression trees and
model trees tend to be more

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12551-1
01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:11.767
accurate than linear regression.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12577-0
01:13:11.777 --> 01:13:15.863
That is easy to imagine, and so
can be used, and now we are just

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12577-1
01:13:15.863 --> 01:13:19.132
taking some examples just to
understand what is the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12577-2
01:13:19.132 --> 01:13:20.137
regression tree.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12592-0
01:13:20.347 --> 01:13:24.673
So this is indicating multiple
variables, so this is a golf

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12592-1
01:13:24.673 --> 01:13:25.177
player.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12609-0
01:13:25.187 --> 01:13:29.121
How many golf players show up at
the golf course depending on the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12609-1
01:13:29.121 --> 01:13:29.597
weather?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12624-0
01:13:29.967 --> 01:13:34.157
So what we do is that we start
finding the variable which is.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12638-0
01:13:34.227 --> 01:13:37.947
So the range of the variable is
25 to 52, right?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12649-0
01:13:40.107 --> 01:13:42.537
Minimum is 2323 to 52.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12672-0
01:13:44.867 --> 01:13:50.092
It is a wide range, So what we
try to do is that we try to

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12672-1
01:13:50.092 --> 01:13:51.597
reduce the range.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12690-0
01:13:51.807 --> 01:13:57.109
So now let us take we take
Outlook is sunny and let's say

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12690-1
01:13:57.109 --> 01:13:58.937
temperature is cool.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12733-0
01:13:59.047 --> 01:14:05.446
Now let us say sunny and cool is
38, so we are able to put get

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12733-1
01:14:05.446 --> 01:14:10.625
single value and when the
outlook is sunny and the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12733-2
01:14:10.625 --> 01:14:14.687
temperature is hot so one is 25
and 30.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12767-0
01:14:14.697 --> 01:14:20.613
We are taking the mean of 25 +
30 / 2, so we are taking the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12767-1
01:14:20.613 --> 01:14:25.147
average of 25 and 30 and we are
getting 27.5.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12802-0
01:14:25.577 --> 01:14:29.837
So now what we see is that at
every point, typically the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12802-1
01:14:29.837 --> 01:14:34.395
approach that is taken, the
algorithm that does is that, uh,

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12802-2
01:14:34.395 --> 01:14:37.757
it tries to reduce the variance
of the data.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12867-0
01:14:37.867 --> 01:14:41.813
So you take the entire data
variance and then take subset of

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12867-1
01:14:41.813 --> 01:14:45.952
the data and the subset like the
when we had the decision tree,

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12867-2
01:14:45.952 --> 01:14:50.091
we were dividing it based on the
attribute and we are trying to

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12867-3
01:14:50.091 --> 01:14:53.842
minimize the Gini value and in
this case we are trying to

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12867-4
01:14:53.842 --> 01:14:56.817
minimize the variance of the
target variable.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12873-0
01:14:56.907 --> 01:14:58.057
So that is the intent.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12909-0
01:14:58.677 --> 01:15:03.530
And so that is conceptually, if
you understand, that's good

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12909-1
01:15:03.530 --> 01:15:08.624
enough and then we can have a
model tree where we are building

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12909-2
01:15:08.624 --> 01:15:13.314
multiple models to represent the
data and each model is a

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12909-3
01:15:13.314 --> 01:15:14.527
distinct model.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12927-0
01:15:18.257 --> 01:15:24.277
OK, so this is all I wanted to
cover as the topic and we can.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12931-0
01:15:24.317 --> 01:15:25.217
Are there any questions?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12937-0
01:15:26.567 --> 01:15:28.827
Uh, on what we discussed till
now.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12948-0
01:15:31.797 --> 01:15:34.187
Are Mr Rajesh has asked a
question?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12981-0
01:15:34.197 --> 01:15:37.216
The topic currently being
covered in the method

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12981-1
01:15:37.216 --> 01:15:40.737
multivariate calculus is applied
specifically for this.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13001-0
01:15:39.947 --> 01:15:42.807
But not a question, not a
question of just everything. So.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12984-0
01:15:40.747 --> 01:15:41.477
Not a positive.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12988-0
01:15:41.717 --> 01:15:42.077
Yeah.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12990-0
01:15:42.087 --> 01:15:42.327
OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12993-0
01:15:42.337 --> 01:15:42.547
OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/12998-0
01:15:42.557 --> 01:15:43.667
OK, fine. Fine. Fine.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13017-0
01:15:43.677 --> 01:15:47.467
OK, so if fine if you are
learning it, that's good.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13041-0
01:15:47.517 --> 01:15:51.412
But let's say in any case you
will study in detail in machine

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13032-0
01:15:48.947 --> 01:15:50.057
Can you once explain?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13041-1
01:15:51.412 --> 01:15:51.977
learning.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13038-0
01:15:53.007 --> 01:15:53.477
Thank you, Sir.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13047-0
01:15:53.487 --> 01:15:54.277
Can you punch, please?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13068-0
01:15:54.287 --> 01:15:56.667
Please explain foil, gay and
boom.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13060-0
01:15:55.407 --> 01:15:56.057
Yes, Sir.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13066-0
01:15:56.127 --> 01:15:57.397
Somebody's asking a question.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13072-0
01:15:57.847 --> 01:15:58.787
I'm getting a low voice.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13082-0
01:16:00.447 --> 01:16:01.617
Venkata now I'm audible.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13080-0
01:16:01.027 --> 01:16:01.367
Thanks.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13083-0
01:16:03.077 --> 01:16:03.427
Yeah.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13088-0
01:16:03.437 --> 01:16:03.807
Can you?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13096-0
01:16:03.817 --> 01:16:04.737
Can you speak louder?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13134-0
01:16:05.657 --> 01:16:10.327
Can you once explain for you
gain and coffee in brief?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13119-0
01:16:06.237 --> 01:16:08.587
Can you once explain for you
gain and coffee?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13124-0
01:16:09.837 --> 01:16:10.007
Uh.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13130-0
01:16:10.017 --> 01:16:10.977
Which one foil gain?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13139-0
01:16:10.987 --> 01:16:11.497
What did you say?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13148-0
01:16:12.357 --> 01:16:12.767
Yeah.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13163-0
01:16:12.777 --> 01:16:13.797
For your gain and point.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13158-0
01:16:12.897 --> 01:16:14.457
You know, or you gain any voice?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13166-0
01:16:15.077 --> 01:16:15.837
Yeah, for you gain.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13173-0
01:16:15.847 --> 01:16:16.987
Yes, yes, we can do that.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13200-0
01:16:16.997 --> 01:16:20.185
We can do the file gain and what
is the other thing that you said

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13200-1
01:16:20.185 --> 01:16:20.957
I couldn't hear.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13212-0
01:16:20.867 --> 01:16:22.027
5 pruning.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13207-0
01:16:21.477 --> 01:16:22.877
Alright, 40 Paul.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13214-0
01:16:22.887 --> 01:16:23.907
Yes, yes, we'll do that.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13227-0
01:16:24.117 --> 01:16:26.777
We'll we'll look at the file
gain and file problem.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13230-0
01:16:26.787 --> 01:16:27.027
Yes.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13235-0
01:16:27.177 --> 01:16:28.827
In any other question, yes.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13238-0
01:16:29.247 --> 01:16:29.997
Anything else?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13272-0
01:16:30.557 --> 01:16:34.421
OK, So what do we do is that
we'll take a 3 minute break and

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13272-1
01:16:34.421 --> 01:16:38.284
then we'll review the entire
what we discussed in the course

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13272-2
01:16:38.284 --> 01:16:40.057
so far for the mid semester.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13276-0
01:16:41.877 --> 01:16:42.627
Course review.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13309-0
01:16:42.687 --> 01:16:45.965
We'll just spend half an hour
and at that time I will also

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13309-1
01:16:45.965 --> 01:16:49.243
take little simple example of
while gain and file prone to

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13309-2
01:16:49.243 --> 01:16:49.687
explain.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13311-0
01:16:49.877 --> 01:16:50.257
Is that fine.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13315-0
01:16:52.877 --> 01:16:53.177
OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13321-0
01:16:53.187 --> 01:16:53.567
Thank you.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13322-0
01:16:53.417 --> 01:16:54.457
Focus. Yeah.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13392-0
01:19:35.957 --> 01:19:37.687
OK, let's get restarted.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13406-0
01:19:37.697 --> 01:19:41.687
So what we do is that we do a
quick review of the entire.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13419-0
01:19:43.717 --> 01:19:44.397
Uh, see levels.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13436-0
01:19:44.407 --> 01:19:48.659
What we have done it till now,
so I'll take this is just to get

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13436-1
01:19:48.659 --> 01:19:50.187
the questions from you.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13476-0
01:19:52.537 --> 01:19:56.989
So the first session was more
about data science and we

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13476-1
01:19:56.989 --> 01:20:01.759
discussed what are all the tasks
that are there in the data

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13476-2
01:20:01.759 --> 01:20:06.609
science and then what are the
processes that are used and so

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13476-3
01:20:06.609 --> 01:20:06.847
on.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13519-0
01:20:07.517 --> 01:20:12.959
So this is the and then we
started looking at the various

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13519-1
01:20:12.959 --> 01:20:18.494
types of attributes that are
present and from data science

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13519-2
01:20:18.494 --> 01:20:23.935
perspective, we are going to
group the attributes using a

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13519-3
01:20:23.935 --> 01:20:25.717
different criteria.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13565-0
01:20:26.187 --> 01:20:30.455
Then typically that is done when
you are doing storing it as a

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13565-1
01:20:30.455 --> 01:20:34.858
file or a in a database, because
here we are not concerned about

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13565-2
01:20:34.858 --> 01:20:39.057
really about the size, but then
we are looking at a different

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13565-3
01:20:39.057 --> 01:20:42.647
characteristics so that we can
use it for analytics.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13588-0
01:20:47.747 --> 01:20:53.837
We looked at data quality, then
we have seen that data quality

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13588-1
01:20:53.837 --> 01:20:57.317
is something not so easy to
define.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13601-0
01:20:57.567 --> 01:21:00.367
So there can be many aspects to
that.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13605-0
01:21:00.947 --> 01:21:03.167
So so including.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13636-0
01:21:20.707 --> 01:21:25.841
And we have seen that given data
there are going to be all kinds

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13636-1
01:21:25.841 --> 01:21:30.817
of problems including the noise
outliers, then missing values.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13657-0
01:21:31.127 --> 01:21:36.804
And so we have to find ways to
fix the problems, and these

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13657-1
01:21:36.804 --> 01:21:41.037
fixes can never be completely
satisfactory.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13694-0
01:21:41.647 --> 01:21:46.748
But we may have to use some
knowledge of the domain or we

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13694-1
01:21:46.748 --> 01:21:52.024
have to go to the some domain
expert and understand what is

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13694-2
01:21:52.024 --> 01:21:56.157
the what is the impactful way to
fix the data.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13714-0
01:21:58.817 --> 01:22:02.496
And we have also seen that one
of the problems with the data is

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13714-1
01:22:02.496 --> 01:22:03.587
the dimensionality.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13753-0
01:22:04.317 --> 01:22:09.799
And so the when we are trying to
reduce the dimension, so the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13753-1
01:22:09.799 --> 01:22:15.457
model becomes more interpretable
and also the IT is possible to

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13753-2
01:22:15.457 --> 01:22:21.027
look at the interaction between
the various dimensions better.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13774-0
01:22:21.857 --> 01:22:25.022
But if you have too many
dimensions, so we may never be

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13774-1
01:22:25.022 --> 01:22:28.187
able to capture the interaction
among those dimensions.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13814-0
01:22:30.077 --> 01:22:34.954
We had looked at these
statistical descriptions so that

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13814-1
01:22:34.954 --> 01:22:40.266
included ohh many of these and
we had also seen that given a

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13814-2
01:22:40.266 --> 01:22:45.055
data so we may want to make some
assumptions about the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13814-3
01:22:45.055 --> 01:22:46.187
distribution.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13858-0
01:22:46.617 --> 01:22:50.552
So this is more of an assumption
so that it follows a normal

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13858-1
01:22:50.552 --> 01:22:54.552
distribution because there are a
lot of mathematics have been

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13858-2
01:22:54.552 --> 01:22:58.486
developed around the normal
distribution and then the tables

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13858-3
01:22:58.486 --> 01:22:59.647
are all available.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13867-0
01:23:00.017 --> 01:23:04.427
But really, the data that we got
get is represented by.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13887-0
01:23:10.267 --> 01:23:15.985
So the point is, it is the way
we approximate and then go ahead

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13887-1
01:23:15.985 --> 01:23:16.967
is the one.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13913-0
01:23:17.227 --> 01:23:21.879
So it is and added to that we
what we know is that we may

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13913-1
01:23:21.879 --> 01:23:25.567
seldom get a distribution which
is symmetric.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13944-0
01:23:26.787 --> 01:23:31.646
So so that all that is the other
thing that we have to live with

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13944-1
01:23:31.646 --> 01:23:35.608
and we can measure the
dispersion of the in the data

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13944-2
01:23:35.608 --> 01:23:37.327
using various measures.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13964-0
01:23:44.757 --> 01:23:48.826
And we have looked at how to
create 5 number summary and then

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13964-1
01:23:48.826 --> 01:23:50.007
create a box plot.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13994-0
01:23:54.587 --> 01:23:59.869
And we may need to do a
normalization when we have that

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/13994-1
01:23:59.869 --> 01:24:04.207
data because the data comes with
wide ranges.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14028-0
01:24:05.477 --> 01:24:10.735
Uh, there is no set range, so
the attributes impact and its

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14028-1
01:24:10.735 --> 01:24:15.467
measurement are the scale may
not have any relations.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14053-0
01:24:15.477 --> 01:24:20.140
So in that sense, so if there is
a strongly impacting data, but

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14053-1
01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:23.127
it's measurement is an only
millimeters.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14095-0
01:24:23.497 --> 01:24:28.040
So we need to think in terms of
doing a proper normalization so

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14095-1
01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:32.157
that its value can be captured
properly and similarly the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14095-2
01:24:32.157 --> 01:24:36.628
income can go into billions and
trillions, but then the impact

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14095-3
01:24:36.628 --> 01:24:38.757
it will do to the our problem.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14119-0
01:24:38.767 --> 01:24:42.903
Maybe may may not be in direct
proportion to that, so we need

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14119-1
01:24:42.903 --> 01:24:45.437
to think in terms of a
normalization.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14139-0
01:24:46.027 --> 01:24:49.523
Again, there is nothing like a
perfect normalization, but then

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14139-1
01:24:49.523 --> 01:24:51.687
we may have to try various
approaches.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14162-0
01:24:53.207 --> 01:24:59.711
So so that, uh, the the impact
that the normalized variable

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14162-1
01:24:59.711 --> 01:25:02.637
creates will be reasonable.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14178-0
01:25:06.127 --> 01:25:12.312
And then when we have complex
data objects so the this is the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14178-1
01:25:12.312 --> 01:25:14.007
distance between.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14189-0
01:25:32.517 --> 01:25:38.847
And we can we can perform some
data.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14193-0
01:25:40.877 --> 01:25:41.387
What?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14213-0
01:25:41.397 --> 01:25:46.131
What we call is as redundancy
identification through the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14213-1
01:25:46.131 --> 01:25:50.117
techniques such as uh,
correlation, covariance.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14224-0
01:25:53.747 --> 01:25:56.377
And and then the chisquare.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14239-0
01:26:01.687 --> 01:26:06.557
And then we looked at
classification and prediction.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14255-0
01:26:07.107 --> 01:26:11.259
So classification, we have seen
that we can we looked at

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14255-1
01:26:11.259 --> 01:26:13.807
Decision Tree and then rule
based.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14273-0
01:26:16.257 --> 01:26:19.515
And in the decision tree, we
looked at Ginny and then

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14273-1
01:26:19.515 --> 01:26:19.997
entropy.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14279-0
01:26:21.927 --> 01:26:22.917
Or gain ratio.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14289-0
01:26:25.447 --> 01:26:28.247
And rule based we had looked at
the foil.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14293-0
01:26:36.987 --> 01:26:37.617
What else?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14297-0
01:26:37.707 --> 01:26:38.517
The prediction.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14318-0
01:26:38.737 --> 01:26:42.626
OK, So what we'll do is that
we'll go into the slide deck

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14318-1
01:26:42.626 --> 01:26:43.497
that has got.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14334-0
01:26:45.437 --> 01:26:49.427
Ohh rule based this we discussed
in the last class right.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14348-0
01:26:51.227 --> 01:26:53.337
Sir, can we have your question
properly?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14351-0
01:26:51.757 --> 01:26:54.007
2nd we have your question
properly.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14360-0
01:26:55.257 --> 01:26:56.677
Love the last year.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14361-0
01:26:55.767 --> 01:26:57.227
Love the last year.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14401-0
01:27:00.207 --> 01:27:05.049
Miss Ruby, I posted 1 sample
Question paper in canvas and let

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14401-1
01:27:05.049 --> 01:27:10.126
me let me also forborne you that
these question papers come with

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14401-2
01:27:10.126 --> 01:27:13.327
no warranty or guarantee kind of
things.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14452-0
01:27:13.987 --> 01:27:18.606
So the point is the maybe
because the last semester you

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14452-1
01:27:18.606 --> 01:27:23.720
have to check because they're
different faculty has taken the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14452-2
01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:28.256
I was not involved with this
course, but I do not know

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14452-3
01:27:28.256 --> 01:27:32.380
whether the that giving the
sample is good enough

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14452-4
01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:33.287
indication.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14479-0
01:27:33.297 --> 01:27:36.947
I'm not sure whether the the
last year's pattern app I'll

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14479-1
01:27:36.947 --> 01:27:40.407
have to find out where it is and
I'll have to give it.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14488-0
01:27:41.577 --> 01:27:43.017
I do not know whether I'll be.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14491-0
01:27:43.077 --> 01:27:43.727
I'll. I'll.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14511-0
01:27:43.737 --> 01:27:46.804
I'll give a try, but I I don't
know who has that last year's

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14511-1
01:27:46.804 --> 01:27:47.557
question paper.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14532-0
01:27:49.097 --> 01:27:50.887
So would be a handy turn exam.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14533-0
01:27:49.657 --> 01:27:51.397
So we'll be handed down again.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14541-0
01:27:52.997 --> 01:27:55.007
Uh, I understand this
examination.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14576-0
01:27:55.017 --> 01:27:58.747
Yes, you may have to write it,
but then the question papers

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14576-1
01:27:58.747 --> 01:28:02.663
will be given will be given to
electronically and then you can

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14576-2
01:28:02.663 --> 01:28:06.641
possibly write it and then there
will be provision for scanning

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14576-3
01:28:06.641 --> 01:28:06.827
it.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14596-0
01:28:11.597 --> 01:28:14.439
So if that is what you prefer,
and you will also have an

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14596-1
01:28:14.439 --> 01:28:14.787
option.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14613-0
01:28:14.977 --> 01:28:18.468
So if you want to type the
answer in the then also the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14613-1
01:28:18.468 --> 01:28:20.117
machine will be available.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14642-0
01:28:25.017 --> 01:28:27.567
So what would be the poetter
like the heretic?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14643-0
01:28:25.577 --> 01:28:28.897
So what would the President like
that already the name it?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14665-0
01:28:30.897 --> 01:28:34.479
The you were saying whether the
questions will be required

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14665-1
01:28:34.479 --> 01:28:36.117
calculations or not, right?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14676-0
01:28:36.377 --> 01:28:37.577
Yes, correct.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14686-0
01:28:36.937 --> 01:28:39.912
Yes, there will be some
questions requiring calculations

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14686-1
01:28:39.912 --> 01:28:42.677
and few questions which may not
require calculation.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14725-0
01:28:49.707 --> 01:28:54.327
OK, so now let me go into the
like formulas provided the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14735-0
01:28:51.587 --> 01:28:57.156
Like formulas provided by in the
paper itself, like usually it's

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14725-1
01:28:54.327 --> 01:28:56.677
formula will not be provided.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14733-0
01:28:56.687 --> 01:28:57.217
No, no.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14735-1
01:28:57.156 --> 01:28:57.927
provided.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14736-0
01:28:57.227 --> 01:28:59.177
Unfortunately, yeah.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14742-0
01:28:59.187 --> 01:29:03.147
The OK, so this is OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14756-0
01:29:03.197 --> 01:29:07.287
So you want me to tell you how
to solve this problem, right?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14763-0
01:29:07.577 --> 01:29:08.257
OK, I can do that.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14768-0
01:29:09.967 --> 01:29:10.587
I can do that.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14774-0
01:29:10.597 --> 01:29:12.917
OK, so did I.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14789-0
01:29:12.987 --> 01:29:15.684
OK, this is this was there in
the sample Question paper,

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14789-1
01:29:15.684 --> 01:29:15.967
right?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14797-0
01:29:16.957 --> 01:29:17.377
Yes, Sir.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14795-0
01:29:17.507 --> 01:29:18.467
Yes, OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14799-0
01:29:18.477 --> 01:29:19.097
OK, fine.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14803-0
01:29:19.327 --> 01:29:19.657
Fine.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14810-0
01:29:19.667 --> 01:29:22.067
Then let me let me do that.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14820-0
01:29:23.387 --> 01:29:27.717
Ohh OK so so this is OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14860-0
01:29:27.787 --> 01:29:31.662
So what I will do is that this
this one you can try it and if

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14860-1
01:29:31.662 --> 01:29:35.723
you have a problem, come back to
me I will solve what I'll do is

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14860-2
01:29:35.723 --> 01:29:37.847
I'm going to do different
things.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14867-0
01:29:38.757 --> 01:29:39.847
Ohh what?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14873-0
01:29:39.857 --> 01:29:40.357
What happened?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14881-0
01:29:41.557 --> 01:29:42.997
So there is one question, Sir.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14883-0
01:29:42.227 --> 01:29:43.517
But there is one question for.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14904-0
01:29:45.117 --> 01:29:48.067
No, no, no data model for
Netflix.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14908-0
01:29:45.247 --> 01:29:48.617
Uh, no, not the model for the
Netflix.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14912-0
01:29:48.257 --> 01:29:49.097
Can you explain that?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14916-0
01:29:48.847 --> 01:29:49.667
Can you explain that?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14926-0
01:29:50.627 --> 01:29:51.827
Like how we can go.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14928-0
01:29:51.157 --> 01:29:52.357
Like how we can go.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14931-0
01:29:53.437 --> 01:29:54.767
Ah, let me.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14939-0
01:29:54.947 --> 01:29:56.107
Let me answer 1 by 1.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14941-0
01:29:56.157 --> 01:29:56.757
Maybe.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14951-0
01:29:56.797 --> 01:29:58.497
Maybe your question I will take
first.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14959-0
01:29:58.507 --> 01:29:59.927
So can you repeat the question?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14962-0
01:29:59.937 --> 01:30:00.577
I have not understood.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14970-0
01:30:02.267 --> 01:30:02.677
So.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14976-0
01:30:02.777 --> 01:30:03.207
So.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15046-0
01:30:03.227 --> 01:30:08.895
So the paper which you shared in
that paper, there is one

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/14985-0
01:30:03.817 --> 01:30:05.747
So the paper with you here.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15031-0
01:30:07.757 --> 01:30:11.858
In that paper there is one
position related to model

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15046-1
01:30:08.895 --> 01:30:14.563
question related to model
created model for Netflix based

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15031-1
01:30:11.858 --> 01:30:13.947
creative model for Netflix.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15044-0
01:30:14.197 --> 01:30:16.987
Based on the user's OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15046-2
01:30:14.563 --> 01:30:16.517
on the use of image.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15052-0
01:30:17.077 --> 01:30:17.477
Yeah, OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15066-0
01:30:18.197 --> 01:30:19.927
How we go that question?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15070-0
01:30:18.727 --> 01:30:20.477
How we go that direction?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15084-0
01:30:19.937 --> 01:30:21.887
Like how we proceed with that
question?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15090-0
01:30:20.487 --> 01:30:22.417
Like how we proceed with that
question?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15095-0
01:30:21.897 --> 01:30:22.727
Like what?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15098-0
01:30:22.427 --> 01:30:23.277
Like what?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15118-0
01:30:22.737 --> 01:30:26.437
We need to create and what
should be our thinking?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15107-0
01:30:23.287 --> 01:30:24.467
We need to create and.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15109-0
01:30:25.717 --> 01:30:26.177
What?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15111-0
01:30:26.227 --> 01:30:26.647
What?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15113-0
01:30:26.877 --> 01:30:27.247
OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15116-0
01:30:27.257 --> 01:30:28.007
OK, OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15125-0
01:30:28.017 --> 01:30:29.367
So The thing is so.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15138-0
01:30:29.377 --> 01:30:32.737
So what you are saying is OK,
let me let me go into.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15162-0
01:31:00.107 --> 01:31:00.367
Yeah.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15182-0
01:31:00.427 --> 01:31:01.837
Or with them just close to.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15189-0
01:31:00.427 --> 01:31:01.207
This post to.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15186-0
01:31:02.207 --> 01:31:02.597
Yeah.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15190-0
01:31:02.607 --> 01:31:03.457
Just give me one minute.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15194-0
01:31:09.407 --> 01:31:11.577
Yeah, OK. Alright.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15200-0
01:31:16.647 --> 01:31:18.527
OK, so this is the.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15210-0
01:31:20.357 --> 01:31:23.887
On Netflix model in the sample
question paper.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15212-0
01:31:24.967 --> 01:31:25.417
OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15219-0
01:31:25.427 --> 01:31:26.377
OK, OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15237-0
01:31:26.457 --> 01:31:30.434
So so building your ML model
that recommends appropriate

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15226-0
01:31:27.117 --> 01:31:27.407
If the.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15237-1
01:31:30.434 --> 01:31:32.317
shows for Netflix for kids.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15254-0
01:31:32.927 --> 01:31:35.727
Choose the specific performance
metrics that you would use to

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15254-1
01:31:35.727 --> 01:31:37.397
measure effectiveness of your
model.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15259-0
01:31:37.407 --> 01:31:38.287
Justify your choice.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15264-0
01:31:39.147 --> 01:31:40.217
Uh, so.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15287-0
01:31:40.267 --> 01:31:45.957
So the point is that ohh the in
this case the you are really

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15287-1
01:31:45.957 --> 01:31:50.807
thinking about what should be
the attributes right?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15316-0
01:31:52.217 --> 01:31:56.538
And then you you need to think
in terms of the attributes and

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15316-1
01:31:56.538 --> 01:32:00.720
then you need to think in terms
of what is that you need to

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15316-2
01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:01.277
predict.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15328-0
01:32:01.287 --> 01:32:05.907
So essentially this is to help
you create a problem.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15354-0
01:32:05.917 --> 01:32:08.319
For example, in your
organization you may have a

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15354-1
01:32:08.319 --> 01:32:11.407
situation, but can you convert
it into a data science problem?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15361-0
01:32:11.677 --> 01:32:13.267
So that is what it is talking
about.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15389-0
01:32:13.677 --> 01:32:18.596
So in case of a Netflix, for
example movie, so the you need

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15389-1
01:32:18.596 --> 01:32:21.957
to say what is appropriate for
the kids.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15392-0
01:32:22.447 --> 01:32:23.457
So what?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15403-0
01:32:23.467 --> 01:32:25.677
What is it that that you are
going to consider?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15430-0
01:32:26.357 --> 01:32:30.967
So it is possible that you are
going to consider the things

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15430-1
01:32:30.967 --> 01:32:35.807
like the level of the violence
content, right and the weather.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15467-0
01:32:35.817 --> 01:32:40.031
You can convert that into the
the OR or you may need to think

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15467-1
01:32:40.031 --> 01:32:43.769
in terms of the other
attributes, whether the theme is

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15467-2
01:32:43.769 --> 01:32:47.507
related to the kids or is it
suitable for kids or not.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15526-0
01:32:48.277 --> 01:32:52.657
So the point is you need to
think in terms of the attributes

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15526-1
01:32:52.657 --> 01:32:56.821
and then you need to think in
terms of what is the way in

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15526-2
01:32:56.821 --> 01:33:01.201
which you are going to create
the model and then finally you

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15526-3
01:33:01.201 --> 01:33:05.653
need to say whether the model
what is the result that you are

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15526-4
01:33:05.653 --> 01:33:07.447
expecting from the model.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15542-0
01:33:08.437 --> 01:33:13.176
So this is more like can you
formulate a problem given some

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15542-1
01:33:13.176 --> 01:33:13.807
context?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15558-0
01:33:14.537 --> 01:33:18.977
Does that uh, is that clear or
or are we?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15567-0
01:33:19.407 --> 01:33:21.007
Yes, Sir, one more thing.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15564-0
01:33:19.927 --> 01:33:20.557
Yes, Sir.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15574-0
01:33:20.817 --> 01:33:21.757
One thing.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15579-0
01:33:21.997 --> 01:33:23.577
Yes, yes.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15619-0
01:33:22.767 --> 01:33:28.281
Uh, so in this model we consider
user activity as well as the not

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15606-0
01:33:23.587 --> 01:33:28.727
So in this model we consider
user acting as well.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15619-1
01:33:28.281 --> 01:33:29.617
the contracting.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15614-0
01:33:28.737 --> 01:33:29.867
No, no, no, no, no.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15636-0
01:33:29.877 --> 01:33:32.738
The user attribute only thing is
that the Netflix can ask is

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15636-1
01:33:32.738 --> 01:33:34.097
whether you are a kid or not.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15642-0
01:33:34.107 --> 01:33:35.967
Then it can't ask anything else,
right?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15649-0
01:33:36.577 --> 01:33:37.737
It can't say that.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15653-0
01:33:36.717 --> 01:33:37.257
OK, OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15670-0
01:33:38.257 --> 01:33:40.962
What is your IQ level or what
type of person you are in that

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15670-1
01:33:40.962 --> 01:33:41.627
type of things?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15677-0
01:33:41.637 --> 01:33:42.227
It can't ask.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15697-0
01:33:42.967 --> 01:33:46.504
It is really talking about age
appropriate, so see in any case

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15697-1
01:33:46.504 --> 01:33:46.897
it's a.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15706-0
01:33:47.127 --> 01:33:49.177
It's really more of a soft
aspect.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15708-0
01:33:49.187 --> 01:33:49.747
So.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15737-0
01:33:49.787 --> 01:33:53.032
So the point is the evaluator
will be looking at the soft

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15737-1
01:33:53.032 --> 01:33:56.387
aspects of the answer, so there
is no hard answer for this.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15755-0
01:33:57.807 --> 01:33:59.967
So this is a theoretical
question, right?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15758-0
01:33:58.377 --> 01:34:00.627
So this is a theoretical
question, right?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15775-0
01:34:00.117 --> 01:34:02.707
The but now we have to explain.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15769-0
01:34:01.277 --> 01:34:02.327
No, no, no.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15785-0
01:34:02.337 --> 01:34:05.786
My question is that again I'm
I'm little confused when people

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15785-1
01:34:05.786 --> 01:34:07.287
start talking about theory.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15792-0
01:34:07.297 --> 01:34:08.747
What exactly is theory?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15800-0
01:34:08.757 --> 01:34:09.707
Maybe you can help me.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15819-0
01:34:10.097 --> 01:34:11.397
There is no calculation
question.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15812-0
01:34:10.447 --> 01:34:11.877
So do we need to?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15826-0
01:34:12.027 --> 01:34:13.057
No, no, I get it.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15861-0
01:34:12.047 --> 01:34:16.135
Ohh no no, I get this trying to
explaining the problem in terms

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15881-0
01:34:13.147 --> 01:34:17.488
So while explaining the problem
in terms of data science, do I

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15861-1
01:34:16.135 --> 01:34:17.157
of data science.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15887-0
01:34:17.167 --> 01:34:21.197
Do I need to say that this is
the data being used?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15881-1
01:34:17.488 --> 01:34:20.657
need to say that this is the
data being used?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15899-0
01:34:20.657 --> 01:34:22.997
To say you know these are the
attributes in here.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15912-0
01:34:21.207 --> 01:34:24.937
Since you know these are the
attribute, the class. Right.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15906-0
01:34:23.007 --> 01:34:23.957
This is the class.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15940-0
01:34:24.447 --> 01:34:27.657
Is that how we're supposed to
explain the problem?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15916-0
01:34:24.947 --> 01:34:25.207
Right.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15936-0
01:34:25.217 --> 01:34:28.037
That how we're supposed to make
that is right the see.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15971-0
01:34:28.467 --> 01:34:32.514
Yeah, because the model see the
question is when you're looking

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15971-1
01:34:32.514 --> 01:34:35.865
at so specific performance
metrics, you would use to

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/15971-2
01:34:35.865 --> 01:34:38.457
measure the effectiveness of
your model.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16028-0
01:34:39.017 --> 01:34:43.035
And so the problem is that you
are trying to build a model and

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16028-1
01:34:43.035 --> 01:34:46.798
then you were also looking at
the outcome of the model and

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16028-2
01:34:46.798 --> 01:34:50.752
then the outcome of the model is
whether it's what is the age

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16028-3
01:34:50.752 --> 01:34:54.579
appropriateness and then what is
it that you are expecting,

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16028-4
01:34:54.579 --> 01:34:58.277
whether you are talking about
higher precision or higher?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16031-0
01:34:58.287 --> 01:34:58.707
Recall.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16036-0
01:34:58.717 --> 01:34:59.877
And what do you think about
that?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16051-0
01:34:59.887 --> 01:35:03.057
So possibly you need to talk
about those aspects.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16057-0
01:35:03.067 --> 01:35:05.145
Essentially, the soft
understanding of what we

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16057-1
01:35:05.145 --> 01:35:05.587
discussed.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16063-0
01:35:08.987 --> 01:35:09.347
OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16067-0
01:35:09.507 --> 01:35:09.867
OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16075-0
01:35:10.757 --> 01:35:12.147
The should we also create a?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16086-0
01:35:11.477 --> 01:35:13.197
Should we also create a team?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16105-0
01:35:12.157 --> 01:35:15.787
Well, any ohh this isn't be of
order.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16088-0
01:35:14.277 --> 01:35:14.687
Pardon.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16101-0
01:35:14.697 --> 01:35:16.587
Ohh, this isn't the your model.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16106-0
01:35:16.757 --> 01:35:17.327
No, no, no.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16111-0
01:35:17.337 --> 01:35:18.027
The decision tree.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16115-0
01:35:18.037 --> 01:35:18.707
How will you create?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16129-0
01:35:18.717 --> 01:35:21.347
Because in this case attributes
and values are not there.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16152-0
01:35:21.497 --> 01:35:24.527
So you may say whether you want
to create a model, but I don't

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16152-1
01:35:24.527 --> 01:35:26.547
think that that is expected in
this case.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16198-0
01:35:26.557 --> 01:35:30.765
At least it's not asking for
that, so it is asking only about

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16179-0
01:35:29.207 --> 01:35:29.487
OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16194-0
01:35:29.287 --> 01:35:31.977
So in this case, recall is going
to help us raise.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16198-1
01:35:30.765 --> 01:35:35.040
this call is going to help us
raise that is possibly yes, yes,

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16198-2
01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:35.447
right.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16206-0
01:35:42.347 --> 01:35:44.387
OK, then this is the.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16221-0
01:35:44.447 --> 01:35:48.607
This is the one you are asking
about and let me let me do it.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16228-0
01:35:48.657 --> 01:35:52.237
Do the problem on a slide.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16236-0
01:35:52.327 --> 01:35:55.747
So let me create a small new
slide.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16241-0
01:35:59.467 --> 01:36:00.677
And take this.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16279-0
01:36:19.727 --> 01:36:25.033
So I can do this now what we are
saying is that let us take did

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16279-1
01:36:25.033 --> 01:36:29.427
it mention the type of the
heuristic has to be used?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16296-0
01:36:30.687 --> 01:36:34.647
The heuristic has to be it's
improved entropy.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16303-0
01:36:32.937 --> 01:36:33.967
It's entropy there.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16299-0
01:36:34.657 --> 01:36:35.287
OK, OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16307-0
01:36:35.297 --> 01:36:36.217
So we'll go with entropy.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16309-0
01:36:36.227 --> 01:36:36.467
Fine.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16312-0
01:36:36.527 --> 01:36:37.077
Yeah, alright.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16337-0
01:36:38.367 --> 01:36:44.112
OK, so now now the now the
question is that there are this

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16337-1
01:36:44.112 --> 01:36:49.077
is in simple 2 attribute and
then one class label.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16345-0
01:36:49.167 --> 01:36:51.767
OK, so at the root.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16360-0
01:36:51.847 --> 01:36:58.117
So this is their data, 9 tuples
and out of them 4 positives.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16373-0
01:37:04.727 --> 01:37:09.647
9 tuples food positive and five
negative.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16396-0
01:37:09.917 --> 01:37:21.050
So entropy is of the data set is
4 by 9, log 24 by 9, less 5 by

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16396-1
01:37:21.050 --> 01:37:21.397
9.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16404-0
01:37:24.637 --> 01:37:26.487
Log 25 by 9.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16414-0
01:37:27.057 --> 01:37:29.787
OK, so this is this is what is
happening.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16424-0
01:37:29.837 --> 01:37:32.287
OK, so I will hold this
computation.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16449-0
01:37:32.297 --> 01:37:36.973
I can do the computation, but
I'll just hold it and then

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16449-1
01:37:36.973 --> 01:37:41.567
suppose that I use the attribute
one and attribute one.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16464-0
01:37:41.617 --> 01:37:45.657
I divide so it can take a value
of true or false.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16484-0
01:37:46.827 --> 01:37:51.523
So if we take say attribute
true, there are four tuples out

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16484-1
01:37:51.523 --> 01:37:55.357
of them, three are positive and
one is negative.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16490-0
01:38:03.587 --> 01:38:04.167
Thank you.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16497-0
01:38:04.217 --> 01:38:05.427
False will be.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16509-0
01:38:05.437 --> 01:38:11.127
Obviously there are one positive
and for the negative, OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16518-0
01:38:11.307 --> 01:38:14.387
And then actually mute two, what
is it doing?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16521-0
01:38:14.437 --> 01:38:14.957
It is.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16533-0
01:38:15.017 --> 01:38:17.347
It is also having a values of
true or false.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16541-0
01:38:17.757 --> 01:38:19.187
So how many trues it has?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16555-0
01:38:19.197 --> 01:38:24.637
It has five trues and out of
them two or positive.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16565-0
01:38:26.897 --> 01:38:29.177
And three are negative, right?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16571-0
01:38:29.957 --> 01:38:31.607
And then falls.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16575-0
01:38:32.637 --> 01:38:34.387
So there will be 2 positive.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16582-0
01:38:35.337 --> 01:38:38.177
And then two negative.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16611-0
01:38:42.077 --> 01:38:46.647
So now what we have to see is
that which is the split which is

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16611-1
01:38:46.647 --> 01:38:49.547
giving us a bigger gain in the
entropy.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16620-0
01:38:50.497 --> 01:38:54.477
So the problem is problem is
clear right?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16635-0
01:38:54.487 --> 01:38:56.637
So now I now I can do the
calculations.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16638-0
01:38:56.647 --> 01:38:57.377
No problems.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16640-0
01:38:57.647 --> 01:38:59.317
So first, uh.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16649-0
01:39:01.197 --> 01:39:04.797
The question was raised by May.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16670-0
01:39:04.807 --> 01:39:08.377
I know the menu who asked the
question so so is the problem

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16670-1
01:39:08.377 --> 01:39:09.447
formulation clear.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16690-0
01:39:09.717 --> 01:39:14.707
So essentially solution
formulation yeah is not escape.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16675-0
01:39:10.407 --> 01:39:10.607
Yes.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16681-0
01:39:12.827 --> 01:39:13.377
Yes, Sir.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16694-0
01:39:13.467 --> 01:39:13.997
Now it is clear.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16716-0
01:39:14.907 --> 01:39:18.450
So now I need to compute entropy
at every point every level, and

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16716-1
01:39:18.450 --> 01:39:20.847
then I have to see which is the
better one.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16731-0
01:39:21.137 --> 01:39:24.187
So do you want to do it or you
want me to do it?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16737-0
01:39:24.197 --> 01:39:25.657
I can do that.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16744-0
01:39:26.317 --> 01:39:27.487
We have 20 minutes.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16758-0
01:39:27.577 --> 01:39:31.227
I can if there is some other
question, I'll take it.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16762-0
01:39:31.237 --> 01:39:32.957
Otherwise, I'll let me do this.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16782-0
01:39:34.857 --> 01:39:40.007
Because uh, so this is the the
root level 4 by 9 is .44.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16819-0
01:39:40.077 --> 01:39:46.642
I'm approximating that and then
what I'm doing is 4/4 log

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16819-1
01:39:46.642 --> 01:39:53.207
divided by two log equal to
minus, 1.18 OK and so this is

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16819-2
01:39:53.207 --> 01:39:55.017
let me put this.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16830-0
01:40:03.667 --> 01:40:06.397
This is minus 1.18.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16850-0
01:40:20.197 --> 01:40:24.897
And let me do this for let me do
this for the other one.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16855-0
01:40:27.027 --> 01:40:27.617
And I can.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16859-0
01:40:27.627 --> 01:40:28.077
OK, I can.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16878-0
01:40:28.087 --> 01:40:31.747
I will also multiply this with
the four by 9.44 right and that

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16878-1
01:40:31.747 --> 01:40:32.327
will help.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16927-0
01:40:36.067 --> 01:40:40.542
Since we we will have a is is a
more steady calculator allowed

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16917-0
01:40:36.547 --> 01:40:42.707
So this is the calculator allows
and calculate.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16927-1
01:40:40.542 --> 01:40:43.027
scientific calculator in the
exam?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16924-0
01:40:42.717 --> 01:40:44.327
Yes, yes, I think the calculator
is allowed.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16956-0
01:40:44.337 --> 01:40:47.017
Just check the check that
because you have to use the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16956-1
01:40:47.017 --> 01:40:49.746
calculator, otherwise the
machine will be there so the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16956-2
01:40:49.746 --> 01:40:52.127
machine may also have a
calculator within that.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16976-0
01:40:53.057 --> 01:40:56.413
Uh, but, but you you can
calculate if you take a

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16965-0
01:40:53.237 --> 01:40:53.707
OK, OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16976-1
01:40:56.413 --> 01:40:58.877
scientific calculator with you,
OK?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16975-0
01:40:58.067 --> 01:40:58.327
OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/16994-0
01:41:01.227 --> 01:41:06.277
OK, so this is minus .52 and and
I'm doing it.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17037-0
01:41:06.337 --> 01:41:12.240
I I'm remembering .52 and then
I'm doing it for .55 the next

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17037-1
01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:18.337
1.55 is log divided by two log
equal to this and I multiply it

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17037-2
01:41:18.337 --> 01:41:19.207
with .55.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17054-0
01:41:19.837 --> 01:41:23.967
So so now this is one is .52 and
other is .47 right?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17062-0
01:41:24.537 --> 01:41:26.797
So this is equal to .99.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17087-0
01:41:34.977 --> 01:41:41.030
Now let me do it for this this I
know +2 and minus one the +2 and

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17087-1
01:41:41.030 --> 01:41:41.947
minus two.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17093-0
01:41:42.147 --> 01:41:43.867
So the entropy is 1, right?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17103-0
01:41:44.277 --> 01:41:47.667
So let me do it for the others.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17127-0
01:41:47.717 --> 01:41:54.047
So one is this is .4 and .6, so
I have to do it with .4 and .6.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17134-0
01:41:54.057 --> 01:41:55.387
So let me do that.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17140-0
01:41:56.157 --> 01:41:57.487
I'm doing it for attribute 2.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17164-0
01:42:03.167 --> 01:42:09.087
.4 log divided by two log equal
to then then multiplied by .4.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17171-0
01:42:10.227 --> 01:42:11.957
This is equal to 0.53.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17181-0
01:42:12.127 --> 01:42:15.537
OK, so this is .53.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17185-0
01:42:15.547 --> 01:42:16.817
I can keep it in memory.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17195-0
01:42:20.777 --> 01:42:22.957
Then the other one is a .6.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17222-0
01:42:25.947 --> 01:42:33.518
I think it is points point 68.6
log divided by two log

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17222-1
01:42:33.518 --> 01:42:37.097
multiplied by .6 equal to.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17237-0
01:42:39.927 --> 01:42:40.847
.44.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17240-0
01:42:40.857 --> 01:42:44.367
OK, .44 and .53.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17250-0
01:42:49.217 --> 01:42:52.167
So .44 and .53 so.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17267-0
01:42:57.367 --> 01:43:04.467
For food and .53 is going to be
.97, right?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17275-0
01:43:07.357 --> 01:43:09.127
So this is .97.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17280-0
01:43:14.507 --> 01:43:15.287
This is 1.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17294-0
01:43:17.367 --> 01:43:20.897
So so now, now let us do for
this one.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17310-0
01:43:21.327 --> 01:43:26.599
OK, so this is one is 4 and the
other is 5, right, four

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17310-1
01:43:26.599 --> 01:43:27.917
attributes 5K.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17319-0
01:43:32.747 --> 01:43:35.047
So .25 and .75.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17329-0
01:43:54.737 --> 01:43:55.177
Oh, OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17332-0
01:43:55.187 --> 01:43:56.097
This is minus 2.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17334-0
01:43:56.587 --> 01:43:57.237
Understood.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17336-0
01:43:57.507 --> 01:43:58.037
OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17341-0
01:43:58.667 --> 01:44:00.537
And then when you have.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17351-0
01:44:02.127 --> 01:44:03.657
.25 it is.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17359-0
01:44:03.927 --> 01:44:05.967
And then let us do it for .75.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17374-0
01:44:19.337 --> 01:44:23.417
Then multiply it with .75.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17383-0
01:44:26.317 --> 01:44:27.687
This is .31.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17404-0
01:44:27.777 --> 01:44:35.721
OK, so so now what we have is
that this is so this is equal to

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17404-1
01:44:35.721 --> 01:44:36.477
point.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17416-0
01:44:36.747 --> 01:44:42.077
This is 1 by 4, so this is 1 by
4.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17419-0
01:44:42.127 --> 01:44:43.267
So this is equal to.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17438-0
01:44:44.907 --> 01:44:55.337
Ohh this is one by four of two,
so one by four of two is uh .5.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17450-0
01:45:04.767 --> 01:45:08.897
And the other one is .31.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17458-0
01:45:08.907 --> 01:45:10.787
I think I got .75.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17464-0
01:45:10.797 --> 01:45:13.857
What did I get .31 OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17472-0
01:45:16.767 --> 01:45:18.087
So this is .31.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17488-0
01:45:24.197 --> 01:45:27.147
And I have to do this with the
.2 and 2.8.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17490-0
01:45:27.157 --> 01:45:27.567
Same thing.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17504-0
01:45:39.177 --> 01:45:42.947
I'm doing with .2 log divided by
two log.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17512-0
01:45:48.217 --> 01:45:49.477
So I keep this in memory.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17528-0
01:45:52.987 --> 01:45:58.847
Then .8 log so you have to keep
doing the same thing.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17553-0
01:46:02.797 --> 01:46:10.037
OK, one is .26 and other one is
oh point 46.26 and .46.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17559-0
01:46:10.047 --> 01:46:12.317
So that will give .72, right?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17582-0
01:46:23.367 --> 01:46:27.007
So after this split, So what you
have is a .81.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17600-0
01:46:28.197 --> 01:46:37.737
This is 4 by 9 of .81 + 5 by 9
of .72.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17617-0
01:46:40.327 --> 01:46:45.254
So this is equal to
approximately, this is UH-70 so

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17617-1
01:46:45.254 --> 01:46:45.727
nine.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17626-0
01:46:47.037 --> 01:46:50.437
So this will be .77.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17642-0
01:46:51.777 --> 01:46:57.977
So this will be quite no point
76.76.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17649-0
01:46:58.087 --> 01:46:59.097
So now this is.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17654-0
01:46:59.107 --> 01:46:59.997
Let us look at this.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17669-0
01:47:00.007 --> 01:47:07.857
This is 5 * 9 of 97 less 4 by.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17676-0
01:47:09.787 --> 01:47:11.377
Nine of one.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17686-0
01:47:12.007 --> 01:47:15.197
So this is equal to 0.99.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17719-0
01:47:16.637 --> 01:47:23.808
So now you can see that this is
actually 0.98 about .3985

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17719-1
01:47:23.808 --> 01:47:26.157
approximately .985.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17745-0
01:47:26.197 --> 01:47:31.931
So here you can see that the
entropy gain on attribute 2 is

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17745-1
01:47:31.931 --> 01:47:35.657
0.005 and the gain on this one
is .23.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17763-0
01:47:37.287 --> 01:47:42.271
Does that uh, does that clarify
whole thing or or have it

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17763-1
01:47:42.271 --> 01:47:43.817
confused you more?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17781-0
01:47:45.887 --> 01:47:48.347
So attribute one is giving you a
better gain with entropy.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17780-0
01:47:45.977 --> 01:47:46.707
No, Sir. Understood.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17795-0
01:47:50.997 --> 01:47:51.617
Understood, Sir.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17793-0
01:47:51.487 --> 01:47:52.277
Understood, Sir.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17798-0
01:47:52.527 --> 01:47:53.737
OK, OK, alright.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17815-0
01:47:54.207 --> 01:47:59.257
OK, so now we will go with any
other question.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17822-0
01:47:59.327 --> 01:48:01.617
Somebody you wanted for you gain
example, right.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17831-0
01:48:01.787 --> 01:48:04.127
So let me go into the foil gain
example.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17842-0
01:48:08.517 --> 01:48:09.707
So far are you gonna example?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17845-0
01:48:09.717 --> 01:48:10.047
I will.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17851-0
01:48:10.057 --> 01:48:11.667
I'll take the numbers.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17860-0
01:48:11.677 --> 01:48:14.447
So you so the calculations.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17872-0
01:48:14.457 --> 01:48:22.077
So suppose that we have 200
training tuples out of them.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17876-0
01:48:22.117 --> 01:48:23.277
100 are positive.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17886-0
01:48:26.057 --> 01:48:27.467
Or maybe I should make?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17910-0
01:48:27.477 --> 01:48:33.618
I think you you want so 200 or
negative and 100 or positive 300

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17910-1
01:48:33.618 --> 01:48:37.167
training tuples and then the
Rule 1.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17945-0
01:48:38.977 --> 01:48:43.926
Let's say is selecting uh based
on the predicates it is

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17945-1
01:48:43.926 --> 01:48:49.492
selecting 50 tuples and out of
them 30 are positive and 20 are

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17945-2
01:48:49.492 --> 01:48:50.287
negative.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17957-0
01:48:50.517 --> 01:48:52.827
So what is the foil gain that we
are getting?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17965-0
01:48:53.197 --> 01:48:55.457
So the foil gain for Rule 1.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/17975-0
01:49:03.117 --> 01:49:04.827
Is equal to 50.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18013-0
01:49:05.017 --> 01:49:09.067
Sorry 30, because the rule is
for positive tuples, so

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18013-1
01:49:09.067 --> 01:49:13.192
essentially the rule is for
positive tuples, so we are

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18013-2
01:49:13.192 --> 01:49:17.467
taking the positives, so 30
multiplied by log 230 by 50.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18021-0
01:49:19.647 --> 01:49:23.977
Minus log 200 by 300.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18029-0
01:49:26.337 --> 01:49:27.887
Or does that help?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18043-0
01:49:27.937 --> 01:49:31.870
Or do you need some mood
clarification on foil gain

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18043-1
01:49:31.870 --> 01:49:32.777
calculation?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18052-0
01:49:33.857 --> 01:49:35.047
I do not know who has asked.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18061-0
01:49:35.057 --> 01:49:35.647
I forgot the name.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18062-0
01:49:36.017 --> 01:49:37.377
Yeah, it helps.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18093-0
01:49:39.967 --> 01:49:43.830
Is it clear or something more
needs to be somebody posted a

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18086-0
01:49:42.587 --> 01:49:43.487
Yeah, it's been.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18093-1
01:49:43.830 --> 01:49:44.667
chat message.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18109-0
01:49:45.877 --> 01:49:47.197
Can you go back to slides?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18104-0
01:49:46.367 --> 01:49:47.817
Then you go back to slides.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18113-0
01:49:48.347 --> 01:49:49.687
Yeah, I go back to the slide.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18116-0
01:49:49.727 --> 01:49:50.097
OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18120-0
01:49:50.187 --> 01:49:51.667
OK, Mr B's.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18123-0
01:49:51.677 --> 01:49:52.287
Yes, go ahead.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18141-0
01:49:59.747 --> 01:50:02.217
Sutter, how you took the second
part.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18142-0
01:50:00.247 --> 01:50:02.707
Center how you took the second
part.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18174-0
01:50:04.737 --> 01:50:09.927
For rule one, you have taken,
uh, divided from the film.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18186-0
01:50:04.877 --> 01:50:10.582
The project one you have taken,
uh 100 by 300 from the 200 you

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18186-1
01:50:10.582 --> 01:50:13.117
are asking about 100 by 300.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18188-0
01:50:13.127 --> 01:50:13.547
Is it right?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18190-0
01:50:14.057 --> 01:50:14.617
Right, right.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18191-0
01:50:14.577 --> 01:50:15.117
Right. Right.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18223-0
01:50:17.477 --> 01:50:22.713
Ohh 100 by 300 is because the
test training data has got 300

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18223-1
01:50:22.713 --> 01:50:27.347
tuples and then 100 or positive
and 200 are negative.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18229-0
01:50:30.697 --> 01:50:31.017
OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18230-0
01:50:31.217 --> 01:50:32.657
OK. OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18234-0
01:50:32.727 --> 01:50:32.897
Yeah.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18238-0
01:50:34.167 --> 01:50:36.057
I'm Mr Durai Rajan.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18261-0
01:50:36.067 --> 01:50:39.563
You are saying that give me a
sample question paper that looks

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18261-1
01:50:39.563 --> 01:50:42.337
more like a question paper that
is going to come.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18329-0
01:50:42.407 --> 01:50:46.796
We have not yet set the question
paper and that is that we will

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18329-1
01:50:46.796 --> 01:50:51.185
not accept as a request because
that will defeat the purpose of

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18329-2
01:50:51.185 --> 01:50:55.094
learning, so we would rather
want you to learn the whole

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18296-0
01:50:52.367 --> 01:50:52.647
But no.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18310-0
01:50:52.657 --> 01:50:54.097
No, like instead of.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18329-3
01:50:55.094 --> 01:50:59.140
thing and get 10 marks rather
than learn only the question

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18329-4
01:50:59.140 --> 01:51:00.717
paper and get 30 marks.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18339-0
01:51:00.727 --> 01:51:03.797
That is not something that bits
will encourage.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18342-0
01:51:05.187 --> 01:51:05.477
Are you?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18358-0
01:51:05.487 --> 01:51:05.997
Last night.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18359-0
01:51:05.487 --> 01:51:06.517
You got me wrong, Sir.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18356-0
01:51:05.677 --> 01:51:06.717
Hey, you got me wrong.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18370-0
01:51:06.727 --> 01:51:07.537
Set actually.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18421-0
01:51:08.247 --> 01:51:10.811
Actually The thing is you said
like the previous year Question

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18412-0
01:51:08.747 --> 01:51:11.286
Actually The thing is you said
like the previous year Question

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18421-1
01:51:10.811 --> 01:51:12.357
paper might not be of any use,
right?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18412-1
01:51:11.286 --> 01:51:12.817
paper might not be of any use,
right?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18416-0
01:51:12.827 --> 01:51:12.957
No.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18454-0
01:51:12.967 --> 01:51:15.853
In fact, even the model Question
Paper that I posted sample

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18454-1
01:51:15.853 --> 01:51:19.026
Question Paper may not be of any
use, because that is what I said

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18449-0
01:51:17.777 --> 01:51:18.257
OK then.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18454-2
01:51:19.026 --> 01:51:20.757
come with no warranty or
guarantee.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18472-0
01:51:20.927 --> 01:51:22.797
So you please learn on your own.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18461-0
01:51:21.497 --> 01:51:21.977
OK, fine.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18468-0
01:51:21.987 --> 01:51:22.267
Thank you.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18475-0
01:51:23.147 --> 01:51:23.377
OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18470-0
01:51:23.807 --> 01:51:24.057
Yeah.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18495-0
01:51:24.067 --> 01:51:26.717
And and I there was one more
question on calculator.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18477-0
01:51:24.317 --> 01:51:24.547
Yeah.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18500-0
01:51:24.557 --> 01:51:27.227
And and I there was one more
question on calculator.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18511-0
01:51:26.727 --> 01:51:28.647
Which type of calculator we can
use?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18512-0
01:51:27.237 --> 01:51:29.177
Which type of calculator we can
use?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18548-0
01:51:30.917 --> 01:51:35.130
I think scientific calculator
you can take and that is what,

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18548-1
01:51:35.130 --> 01:51:39.343
because at least in the past, no
student ever has complained

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18548-2
01:51:39.343 --> 01:51:41.967
about the restrictions on
calculator.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18558-0
01:51:42.417 --> 01:51:44.467
So I think there are no
restrictions.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18585-0
01:51:44.477 --> 01:51:48.552
So is there anything if I do not
think that the calculator is

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18585-1
01:51:48.552 --> 01:51:52.627
allowed so they will not check
what type of calculator it is?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18598-0
01:51:53.237 --> 01:51:54.697
Is that the question or

01:52:14.507 --> 01:52:15.847
Can you mute yourself, please?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18720-0

Just one minute.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18728-0
01:52:16.497 --> 01:52:18.867
I'm muting everybody for just
for one minute.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18734-0
01:52:19.397 --> 01:52:20.427
Going to unmute everybody.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18745-0
01:52:22.007 --> 01:52:25.597
OK, because it is, it is echoing
my voice.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18761-0
01:52:25.607 --> 01:52:31.789
So see the point is you please
read the examination instructors

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18761-1
01:52:31.789 --> 01:52:33.237
very carefully.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18787-0
01:52:33.387 --> 01:52:36.800
No, no, there can be no class
next week, Mr Mittal, because

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18787-1
01:52:36.800 --> 01:52:39.927
next week you're going to have
one of the exams right?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18791-0
01:52:41.247 --> 01:52:41.817
So.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18829-0
01:52:41.827 --> 01:52:45.283
So the point is when you you
please study the whatever

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18829-1
01:52:45.283 --> 01:52:48.802
document that they give you the
examination regulations

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18829-2
01:52:48.802 --> 01:52:52.572
carefully why I'm saying this is
that because I will not be

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18829-3
01:52:52.572 --> 01:52:54.457
present in examination center.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18879-0
01:52:54.467 --> 01:52:58.186
In fact, it's going to happen in
multiple examination center and

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18879-1
01:52:58.186 --> 01:53:01.732
really the Proctor is going to
be and then the whoever is the

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18879-2
01:53:01.732 --> 01:53:05.336
in charge is going to be really
taking a call and they will be

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18879-3
01:53:05.336 --> 01:53:08.367
going with the document that has
been given to them.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18927-0
01:53:09.197 --> 01:53:12.675
So my interpretation may have a
lesser weight compared to

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18927-1
01:53:12.675 --> 01:53:16.512
because the calculators I know
that there was no restriction on

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18927-2
01:53:16.512 --> 01:53:20.289
calculator but in the but in the
statement I do not think that

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18927-3
01:53:20.289 --> 01:53:22.327
they have put any restriction
in.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18978-0
01:53:22.397 --> 01:53:27.089
So please stay it I have not
seen any problem with that, but

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18978-1
01:53:27.089 --> 01:53:31.858
otherwise the whatever things
have been mentioned in the rule

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18978-2
01:53:31.858 --> 01:53:35.627
book, so it is the
interpretation of the Proctor

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18978-3
01:53:35.627 --> 01:53:40.087
that finally determines whether
accepted or not accepted.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18981-0
01:53:41.397 --> 01:53:42.737
I'm unmuting everybody.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18991-0
01:53:50.617 --> 01:53:51.257
Yeah.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19024-0
01:53:51.297 --> 01:53:55.700
I I I just would like to ask
you, can you please provide us a

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/18997-0
01:53:51.777 --> 01:53:52.177
Prison.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19023-0
01:53:53.707 --> 01:53:57.047
I just would like to ask you,
your provider and prepare.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19024-1
01:53:55.700 --> 01:53:57.617
previous error question to?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19036-0
01:54:03.997 --> 01:54:05.367
I am unable to understand.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19037-0
01:54:04.697 --> 01:54:06.437
I am unable to understand it.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19060-0
01:54:08.867 --> 01:54:12.207
So can you please provide us
with previous year question

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19065-0
01:54:09.707 --> 01:54:13.797
Maybe English provider you're
pushing pushing?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19060-1
01:54:12.207 --> 01:54:12.617
papers?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19064-0
01:54:12.627 --> 01:54:13.587
The old question papers.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19082-0
01:54:16.757 --> 01:54:17.897
Old question paper.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19080-0
01:54:17.617 --> 01:54:18.767
Board question paper.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19103-0
01:54:19.057 --> 01:54:21.667
OK, let me you like the right
fine.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19091-0
01:54:19.227 --> 01:54:20.837
Learn very fine.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19139-0
01:54:20.847 --> 01:54:26.157
I need to check with the faculty
who has taken taken and once.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19119-0
01:54:21.677 --> 01:54:23.297
I need to check with the fact I
need.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19133-0
01:54:23.477 --> 01:54:25.347
Let's take yeah, just two years.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19138-0
01:54:27.117 --> 01:54:29.257
We can practice them actually
and then.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19178-0
01:54:34.207 --> 01:54:37.253
But I don't encourage because
the simple reason is that they

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19159-0
01:54:34.917 --> 01:54:35.577
What are you doing?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19178-1
01:54:37.253 --> 01:54:40.349
may not have covered it exactly
the way we do, because we set

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19178-2
01:54:40.349 --> 01:54:41.297
the question paper.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19191-0
01:54:41.337 --> 01:54:44.535
Presently, the whoever faculty,
are they, they do it based on

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19191-1
01:54:44.535 --> 01:54:45.257
their comfort.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19202-0
01:54:45.887 --> 01:54:49.165
So because asking for more
question papers is not really

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19202-1
01:54:49.165 --> 01:54:49.797
encouraged.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19208-0
01:55:01.577 --> 01:55:01.897
OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19217-0
01:55:01.907 --> 01:55:05.477
Exact when you location is not
available OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19237-0
01:55:13.697 --> 01:55:15.087
Avengers are just window.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19226-0
01:55:14.187 --> 01:55:14.387
OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19234-0
01:55:14.397 --> 01:55:14.877
Thank you, Sir.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19242-0
01:55:14.887 --> 01:55:15.697
Just doing now.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19244-0
01:55:17.317 --> 01:55:17.697
Go ahead.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19256-0
01:55:18.857 --> 01:55:20.447
That help.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19265-0
01:55:19.187 --> 01:55:21.767
Uh detector in topical kissing
your date with?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19262-0
01:55:20.457 --> 01:55:21.107
Listen, you did.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19276-0
01:55:23.047 --> 01:55:23.847
Can you repeat again?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19271-0
01:55:23.527 --> 01:55:23.747
Uh.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19317-0
01:55:24.867 --> 01:55:31.642
Other entropical for the store
you did I somehow it was very

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19289-0
01:55:25.347 --> 01:55:26.597
Other in tropical?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19300-0
01:55:26.827 --> 01:55:28.387
Yeah, entropy calculation. Yes.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19306-0
01:55:28.397 --> 01:55:28.657
Yes.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19340-0
01:55:28.707 --> 01:55:34.687
Umm I somehow it was good, but
there was, you know, and back

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19317-1
01:55:31.642 --> 01:55:32.197
work.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19346-0
01:55:32.207 --> 01:55:36.997
Here was, you know, and back and
forth so to understand.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19340-1
01:55:34.687 --> 01:55:35.667
and forth.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19342-0
01:55:37.127 --> 01:55:37.767
Understand.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19344-0
01:55:37.967 --> 01:55:38.307
OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19359-0
01:55:38.317 --> 01:55:41.787
OK, I'll write the formula so
see the point is I will.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19366-0
01:55:41.767 --> 01:55:41.927
Yeah.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19369-0
01:55:41.797 --> 01:55:43.747
I will write the formula that I
have used.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19395-0
01:55:43.877 --> 01:55:48.849
So what I'm going to do is that
suppose I take the same thing,

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19377-0
01:55:44.317 --> 01:55:44.497
Yeah.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19395-1
01:55:48.849 --> 01:55:51.847
I'm going to put it in another
slide.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19401-0
01:55:52.457 --> 01:55:54.627
So I'm going to.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19409-0
01:55:54.817 --> 01:55:56.957
OK so here I'm going to paste
it.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19436-0
01:55:59.657 --> 01:56:06.367
OK, so now now the problem is
that first OK so let me so here.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19424-0
01:56:00.137 --> 01:56:00.947
It is become very.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19446-0
01:56:06.817 --> 01:56:10.387
The point is that the training
data has got 9 tuples.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19461-0
01:56:14.957 --> 01:56:20.297
9 tuples out of them, 4 positive
and five negatives.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19498-0
01:56:20.407 --> 01:56:28.886
So entropy at the top is with
the training data is 4 by 9

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19498-1
01:56:28.886 --> 01:56:36.487
minus of 4 by 9, log 24 by 9 + 5
by 9, log 25 by 9.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19507-0
01:56:37.747 --> 01:56:39.837
OK, so now let us split.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19523-0
01:56:40.067 --> 01:56:45.597
So let us split A1 into true and
false right.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19542-0
01:56:46.137 --> 01:56:53.626
A1 is true and false, so when it
is 3 and three plus and 1 minus

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19542-1
01:56:53.626 --> 01:56:54.317
right.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19563-0
01:56:54.407 --> 01:57:03.120
So the entropy with yeah V1 is
equal to true is equal to is

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19563-1
01:57:03.120 --> 01:57:05.007
equal to the.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19582-0
01:57:06.717 --> 01:57:18.967
Minus 3 by 4, log 23 by 4 + 1 by
4, log 21 by 4.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19587-0
01:57:26.477 --> 01:57:28.937
OK, similarly entropy of.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19607-0
01:57:33.977 --> 01:57:39.548
This is going to be 1 positive
and four negative right for

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19607-1
01:57:39.548 --> 01:57:40.397
negative.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19613-0
01:57:40.407 --> 01:57:44.497
This is equal to minus of uh.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19619-0
01:57:44.507 --> 01:57:47.307
This is uh, 1 by 5.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19626-0
01:57:49.457 --> 01:57:51.807
Log 21 by 5 plus.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19663-0
01:57:58.307 --> 01:58:03.441
Ohh 4 by 5 and then once you get
this So what you need to do is

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19663-1
01:58:03.441 --> 01:58:05.847
that entropy of end similarly.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19665-0
01:58:06.057 --> 01:58:08.537
So you got for entropy of on
using.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19679-0
01:58:09.357 --> 01:58:13.753
Uh, so you got the entropy for
this site and entropy for this

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19679-1
01:58:13.753 --> 01:58:14.107
site.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19695-0
01:58:14.197 --> 01:58:19.967
So entropy of EA1 split is equal
to.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19704-0
01:58:20.207 --> 01:58:22.527
So this let us call it as E one.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19723-0
01:58:22.697 --> 01:58:26.967
Let us call this as E2, so
entropy with a one each.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19755-0
01:58:27.197 --> 01:58:33.867
So at the top we have 4 tuples
and in this case 5 tuples, so 4

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19755-1
01:58:33.867 --> 01:58:36.937
by 9 of key 1 + 5 by 9 of E2.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19766-0
01:58:41.827 --> 01:58:43.957
So does that explain?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19772-0
01:58:43.737 --> 01:58:44.227
Yeah.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19774-0
01:58:44.297 --> 01:58:45.317
Yeah, yes.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19770-0
01:58:44.317 --> 01:58:45.177
Yeah.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19783-0
01:58:45.527 --> 01:58:47.857
Yes, that explains clearly
right.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19821-0
01:58:46.997 --> 01:58:52.912
So this we have done for even
really we have to do for like

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19809-0
01:58:48.127 --> 01:58:51.837
We have that for even same thing
we have to do for a two also.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19818-0
01:58:51.847 --> 01:58:52.357
Yeah, right.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19828-0
01:58:52.737 --> 01:58:53.587
Parking lot.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19821-1
01:58:52.912 --> 01:58:53.897
God thank.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19825-0
01:58:53.907 --> 01:58:54.207
Thank you.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19830-0
01:58:54.057 --> 01:58:54.427
Thank.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19835-0
01:58:54.247 --> 01:58:54.597
And kisses.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19836-0
01:58:54.437 --> 01:58:55.507
Thank you. Yeah.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19887-0
01:59:01.747 --> 01:59:08.846
So the first we do the camera or
each attribute or that will

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19878-0
01:59:02.037 --> 01:59:04.747
OK, I think that yes, Mr Kumar.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19888-0
01:59:05.107 --> 01:59:09.747
But for enter tribute or that
yes, we have to do it for all

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19887-1
01:59:08.846 --> 01:59:09.427
work.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19888-1
01:59:09.747 --> 01:59:10.907
the attributes.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19908-0
01:59:10.917 --> 01:59:13.887
So for the attribute one only in
this slide it is done.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19925-0
01:59:14.157 --> 01:59:15.207
So you have to do the same.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19919-0
01:59:14.227 --> 01:59:14.617
No, no.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19939-0
01:59:14.627 --> 01:59:21.887
I mean, OK and the you entropy 4
by 5 nine.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19953-0
01:59:16.347 --> 01:59:26.257
Yes, yes, you entropy I4 by 8
next 4 by 9 + 5 five.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19952-0
01:59:23.417 --> 01:59:25.787
4 by 9 + 5 I.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19969-0
01:59:28.607 --> 01:59:33.327
Ah, yes, you've we need to
calculate the uh so can you.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/19975-0
01:59:33.337 --> 01:59:35.207
Can you tell me what is the?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20002-0
01:59:35.477 --> 01:59:39.776
Because when we do the entropy
on A1, So what is happening is

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20002-1
01:59:39.776 --> 01:59:41.717
that let me put it this way.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20011-0
01:59:41.767 --> 01:59:44.277
When you look at a decision
tree, uh.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20053-0
01:59:44.347 --> 01:59:49.287
Egg the root node at the root
node we have 9 tuples and when

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20053-1
01:59:49.287 --> 01:59:54.630
we split using A1 so we ended up
with four tuples on one side and

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20053-2
01:59:54.630 --> 01:59:56.897
five tuples on another side.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20076-0
01:59:57.007 --> 02:00:01.357
So there is a even associated
with one and then E2 and then

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20076-1
02:00:01.357 --> 02:00:02.807
the overall entropy.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20093-0
02:00:02.817 --> 02:00:05.117
We have to do it as a weighted
sum of these two.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20099-0
02:00:05.647 --> 02:00:07.037
Is that the question or
something else?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20111-0
02:00:09.867 --> 02:00:10.637
Yes, Sir. Same.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20175-0
02:00:10.367 --> 02:00:13.973
Yes, I've seen so that is why
you need to do this when EE for

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20175-1
02:00:13.973 --> 02:00:17.696
a one you need to do it this way
and similarly you for you have

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20175-2
02:00:17.696 --> 02:00:21.243
to do it for E to E for A2,
whatever is the division that is

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20175-3
02:00:21.243 --> 02:00:24.907
happening and for each division
uh attribute 2 may be dividing

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20175-4
02:00:24.907 --> 02:00:27.117
it in using whatever number of
times.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20201-0
02:00:27.127 --> 02:00:30.843
In this case, I think it is
again 54 only, but then it can

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20201-1
02:00:30.843 --> 02:00:31.787
be 637 to also.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20228-0
02:00:31.797 --> 02:00:36.368
Then for each a packet, you need
to compute entropy and then you

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20228-1
02:00:36.368 --> 02:00:40.164
sum up the entropy for all the
paths using a weighted

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20228-2
02:00:40.164 --> 02:00:40.867
summation.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20259-0
02:00:50.057 --> 02:00:54.077
That all said, could you please
tell we we have cheese square?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20252-0
02:00:50.547 --> 02:00:52.117
But it also could you please
tell?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20271-0
02:00:53.387 --> 02:00:55.997
Maybe it is square test milk
method?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20285-0
02:00:54.087 --> 02:00:58.077
Yes, the third we apply any
example for them.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20276-0
02:00:56.007 --> 02:00:56.347
We apply.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20299-0
02:00:57.627 --> 02:01:00.237
They can you use Skype, Square
test, Chi square test.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20302-0
02:01:00.047 --> 02:01:01.317
Guys, various guys well.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20304-0
02:01:00.247 --> 02:01:02.587
You use Chi square test.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20326-0
02:01:02.597 --> 02:01:06.769
You use when you have relation
between 2 nominal attributes, so

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20326-1
02:01:06.769 --> 02:01:09.637
you need to think about nominal
attributes.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20361-0
02:01:09.997 --> 02:01:13.787
So the two nominal attributes
for which you know that whether

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20361-1
02:01:13.787 --> 02:01:17.699
they are correlated or not and
how strongly related essentially

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20361-2
02:01:17.699 --> 02:01:19.777
that is what it is going to
tell.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20374-0
02:01:22.227 --> 02:01:25.577
Does that clarify or yes, yes,
OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20373-0
02:01:23.777 --> 02:01:24.537
Yes, yes, yes.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20400-0
02:01:48.687 --> 02:01:53.677
So anything else that any other
question that I can answer?

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20407-0
02:01:56.037 --> 02:01:56.297
OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20416-0
02:01:56.307 --> 02:02:00.547
If there are no questions, we
can close the session so.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20472-0
02:02:04.057 --> 02:02:10.827
Uh said if we have said, if we
have any question by next week.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20474-0
02:02:04.537 --> 02:02:10.337
Uh, so say if we have, if we
have any question, yes, fine

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20457-0
02:02:04.587 --> 02:02:06.887
So please upload this slide
today.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20442-0
02:02:04.997 --> 02:02:05.457
Thank you.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20474-1
02:02:10.337 --> 02:02:11.337
next week.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20477-0
02:02:11.557 --> 02:02:12.147
Uh.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20494-0
02:02:12.337 --> 02:02:14.747
Ohh, because next week we have
exams.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20491-0
02:02:12.827 --> 02:02:15.407
Only because next week we have
exact.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20497-0
02:02:15.507 --> 02:02:16.937
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20506-0
02:02:16.697 --> 02:02:16.947
So.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20523-0
02:02:17.007 --> 02:02:22.054
So if if you have questions, I
will be looking at canvas more

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20523-1
02:02:22.054 --> 02:02:23.437
and answering it.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20553-0
02:02:23.447 --> 02:02:26.708
If something that is clear,
there is somebody who's asking

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20553-1
02:02:26.708 --> 02:02:30.080
about the center and all that
that I could not answer, there

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20553-2
02:02:30.080 --> 02:02:30.687
is nothing.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20586-0
02:02:30.697 --> 02:02:34.226
But if this is technical
question, I'll try to answer

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20586-1

02:02:39.987 --> 02:02:42.705
If you keep it to the last day,
then I may not be able to catch

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20602-1
02:02:42.705 --> 02:02:43.087

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20607-0

OK, Sir.

02:02:45.217 --> 02:02:45.717
OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20617-0

Thank you.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20615-0

Yeah.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20636-0

my mail ID also on the canvas

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20636-1
02:02:50.293 --> 02:02:50.557
site.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20685-0
02:02:50.567 --> 02:02:54.535

you can post it in canvas and

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20685-1

send me a reminder saying that I
have posted a question in canvas

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20685-2
02:02:58.758 --> 02:03:02.598
and waiting for the answer
something, but try to do it next

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20685-3
02:03:02.598 --> 02:03:03.877
Wednesday, Thursday.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20692-0
02:03:03.887 --> 02:03:06.037
Don't keep it for Saturday or
Friday.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20695-0
02:03:09.027 --> 02:03:09.597
OK.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20702-0
02:03:09.687 --> 02:03:11.947
And what more, OK, so.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20703-0

OK so.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20760-0

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20727-0
02:03:33.267 --> 02:03:35.607
But he assignment grounded on
softer makes a mistake.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20760-1
02:03:37.603 --> 02:03:39.077
syllabus is a miss.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20755-0
02:03:37.897 --> 02:03:39.397
It is this singular segmenter.

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20784-0
02:03:38.577 --> 02:03:41.149
And the syllabus user mispriced
with the syllable syllable thing

effd445c-238b-4ea8-bedc-f98fd2f4cf3a/20783-0
02:03:39.087 --> 02:03:41.295
