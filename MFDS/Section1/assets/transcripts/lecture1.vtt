00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.415
This is general to mathematical
foundational machine learning

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/723-1
00:02:24.415 --> 00:02:26.260
and mathematical foundation for
data science.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/745-0
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.460
I have put up here and we will
whenever you have some doubt,

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/745-1
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.040

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.060
Now the third one is the yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/785-0
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.440
Uh, a small sorry, a small doubt
in the declaration form.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/792-0
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.070
So we need to print.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/801-0
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.650
Yeah, we need to print a.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.480
We need to print and uh, just uh
sign and or entire content.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/838-0
00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.820
We need to write in the
handwriting.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/835-0
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:54.850
It is better.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/862-0
00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.784
Yeah, it is better that you do
that, but in case you are

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/862-1
00:02:58.784 --> 00:03:01.280
falling short of time, then you
can.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/882-0

The other contents can be as it
is, and then you can sign and

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/894-0
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:06.090

OK, now the purpose of this
course is to make you a little

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/955-1
00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.729
familiar with the mathematical
concepts you are going to use in

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/955-2
00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:20.120

important for the later part of
the course which is going to

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/994-2
00:03:26.588 --> 00:03:27.780

You can just read through that
and ask me if there are any

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1185-1
00:04:04.712 --> 00:04:07.744
doubts there, but the important
part is I'm going to cover

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1185-2
00:04:07.744 --> 00:04:10.879
something on the course handout
stuff, so we are going to do

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1185-3
00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:11.650
something like.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1204-0
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.105
Umm, the first thing we are
going to do is this gradient

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1204-1
00:04:17.105 --> 00:04:18.110
descent method.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1221-0
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:21.940
I'm going to talk about linear
regression model in detail, tell

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1221-1
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.000
you the mathematical.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1229-0
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.290
Basis for those methods.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1287-0
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.739
And then we are going to go to
principal component analysis

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1287-1
00:04:29.739 --> 00:04:33.280
also called as a PCA and he will
do in depth discussion about PCA

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1287-2
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.606
probably will take a real time
example and then I will try to

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1287-3
00:04:36.606 --> 00:04:38.860
show you how effective those
methods are.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1314-0
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.668
But even in gradient descent
methods, they are going to spend

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1314-1
00:04:41.668 --> 00:04:43.602
a little bit of time in
understanding the vanilla

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1314-2
00:04:43.602 --> 00:04:44.260
gradient descent.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1319-0
00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.850
Then we do the mini batch.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1353-0
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.651
Yeah, if you're not speaking,
can you put your systems on mute

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1353-1
00:04:51.651 --> 00:04:54.360
and whenever you have a question
you can unmute and speak.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1366-0
00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.486
So stochastic gradient method
and and then mini batch gradient

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1366-1
00:05:00.486 --> 00:05:01.550
descent method.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1380-0
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.180
So these are the three things we
are going to cover.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1398-0
00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.124
And finally, we'll talk about
support vector machine, the

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1398-1
00:05:06.124 --> 00:05:08.300
mathematics behind support
vector machine.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1419-0
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.007
So we are going to do a bit of
nonlinear, quite a bit of

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1419-1
00:05:12.007 --> 00:05:13.500
nonlinear optimization.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1458-0
00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.706
I think that is a core of what
we are going to do in this this

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1458-1
00:05:17.706 --> 00:05:21.473
course, but to prepare you for
that, the 1st 6-7 LECTURES will

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1458-2
00:05:21.473 --> 00:05:22.310
be on general.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1466-0
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.910
Debra and I had already posted
LECTURES.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1475-0
00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.040
You know, these are the
preliminaries.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1534-0
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.681
I hope you know all of you know
about this lecture 0 and the

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1534-1
00:05:29.681 --> 00:05:33.313
contents there, but still for
completeness sake I had put it

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1534-2
00:05:33.313 --> 00:05:37.182
up so that it is helpful for you
for coming prepared for today's

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1534-3
00:05:37.182 --> 00:05:40.100
class in case there is a need
for me to do that.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1562-0
00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.667
You just tell me the areas I
will touch upon that now the

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1562-1
00:05:43.667 --> 00:05:46.550
course handout in a in a very
detailed manner.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1584-0
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.604
It tells what is the textbook
I'm going to follow and how this

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1584-1
00:05:49.604 --> 00:05:51.730
is going to be managed in the
model itself.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1608-0
00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.600
Important things in the
evaluation front are something

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1608-1
00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.870
like you have two assignments, 3
quizzes, 2 assignments.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1653-0
00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.621
These are 1010 and we have given
the date and time so we strictly

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1653-1
00:06:04.621 --> 00:06:08.305
follow this and the declaration
somebody was asking about saying

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1653-2
00:06:08.305 --> 00:06:11.310
that you will not ask me for any
extension etcetera.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1686-0
00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.812
You see, because very difficult
to manage this group if people

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1686-1
00:06:14.812 --> 00:06:17.815
keep asking for extension and it
it for it overlaps with some

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1686-2
00:06:17.815 --> 00:06:18.930
other course and so on.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1698-0
00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.660
So we'll strictly adhere to
these days dates.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1716-0
00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.200
So you can make a note of it in
your calendar right now.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1724-0
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:25.250
So we have put it up.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1744-0
00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.152
You can download this document
also and then you can have it

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1744-1
00:06:28.152 --> 00:06:29.290
for future reference it.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1761-0
00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.708
There are three quizzes, but
we'll take the best two out of

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1761-1
00:06:32.708 --> 00:06:33.170
the three.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1789-0
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.026
So in case you are absent for
quiz one for some reason you can

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1789-1
00:06:37.026 --> 00:06:38.450
take quiz two and quiz 3.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1800-0
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.740
The same thing goes to quiz two
and quiz three.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1814-0
00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.800
So best two out of the three,
that is what we will consider.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1829-0
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:47.320
There is no necessity for you to
write 3.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1846-0
00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:50.565
If you say I am OK with two,
then we will take the the two

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1846-1
00:06:50.565 --> 00:06:51.170
out of that.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1880-0
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.003
OK, mid semester exam is going
to be a close book for two hours

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1880-1
00:06:56.003 --> 00:07:00.007
and it'll have a vintage of 30%
comprehensive exam will be open

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1880-2
00:07:00.007 --> 00:07:00.320
book.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1900-0
00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.290
It is for 2 1/2 hours and it
will be a uh.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1909-0
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.870
It'll be on both of them.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1911-0
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:05.480
Will be online.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1916-0
00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:06.820
Take care.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1948-0
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:10.638
So for the mid semester, we'll
have everything covered between

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1948-1
00:07:10.638 --> 00:07:13.480
weeks one and eight and for the
comprehensive.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1952-0
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.740
That both will be they're both
will be.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1957-0
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.350
Usually it was open book.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1963-0
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:17.860
Right, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1976-0
00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:19.500
Is it close books at the museum?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1985-0
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:22.320
No, I said mid semester is close
book.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1998-0
00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:23.140
That's what is written here.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/1994-0
00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:24.100
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2004-0
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.550
OK. Thanks.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2008-0
00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:25.520
Are you able to see my screen?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2015-0
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:26.990
Is it?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2039-0
00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.252
OK, so mid semester is going to
be a closed book examination and

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2039-1
00:07:30.252 --> 00:07:32.620
cooperating exam is going to be
an open book examination.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2057-0
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:37.160
Sir, can you zoom the zoom the
document a little bit?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2050-0
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:34.740
And.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2053-0
00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:35.010
Uh.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2068-0
00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:38.860
We can't see the what is written
there.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2072-0
00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.170
So is he.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2081-0
00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.070
My point is I can't zoom this
any further.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2102-0
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:48.965
Yeah, may request you to go to
that Web page canvas page and

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2102-1
00:07:48.965 --> 00:07:49.720
see this.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2122-0
00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.280
Actually in teams you can zoom
and and and look at if you want.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2116-0
00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:52.420
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2159-0
00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:58.664
So yeah, so said, uh, coming
back to this open book, we had

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2130-0
00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:55.570
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2159-1
00:07:58.664 --> 00:08:02.179
two LECTURES already and one of
them mentioned that we are

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2159-2
00:08:02.179 --> 00:08:04.860
allowed only proper books for
the open book.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2180-0
00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:08.924
The other teacher told us that
our handwritten note also can be

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2180-1
00:08:08.924 --> 00:08:11.160
carried out for the open book
exam.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2192-0
00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:12.750
Yeah, I found the open book.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2200-0
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:12.770
So what is in your case?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2196-0
00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:13.390
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2221-0
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.509
So so the for any open book
examination, we'll have the

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2221-1
00:08:16.509 --> 00:08:19.840
preferred, the the prescribed
textbook and reference books.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2226-0
00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:20.770
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2242-0
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:23.778
No solution manual, but you can
carry your handwritten notes

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2242-1
00:08:23.778 --> 00:08:25.760
there, but it should not be
loose pages.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2251-0
00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:26.890
It should be a bone book.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2252-0
00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:28.700
OK, OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2259-0
00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:29.750
And these people, it is.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2276-0
00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.080
Whatever you will be teaching in
the class, those without.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2278-0
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:31.360
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2280-0
00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:31.790
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2282-0
00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:32.230
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2291-0
00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:32.730
Also we can do.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2288-0
00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2296-0
00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:33.930
There it can be used.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2294-0
00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:35.360
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2302-0
00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:35.870
Thank you, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2308-0
00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:36.740
Take care.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2306-0
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:37.870
Venkat, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2311-0
00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.120
Just one confirmation.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2318-0
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:39.830
Yeah, yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2326-0
00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:42.400
Uh, this is the mid semester
exam which is closed.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2331-0
00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:43.790
Book can be done online, right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2334-0
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:44.830
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2335-0
00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:46.450
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2338-0
00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:46.890
Thank you.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2341-0
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:47.260
That's it.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2342-0
00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:47.870
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2369-0
00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:53.237
So that you will get the
detailed information about all

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2369-1
00:08:53.237 --> 00:08:56.100
these things in the in the in an
email.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2374-0
00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:56.960
So don't worry.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2396-0
00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:59.315
I mean, you will not miss any
information and I'll keep

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2396-1
00:08:59.315 --> 00:09:00.530
reminding about these things.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2451-0
00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:05.478
OK, So what I'm going to use is
I I'm going to follow a little

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2408-0
00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:02.260
Uh, the.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2451-1
00:09:05.478 --> 00:09:09.291
programmatic approach in in, in,
in in solving the things in

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2451-2
00:09:09.291 --> 00:09:13.166
linear algebra I will do the
theoretical things the proofs et

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2451-3
00:09:13.166 --> 00:09:16.980
cetera to to have a very formal
introduction to the subject.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2461-0
00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:18.970
But I'll use an interface called
Octave.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2467-0
00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:20.980
This is an octave interface.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2480-0
00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:23.490
You can you can make a note of
it.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2504-0
00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:27.096
I've also write it down and you
can use octave for linear

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2504-1
00:09:27.096 --> 00:09:31.002
algebra and other companies is
free across multiple platforms,

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2504-2
00:09:31.002 --> 00:09:31.870
Windows, Unix.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2516-0
00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:34.600
I hope it is there for Mac also.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2534-0
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:38.274
So you can download it and keep
it, and whenever there are

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2534-1
00:09:38.274 --> 00:09:39.130
certain things.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2591-0
00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:42.850
1st in linear algebra it becomes
difficult if I have to tell you

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2591-1
00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:46.511
a particular concept, but Octave
is one thing where you can do a

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2591-2
00:09:46.511 --> 00:09:49.834
structured programming, but I
don't have to spend too many

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2591-3
00:09:49.834 --> 00:09:53.213
number of lines declaring and
doing all this is I can start

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2591-4
00:09:53.213 --> 00:09:54.790
using the routines directly.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2607-0
00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.706
So I will prefer using octave
with the class for demonstration

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2607-1
00:09:58.706 --> 00:09:59.190
purposes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2613-0
00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.770
Whenever you want something, you
ask me.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2628-0
00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:03.910
I will demonstrate it for you so
that you can you can do that.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2645-0
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.690
You are also free to code in any
other language of your choice.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2679-0
00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:11.814
Uh, I also have a small tablet
where I can write something so

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2679-1
00:10:11.814 --> 00:10:15.683
in case something in the
PowerPoint is not clear then I

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2679-2
00:10:15.683 --> 00:10:17.480
will write something here.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2689-0
00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:22.220
I hope you are able to see this
MFDS session one.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2704-0
00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:25.560
Are you able to see this
clearly?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2717-0
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:27.380
Yeah. Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2709-0
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:27.360
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2712-0
00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:27.790
Visible.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2724-0
00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:28.100
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2725-0
00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:28.770
Yep, I can see.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2726-0
00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:28.780
Yeah, we can say.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2727-0
00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:30.180
So my contact number.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2744-0
00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:37.970
Is 9840140018.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2754-0
00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:41.630
Now this is only in the case of
emergency.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2772-0
00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:48.010
No forward, please whatsoever it
is how much?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2779-0
00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:50.130
How important is don't forward
any message?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2803-0
00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:54.757
I'm already, you know, my inbox
is full with all those things

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2803-1
00:10:54.757 --> 00:10:58.496
then, uh, I wanted you to
download something called

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2803-2
00:10:58.496 --> 00:10:59.000
Octave.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2820-0
00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:04.288
Ohh, CTA VE now, Octave is
available for sure for the

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2820-1
00:11:04.288 --> 00:11:05.950
Windows platform.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2835-0
00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:10.860
And it is also available for the
Unix platform.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2843-0
00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:15.600
Uh APARNA, you have used octave
in Mac.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2848-0
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:26.360
APARNA.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2853-0
00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:32.720
I don't know.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2861-0
00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:33.240
OK, fine.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2868-0
00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:33.920
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2874-0
00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:33.930
You can check for.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2885-0
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:37.100
So, Venkat, Sir, it's the octave
editor, right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2877-0
00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:34.630
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2893-0
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.990
No, it is an octave, which, uh,
is a interpreter, right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2907-0
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.800
It is similar to Matlab Upper.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2910-0
00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:41.750
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2911-0
00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:43.940
You used Octave for Mac.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2916-0
00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:46.200
Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2936-0
00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:47.510
No, Sir, I haven't used it.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2959-0
00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:49.860
You want to use OK, but you can
try it out man.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2946-0
00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:49.990
No, no, no, no, no.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2957-0
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.570
That one semester we are done,
Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2975-0
00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:52.670
Yes, Sir, we are done correct,
Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2973-0
00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:53.520
OK, market is available.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2976-0
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:54.540
I know for sure.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/2990-0
00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.600
So you can download it for Mac
also and then keep it ready.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3040-0
00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:00.894
This is only for some elementary
stuff we are going to do and for

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3040-1
00:12:00.894 --> 00:12:03.581
little bit of involved
programming you can use Python

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3040-2
00:12:03.581 --> 00:12:06.617
or something like that, but I
don't have the time and energy

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3040-3
00:12:06.617 --> 00:12:08.210
to use all of them in the class.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3048-0
00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:10.170
The types the classes are quite
tightly packed.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3060-0
00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.990
Uh, so this is about contact
number.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3077-0
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.568
This is about Octave and this is
about the course, the evaluation

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3077-1
00:12:19.568 --> 00:12:21.340
components and so on.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3115-0
00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:25.983
So please feel free to ask me
about truths of certain theorems

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3115-1
00:12:25.983 --> 00:12:30.129
which are not directly available
in the in the in the lecture

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3115-2
00:12:30.129 --> 00:12:32.470
slides and I will take it
forward.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3137-0
00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:37.101
I hope this is clearly I will
just keep this session open for

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3137-1
00:12:37.101 --> 00:12:40.400
another 2 minutes for you to ask
any questions.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3152-0
00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:43.750
OK, Kartik here.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3151-0
00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:43.580
Said one question.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3159-0
00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:45.340
One at a time, please.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3162-0
00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:46.890
So yeah, I I'll go first.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3198-0
00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:50.981
I mean I couldn't able to say
the handout as as a PDF format

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3198-1
00:12:50.981 --> 00:12:53.160
right when I open the course in
canvas.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3196-0
00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:54.200
Canvas print it is there.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3199-0
00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:55.040
You can come down.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3203-0
00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:57.330
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3214-0
00:12:58.950 --> 00:12:59.660
It is available.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3222-0
00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:02.260
It is not in the form of downer,
but I will.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3230-0
00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:03.140
I will take a look again.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3251-0
00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:05.940
It directly opens the page as a
PDF it it.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3245-0
00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:06.850
Yeah, I will put it up.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3288-0
00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:10.096
I'll put it up as a APARNA, can
you put the hand out in MS

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3288-1
00:13:10.096 --> 00:13:13.551
Teams, create a folder called
handout and put it so people can

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3288-2
00:13:13.551 --> 00:13:14.210
download it.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3290-0
00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:15.850
Yep, that helps.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3297-0
00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:16.980
You said I'll do that, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3303-0
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:16.340
Thank you.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3323-0
00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:19.624
I'll put a folder for LECTURES,
class, materials, everything

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3313-0
00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:19.960
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3323-1
00:13:19.624 --> 00:13:20.100
separately.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3318-0
00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:20.860
Can you?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3335-0
00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:24.847
Can you put it right away so
that you know 11 item is closed

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3335-1
00:13:24.847 --> 00:13:25.760
from our side?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3342-0
00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:28.420
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3348-0
00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:29.100
I'll do that, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3361-0
00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:29.780
Sure. OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3367-0
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:32.731
And also there some people are
asking for textbook to be just

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3367-1
00:13:32.731 --> 00:13:33.140
posted.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3372-0
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:33.980
We can't do that.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3397-0
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:37.310
We can just say that they can
download the PDF, yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3390-0
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:36.570
No, no textbook.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3395-0
00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:37.100
Why?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3400-0
00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:38.990
No, no textbook.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3411-0
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.870
You type the name and you get it
immediately for download.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3435-0
00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:42.700
Now PDF version.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3433-0
00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.390
Yes, yes, you should tell that
to them.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3440-0
00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:44.770
You, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3441-0
00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:45.070
Uh.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3446-0
00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:47.570
Why is that being a problem now?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3455-0
00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:54.300
Textbook is readily available.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3469-0
00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:58.470
You type MML hyphen book and you
should get it readily.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3488-0
00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:09.033
Yeah, Venkat, Sir, I have a
question regarding the

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3488-1
00:14:09.033 --> 00:14:10.770
assignment in assignment.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3532-0
00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:14.994
Like we can see that it is
online so like we can like

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3532-1
00:14:14.994 --> 00:14:19.598
online means it will it be a
layer or like a since all the

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3532-2
00:14:19.598 --> 00:14:24.203
assignments are online only we
will be completing and then

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3532-3
00:14:24.203 --> 00:14:25.920
submitting it through.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3530-0
00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:26.960
Yeah, online.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3553-0
00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:31.741
So the definition of online is
that it is individual based, so

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3553-1
00:14:31.741 --> 00:14:34.040
we will give a set of problems.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3586-0
00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:38.984
Mostly it is on the coding
stuff, so you do the coding, you

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3586-1
00:14:38.984 --> 00:14:42.941
do everything and then you
upload it as a PDF document in

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3586-2
00:14:42.941 --> 00:14:46.080
the canvas portal and submit
your assignment.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3594-0
00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:47.620
That is, what is the meaning of
online?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3599-0
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:49.810
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3619-0
00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:54.618
Bigger uh, if there are no more
doubts, can we start with

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3619-1
00:14:54.618 --> 00:14:55.380
lecture one?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3633-0
00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:57.230
I hope you're all gone through
lecture 0, right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3646-0
00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:01.530
Sir and Kritika here, Sara.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3644-0

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:04.660
And we will not accept
assignments from email.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3662-0
00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:05.080

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:06.820
That point also you make them
clear, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3691-0
00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:09.270
No, that no that is that that is
all given in the guidelines MA.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3702-0
00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:10.700
OK, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3698-0
00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:11.860
People have read through the
guidelines.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3717-0
00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:15.476

after the deadline.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3722-0
00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:17.420
You will not accept it.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3731-0
00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:19.260
That is a guideline people are
supposed to submit.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3779-0
00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:23.609
So just to just to reiterate the
fact that we have given the

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3742-0
00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:20.720
OK, Sir.

00:15:23.609 --> 00:15:27.635
dates app priority, so people
cannot say that you know, I came

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3779-2
00:15:27.635 --> 00:15:31.215
to know of the dates much later
etcetera, it is already

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3779-3
00:15:31.215 --> 00:15:32.110
available now.

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:36.083
APARNA is going to put the
handout in the MS Teams also has

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3810-1
00:15:36.083 --> 00:15:39.650
a dog as a doc, docx document so
people can download.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3825-0
00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:42.548
They can put in the calendar and
then they can see all those

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3825-1
00:15:42.548 --> 00:15:42.880
things.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3831-0

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:46.370
OK, fine.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3841-0
00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:46.840
Thank you.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3854-0
00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:53.310
I hope you all have seen the
slides for LECTURES 0 uh.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3858-0
00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:54.210
I'm I correct?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3872-0
00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:58.830
Can we safely assume that?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3869-0
00:15:58.110 --> 00:15:58.670
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3873-0

Yeah. Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3892-0
00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:02.990
OK, bye.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3891-0

Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3917-0
00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:06.490
In a quick walk through for 5-10
minutes, maybe helpful for all.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3895-0
00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:03.500
Well.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3911-0
00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:06.050
And that's.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3913-0
00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:07.820
What few mighta missed?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3932-0
00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:11.390
Actually, I'm one of them, Sir.
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3929-0
00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:10.590
You missed it.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3939-0
00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:12.000
Yeah, me too.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3936-0
00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:13.380
He can.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3950-0
00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:15.830
OK, so I will try to cover a
little bit of that.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3980-0
00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:20.271
Uh in the class, but I don't
know how successful I'm going to

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/3980-1
00:16:20.271 --> 00:16:24.560
be keeping in mind the kind of
slides we need to cover, OK?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4023-0
00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:28.722
Anyway, in case the in case you
have don't just raise your hand

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4023-1
00:16:28.722 --> 00:16:32.745
or you can even directly ask me
and then I will try to answer

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4023-2
00:16:32.745 --> 00:16:35.600
them in in whatever fashion it
is possible.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4031-0
00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:37.990
OK, So what is needed?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4033-0
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:38.390
Algebra.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4048-0
00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:41.810
This is we are trying to try to
manage their vectors.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4078-0
00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:46.526
If you know in machine learning
we have quite a bit of data Now

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4078-1
00:16:46.526 --> 00:16:50.442
this data, it is basically
represented as rows and columns

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4078-2
00:16:50.442 --> 00:16:51.570
in your language.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4093-0
00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:54.270
I hope most of you are from the
data science background, right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4104-0
00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.080
Or you're working in data
science projects.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4116-0
00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:57.800
No.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4124-0
00:16:58.250 --> 00:16:59.320
No, not necessarily.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4119-0
00:16:58.570 --> 00:16:58.940
No.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4123-0
00:16:58.690 --> 00:16:59.150
No, it's not.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4136-0
00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:02.200
OK, you are not working data
since projects.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4130-0
00:16:59.490 --> 00:16:59.960
No, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4147-0
00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:03.930
So should I give an example of a
data?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4146-0
00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:03.100
Not one.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4164-0
00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:12.229
OK, so for example we are trying
to do some analysis of

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4164-1
00:17:12.229 --> 00:17:14.760
something, so for example.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4178-0
00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:21.400
And you have heard about this
heart attack examples.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4181-0
00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:22.160
This is the healthcare.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4194-0
00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:27.500
In healthcare, we have a few
parameters.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4205-0
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:29.620
So for example, I will check to
be.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4211-0
00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:31.300
I mean, don't take it to heart.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4221-0
00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:32.740
I'm just giving you a rough
examples.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4223-0
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:33.240
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4237-0
00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:38.880
So somebody's BP hitch HBA 1C3.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4242-0
00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:40.240
You know this HBA 1C3.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4251-0
00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:42.400
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4256-0
00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:42.930
Except.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4257-0
00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:43.080
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4258-0
00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:43.460
Hemoglobin.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4284-0
00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:47.695
Ah, this is glycosylated
hemoglobin, which tells you how

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4284-1
00:17:47.695 --> 00:17:51.530
much of sugar is present in your
blood in the last three months

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4284-2
00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:52.010
average.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4290-0
00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:54.460
And this is a very important
pattern.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4298-0
00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:55.730
Then see them creating in.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4327-0
00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:59.908
Then you area you can have some
100 parameters and then finally

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4327-1
00:17:59.908 --> 00:18:03.710
you ask the fellow whether he
suffered a heart attack or no.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4338-0
00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:06.160
So this is going to be either a
zero or one.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4357-0
00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:13.590
That sense, if you want me to
put this is heart attack.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4375-0
00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:19.279
So you may take patient, maybe
this name is also there, so name

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4375-1
00:18:19.279 --> 00:18:20.120
is AAKASH.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4398-0
00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:28.658
AAKASH has a BP of 140 by 100
HBA 1C of 11.5 C them, created

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4398-1
00:18:28.658 --> 00:18:31.730
in urea etcetera, etcetera.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4419-0
00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:34.226
Measure and then you say that
this is one, which means he

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4419-1
00:18:34.226 --> 00:18:35.230
suffered a heart attack.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4434-0
00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:38.649
You will have age and other
things etcetera, etcetera,

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4434-1
00:18:38.649 --> 00:18:39.480
somewhere in this.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4439-0
00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:40.960
So you see a data here.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4446-0
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:44.650
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4450-0
00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:46.870
Now he does.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4452-0
00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:46.470
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4464-0
00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:47.120
No, that's.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4460-0
00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.460
He does a lot more parameters.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4469-0
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:50.150
You will find even 100
parameters.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4473-0
00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:52.210
Was he?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4517-0
00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:55.734
You know, detected with
something anomalies earlier last

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4517-1
00:18:55.734 --> 00:18:59.574
year that said, I mean you have
lots and lots of columns where

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4517-2
00:18:59.574 --> 00:19:03.049
this is being filled and
ultimate result is he is he has

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4517-3
00:19:03.049 --> 00:19:05.670
a he had a heart attack sometime
recently.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4521-0
00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.230
Now you will find somebody.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4529-0
00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:10.430
APARNA, give me your name.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4577-0
00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:20.604
Avinash, I've been noticing that
other character who has 150 by

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4577-1
00:19:20.604 --> 00:19:25.920
1:10 and his is 10.5 and all the
other parameters and he did not

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4577-2
00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:27.720
suffer a heart attack.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4582-0
00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:29.800
And similarly you'll have.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4593-0
00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:33.940
Let's say you collect this data
for about 10,000 fellows.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4604-0
00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:37.110
So you collect data for 10,000
fellows.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4613-0
00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:38.860
What you see is a matrix
structure.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4621-0
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:40.240
Are you able to see this matrix
structure?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4635-0
00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:45.450
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4649-0
00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:46.170
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4648-0
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:46.410
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4650-0
00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:50.810
So let's say this is a set of
100 parameters.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4662-0
00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:56.730
And then the 101 is a result.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4670-0
00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:01.050
This is column 101, right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4675-0
00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:04.050
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4695-0
00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:12.490
So this data is all about uh,
matrix, which is of size 10,801.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4703-0
00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:17.610
Agree.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4712-0
00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:19.250
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4722-0
00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:19.630
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4709-0
00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:19.760
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4725-0
00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:21.960
Now, what is the purpose of this
course?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4729-0
00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:20.780
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4731-0
00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:21.000
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4745-0
00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:25.600
What are we doing in this course
is you get all these results.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4759-0
00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:29.500
That's what when you go to the
market, you get all these data.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4785-0
00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:36.785
Now I am going to talk about a
person, let's say Winky and

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4785-1
00:20:36.785 --> 00:20:40.030
Venki has a BP of 130 by 90.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4814-0
00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:43.955
HB A1C of 9.2 you give all these
parameters and I want to know

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4814-1
00:20:43.955 --> 00:20:47.280
whether Venky is likely to
suffer a heart attack or not.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4823-0
00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:49.780
He's a Christian clear now.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4825-0
00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:51.940
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4827-0
00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:52.560
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4833-0
00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:54.640
Exactly clear.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4832-0
00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:54.050
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4836-0
00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:55.940
Listen.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4852-0
00:20:57.060 --> 00:21:02.450
So now if VENKATESH case you
find an identical row element.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4861-0
00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:04.990
You are lucky, but seldom.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4874-0
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.570
It is not true now because it
has 100 parameters.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4877-0
00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.020
Because 100 parameters.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4888-0
00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:10.610
I'm able to hear my own voice.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4896-0
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:10.610
Let me get my.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4892-0
00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:11.470
Or can I put some?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4900-0
00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.710
Can somebody put the system on
mute?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4922-0
00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:21.064
OK, so the likelihood of Winkies
case matching one of the 10,000

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4922-1
00:21:21.064 --> 00:21:22.420
is quite unlikely.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4946-0
00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:26.860
So we need to find out methods
by which you can predict it and

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4946-1
00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:28.810
predict it to a reasonable
accuracy.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4955-0
00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:31.890
Let's say 8090% accuracy that
you say.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4962-0
00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:34.050
Either it is a zero or a one.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4975-0
00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:40.140
OK, now this is the this is a
problem we have agree.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4977-0
00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:42.170
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/4992-0
00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:48.110
Now this this entity, this is
called a vector here for us.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5005-0
00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:51.830
So, given AAKASH, there is a
vector.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5019-0
00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:54.689
The vector has several
components, so I have noted down

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5019-1
00:21:54.689 --> 00:21:55.530
these components.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5035-0
00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:58.790
The first one is a BP second one
is HB A1C.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5044-0
00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:01.270
Then see them create and then
Yuria.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5050-0
00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:02.910
Maybe blood oxygen.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5058-0
00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.890
Nitrogen age.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5071-0
00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:09.099
All these things is 100
parameters you put in one long

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5071-1
00:22:09.099 --> 00:22:09.510
thing.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5089-0
00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:13.209
This is called one data point
and the result is 1, which means

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5089-1
00:22:13.209 --> 00:22:14.790
he suffered a heart attack.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5136-0
00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:19.041
Now the question is the easiest
mathematical entity to tackle

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5136-1
00:22:19.041 --> 00:22:22.658
all these things is vectors, so
you might have seen people

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5136-2
00:22:22.658 --> 00:22:26.581
representing something like, you
know, and the engineering they

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5136-3
00:22:26.581 --> 00:22:28.850
were killed you with these
problems.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5170-0
00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:34.535
Now there is a particle moving
from the position two 3 -, 4 to

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5170-1
00:22:34.535 --> 00:22:40.030
eight, 7, -, 7, and you have to
find the velocity and so on.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5183-0
00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:43.650
So this is very compact way of
representing the position.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5186-0
00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:45.310
The vector notation.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5230-0
00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:48.812
Now we are going to use the same
thing, not in determining the

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5230-1
00:22:48.812 --> 00:22:51.953
position, velocity et cetera,
but we are trying to manipulate

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5230-2
00:22:51.953 --> 00:22:55.094
it in such a way that we are
able to come out to this zero or

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5230-3
00:22:55.094 --> 00:22:55.500
one. OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5233-0
00:22:58.690 --> 00:22:58.790
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5247-0
00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:03.850
I hope the the idea of vectors
is now clear.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5259-0
00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:06.010
Why LECTURES enter?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5261-0
00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:05.860
Listen.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5264-0
00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:07.290
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5266-0
00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:07.980
OK, fine.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5287-0
00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:12.574
So this vector now if you take
one column vector, it will show

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5287-1
00:23:12.574 --> 00:23:15.050
the BP of all the 10,000
patients, right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5298-0
00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:19.500
Correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5320-0
00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:23.513
If you take this, if you take
this vector the first column, it

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5301-0
00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:20.160
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5320-1
00:23:23.513 --> 00:23:25.960
will show the BP of all the
10,000 fellows.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5339-0
00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:30.423
If you take the second column,
it'll show the HBA 1C of all the

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5339-1
00:23:30.423 --> 00:23:30.910
10,000.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5362-0
00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:34.659
So if you consider these
factors, it'll show you the

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5362-1
00:23:34.659 --> 00:23:35.880
variations among patients.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5379-0
00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:39.602
If you take it row wise it gives
for a particular patient all the

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5379-1
00:23:39.602 --> 00:23:40.830
100 parameters correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5386-0
00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:42.910
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5388-0
00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:43.520
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5393-0
00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:44.180
Character.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5392-0
00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:43.810
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5394-0
00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:45.060
Correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5406-0
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:47.880
So such quantities, that's what
I mentioned.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5401-0
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:45.710
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5415-0
00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:49.260
So this is something called.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5437-0
00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:53.798
I mean one record like you take
a sheet of paper and you can't

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5437-1
00:23:53.798 --> 00:23:55.380
go and talk to AAKASH.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5449-0
00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:58.680
Get all this data or to a lab
assistant, get all the data.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5461-0
00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:01.930
This is 1 record and this is
called a row vector OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5474-0
00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:06.150
OK, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5477-0
00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:06.530
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5478-0
00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:07.950
Now look at the column vector.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5480-0
00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:06.880
Correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5485-0
00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:09.050
Row Vector is one way.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5492-0
00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:10.330
The number of rows is 1.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5522-0
00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:14.033
If you take the column vector,
that means you go to a hospital

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5522-1
00:24:14.033 --> 00:24:16.926
or you know you set of people
and then you take the BP

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5522-2
00:24:16.926 --> 00:24:17.610
measurements.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5540-0
00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:21.850
You will get the BP measurements
of all the 10,000 patients.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5546-0
00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.450
Now this is called a column
vector.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5551-0
00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:25.910
Agree.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5584-0
00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:29.515
So you have row vectors, you
have row vector column vectors,

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5561-0
00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:27.240
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5563-0
00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:27.330
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5575-0
00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:28.890
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5584-1
00:24:29.515 --> 00:24:31.970
and then if you put all of them
together, you get a matrix.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5610-0
00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:35.553
Now from the given matrix we
have tried to find Ways and

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5610-1
00:24:35.553 --> 00:24:38.750
Means by which you know I am
able to predict something.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5628-0
00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:43.990
Now 130 by 929 point 2A dot dot
dot I have 100 parameters.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5645-0
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.403
Then tell me whether I am at the
risk of having a heart attack or

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5645-1
00:24:47.403 --> 00:24:47.610
not.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5676-0
00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:51.884
Now we will try to predict it as
a part of this course and I will

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5676-1
00:24:51.884 --> 00:24:55.420
tell you mathematically what is
there and how complex this is.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5678-0
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:56.400
And so on.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5686-0
00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:58.420
Is the.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5702-0
00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:01.350
Is it motivating enough for you
to get into subject?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5709-0
00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:02.820
Absolutely, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5715-0
00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:03.610
Yeah, get.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5714-0
00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:03.330
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5711-0
00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:04.170
OK, fine.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5720-0
00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:05.820
And this is 1 healthcare.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5745-0
00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:09.565
There are people who say I want
to use machine learning in

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5745-1
00:25:09.565 --> 00:25:13.120
finding out whether there is a
crack inside a metal body.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5764-0
00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:17.496
There are people who do this
physical inspection and there

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5764-1
00:25:17.496 --> 00:25:18.700
are people who do.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5789-0
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:22.685
I want to predict something and
maybe insurance, whether I'm

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5789-1
00:25:22.685 --> 00:25:26.140
going to get this insurance
money or not, et cetera.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5800-0
00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:29.210
So it is used in a wide variety
of areas.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5816-0
00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:32.530
We will take one or two and we
will give some assignments.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5839-0
00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:36.326
Based on this, in the in the
assignments also so that you are

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5839-1
00:25:36.326 --> 00:25:39.990
simply, you know, equipped to
deal with those things stick.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5843-0
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:40.710
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5869-0
00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:44.774
So we are going to work with
vectors and and and the space is

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5869-1
00:25:44.774 --> 00:25:48.640
basically R and which means say
these are all real numbers.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5922-0
00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:53.669
Traditionally, I mean, whatever
the analysis we do, we can also

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5922-1
00:25:53.669 --> 00:25:56.968
carry it on to complex numbers,
but very seldom in real life we

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5922-2
00:25:56.968 --> 00:26:00.061
come to come across data which
are complex in nature, so we

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5922-3
00:26:00.061 --> 00:26:02.020
will always restrict to real
numbers.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5939-0
00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:06.660
So these vectors will all be in
no in in RN.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5973-0
00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:11.289
Now what is most important is
the formation of linear

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5973-1
00:26:11.289 --> 00:26:15.686
equations from a given modeling
problem and trying to find out

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5973-2
00:26:15.686 --> 00:26:17.850
the solutions of these systems.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/5987-0
00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:22.290
Now with this one or two, I
think we have already solved.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6004-0
00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:25.838
So you are quite familiar with
the solving things like you know

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6004-1
00:26:25.838 --> 00:26:27.110
a single variable case.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6012-0
00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:30.180
Now I will write a few examples.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6046-0
00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:34.560
So you are asked to solve two X
+ 3 equal to 7 and then you

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6046-1
00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:39.076
immediately wrote this as two X
equal to four and which where

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6046-2
00:26:39.076 --> 00:26:40.970
you X equal to 2. Correct?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6091-0
00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:46.794
So we we are quite comfortable
solving single, but when it came

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6091-1
00:26:46.794 --> 00:26:52.163
to two X + 3, the three Y equal
to 7 and four X + 5 Y equal to

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6091-2
00:26:52.163 --> 00:26:56.340
11, I think we also managed to
solve this right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6105-0
00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:58.560
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6102-0
00:26:58.940 --> 00:26:59.460
Get set.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6137-0
00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:03.894
I think we managed to solve this
in lower classes, but the point

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6115-0
00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:00.590
More or less, yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6125-0
00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:01.730
Yes, yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6129-0
00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:02.900
This.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6131-0
00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:03.460
You know.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6137-1
00:27:03.894 --> 00:27:05.950
is you know that game is over.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6152-0
00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:11.610
Now we have so in one variable
we had one equation 1 variable.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6175-0
00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:15.824
These were two equations in two
variables, et cetera, and the

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6175-1
00:27:15.824 --> 00:27:19.090
people who did the work from the
other backgrounds.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6187-0
00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:21.976
They also wrote christoff's
voltage law, current law, et

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6187-1
00:27:21.976 --> 00:27:22.330
cetera.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6240-0
00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:30.751
So you aren't solved something
like 2X plus three y + 4 Z equal

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6240-1
00:27:30.751 --> 00:27:38.500
to 11/5 X minus four y + 11 Z
equal to 15 and three X -, 7 Y

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6240-2
00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:41.550
minus 8, ZE equal to 12.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6242-0
00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:42.500
Something like that.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6258-0
00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:45.750
So this also you were trying to
solve this and you could do it.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6267-0
00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:48.130
This is 3 equations and three
unknowns.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6298-0
00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:52.290
Now, these were our comfort
domains, but I don't think

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6298-1
00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:55.847
anybody ventured into four, four
comma 4-5, comma, 5-6, comma 6,

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6298-2
00:27:55.847 --> 00:27:56.340
etcetera.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6305-0
00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:59.890
Now that comfort zone is lost
now.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6314-0
00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:03.440
The reason is we have M
equations.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6319-0
00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:05.800
Umm.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6321-0
00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:07.710
Equations in N unknowns.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6370-0
00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:14.385
So these three comma three is
replaced by MN and this M is not

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6370-1
00:28:14.385 --> 00:28:18.056
necessarily equal to north,
which means either you can have

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6370-2
00:28:18.056 --> 00:28:21.850
more number of equations and
less number of variables or more

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6370-3
00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:24.910
number of variables and less
number of equations.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6391-0
00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:28.101
This is also always possible if
you are very lucky, you'll get

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6391-1
00:28:28.101 --> 00:28:29.010
me equal to north.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6410-0
00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:34.494
You can see in the above, my mom
was almost like 10,000 and then

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6410-1
00:28:34.494 --> 00:28:36.130
was like 101, right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6414-0
00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:39.020
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6418-0
00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:40.240
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6419-0
00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:41.070
So.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6450-0
00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:46.509
So the point is, uh, a this
young equations in N unknowns is

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6450-1
00:28:46.509 --> 00:28:51.376
the challenge which we have in
in in machine learning in

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6450-2
00:28:51.376 --> 00:28:52.060
general.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6494-0
00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:56.115
Now at least now it is linear
equations, but later on we will

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6494-1
00:28:56.115 --> 00:28:59.450
see that we will move out of
this also and we'll get into

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6494-2
00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:02.900
constraints which are either
linear or nonlinear in nature.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6523-0
00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:06.418
That makes the game quite
complex, so I'll start with a

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6523-1
00:29:06.418 --> 00:29:10.130
very simple motivating example
of telling you saying that where

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6523-2
00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:11.870
we encounter all these things.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6550-0
00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:16.265
No, this is a very simple toy
problem, but this is just to

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6550-1
00:29:16.265 --> 00:29:19.720
tell you this M&amp;N can create
havoc amongst us now.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6569-0
00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:24.726
This is about a company which
produces products like N1N2 up

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6569-1
00:29:24.726 --> 00:29:25.300
to CNN.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6596-0
00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:31.177
If I when I make a statement NN
the first N is a capital N and

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6596-1
00:29:31.177 --> 00:29:33.740
the small N is a small NI mean
N.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6613-0
00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:39.060
There are resources R1R2 up to R
which are required now.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6621-0
00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:41.700
This is also uh.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6628-0
00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:44.320
If people are anybody from
economics background in this

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6628-1
00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:44.600
group.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6630-0
00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:48.830
Nobody.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6632-0
00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:49.130
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6640-0
00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:54.380
Nobody's from economics
background.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6649-0
00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:01.220
Now you're all lost suddenly.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6661-0
00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:03.610
No.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6677-0
00:30:03.090 --> 00:30:04.960
No, I believe no. No.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6666-0
00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:04.010
And no Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6669-0
00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:04.470
Nobody.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6684-0
00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:05.190
Nobody so far.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6682-0
00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:05.950
Nobody's OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6696-0
00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:06.560
Yeah, I don't know.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6693-0
00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:07.870
Fine, you can you, you you can.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6695-0
00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:06.460
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6699-0
00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:06.950
Closer.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6701-0
00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.200
You can check something called.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6705-0
00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:12.390
Leontief model.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6733-0
00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:18.945
Now Leontis Noble Prize winner,
and this is a part a part of

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6733-1
00:30:18.945 --> 00:30:22.760
this problem is actually a A
presented by Leontief.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6764-0
00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:27.470
Now this is AN1N2 up to and then
add the products which are

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6764-1
00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:32.280
produced and it need not be that
they're exclusively for others.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6797-0
00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:35.384
Some of it can be consumed with
self also, but anyway I will

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6797-1
00:30:35.384 --> 00:30:37.775
come to it when probably I'll
give a problem in the

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6797-2
00:30:37.775 --> 00:30:39.660
examination for you to ponder
one thing.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6821-0
00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:45.086
So this company produces N1N2 up
to N for which resources R1R2

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6821-1
00:30:45.086 --> 00:30:46.460
and R are required.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6845-0
00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:53.610
Now to produce one unit of NIAIJ
units of resource, RJ are needed

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6845-1
00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:53.900
uh.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6867-0
00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:58.746
If this is very abstract, I will
tell you something like you want

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6867-1
00:30:58.746 --> 00:31:00.620
to produce one unit of N1.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6887-0
00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:06.429
So you put I equal to 1 you
require a one J you units of

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6887-1
00:31:06.429 --> 00:31:07.600
resource RJ.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6924-0
00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:16.550
So A11 of resource R1A12 of
resource R2A12 of resource, A

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6924-1
00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:22.540
1/3 of resource R3 and so on,
and A1M of RM.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6928-0
00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:24.010
These are required, agree.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6943-0
00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:27.410
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6940-0
00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:28.200
Yes and yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6938-0
00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:28.310
It yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6961-0
00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:28.470
Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6949-0
00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:28.850
And yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6959-0
00:31:28.650 --> 00:31:28.950
Yep.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6957-0
00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:29.380
What about?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6966-0
00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:30.240
Yes, Sir, I need to.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6972-0
00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:30.970
Can you please speak this one
again?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6969-0
00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:30.420
It.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6974-0
00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:32.960
Yeah, sure, sure, sure.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6994-0
00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:39.038
So to produce one unit of yen
one uh, you require a IJ units

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/6994-1
00:31:39.038 --> 00:31:40.690
of resources, RJ.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7010-0
00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:45.180
So what it means is if you want
to produce one unit of N1.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7030-0
00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:49.740
Ohh so you put I.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7026-0
00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:50.640
So so here I have been here.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7036-0
00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:51.680
I have a question, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7045-0
00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:53.750
When we when will you say AIJ?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7077-0
00:31:53.760 --> 00:32:00.677
That means one component of N
and one component of R which is

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7077-1
00:32:00.677 --> 00:32:01.570
ING and.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7065-0
00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:01.880
That is index.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7072-0
00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:06.080
So the index is basically a.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7076-0
00:32:08.150 --> 00:32:08.640
I will say.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7083-0
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:12.830
If it is too abstract.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7119-0
00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:24.142
So this is like the you you
know, this is to say if I want

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7106-0
00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:20.880
So you can come back with you to
understand.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7119-1
00:32:24.142 --> 00:32:25.680
to produce uh.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7121-0
00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:29.830
Uh.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7137-0
00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:40.070
N 2 + 3 H two gives 2NH3 you
remember this.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7140-0
00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:41.250
This is here was equation.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7142-0
00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:46.360
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7150-0
00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:51.940
Yes, Sir. Order.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7173-0
00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:59.115
OK, so which is roughly saying
half a mole of N 2 + 3 by two of

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7173-1
00:32:59.115 --> 00:33:03.830
H2 gives in history one wall of
this, right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7185-0
00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:11.520
Now this is your this is your
R1.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7216-0
00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:16.303
This is your R2 to produce one
mole of this computer NH3, you

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7216-1
00:33:16.303 --> 00:33:20.614
require half a mole of N2 and
three by two moles of R2,

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7216-2
00:33:20.614 --> 00:33:21.230
correct?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7219-0
00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:25.120
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7233-0
00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:28.360
Now what is confusing here?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7225-0
00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:27.720
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7244-0
00:33:27.730 --> 00:33:28.870
What is completely get this?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7247-0
00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:30.716
This symbol this say it's a
reversible reaction if I

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7247-1
00:33:30.716 --> 00:33:31.380
remember right.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7265-0
00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:36.106
They should ask the APARNA
because she is a chemistry

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7265-1
00:33:36.106 --> 00:33:36.420
Topper.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7271-0
00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:38.250
This is Herbert.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7302-0
00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:42.580
Process it happens in the
process of a catalyst and a very

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7302-1
00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:47.267
high temperature, probably 383
Kelvin, and iron is the catalyst

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7302-2
00:33:47.267 --> 00:33:48.000
Fe ticket.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7316-0
00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:51.980
So now if you want to produce
this is your.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7325-0
00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:54.820
This is your N1 if you.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7353-0
00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:58.896
If you want to produce one unit
of north one, you require half a

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7353-1
00:33:58.896 --> 00:34:01.360
unit of R1 and three by two
units of R2.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7355-0
00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:02.120
Agree.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7393-0
00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:07.128
Now in the generic sense, since
I don't want to deal with half

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7393-1
00:34:07.128 --> 00:34:11.489
three by two, etcetera, I will
say this is this is a 11 and

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7393-2
00:34:11.489 --> 00:34:12.870
this is a 12 agree.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7404-0
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:15.380
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7399-0
00:34:15.450 --> 00:34:15.880
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7415-0
00:34:15.890 --> 00:34:16.690
Yes, Sir. Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7412-0
00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:16.540
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7425-0
00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:20.390
OK, so you do this for all the
products.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7414-0
00:34:16.410 --> 00:34:16.590
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7432-0
00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:22.850
You need to find an optimal
plan.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7434-0
00:34:22.910 --> 00:34:23.230
Why?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7446-0
00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:25.550
Why this optimal plan is
required?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7453-0
00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:29.800
The optimal plan is required
because you need to.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7463-0
00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:33.660
You need to exhaust everything.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7503-0
00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:40.138
There are BJ units of RJ so R1
you have B1 units of R1, some

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7503-1
00:34:40.138 --> 00:34:45.480
bundles of R1B2 units of R2B3
units of R3 and so on.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7511-0
00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:47.260
You have BM units of RM.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7529-0
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:50.510
These are all there in their gun
and you want to use all of them.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7568-0
00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:56.257
So you will need to find out
what is the optimal production

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7568-1
00:34:56.257 --> 00:35:01.203
plan for the number of units N1
which is going to be produced

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7568-2
00:35:01.203 --> 00:35:02.560
N2N 3N4 up to NN.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7573-0
00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:04.540
Now this is what it is.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7593-0
00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:07.981
So you have to draw this little
diagram and then you will be

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7593-1
00:35:07.981 --> 00:35:09.090
able to find it out.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7608-0
00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:12.171
So should I draw the diagram and
tell you how this proceeds in

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7608-1
00:35:12.171 --> 00:35:12.580
one step?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7624-0
00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:15.940
Yes, yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7619-0
00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:15.670
Yes, please.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7617-0
00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:16.200
Yes, yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7632-0
00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:15.940
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7622-0
00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:16.420
Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7637-0
00:35:16.450 --> 00:35:17.740
OK, OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7634-0
00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:16.850
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7630-0
00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:17.450
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7635-0
00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:18.340
So OK, fine.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7665-0
00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:28.221
So this is so you have products
N1N2 up to NNN agree now to

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7665-1
00:35:28.221 --> 00:35:34.390
produce one unit of 1 unit of
yen one.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7672-0
00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:36.680
How much of R1 is required?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7681-0
00:35:40.210 --> 00:35:40.800
How far one?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7685-0
00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:41.590
Not yeah, yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7715-0
00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:44.240
So this is yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7707-0
00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:43.970
BIDIT units.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7701-0
00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:43.810
Yeah, I did.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7721-0
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:44.610
Even one.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7722-0
00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:44.650
So fine, honey.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7709-0
00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:44.520
This is your.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7724-0
00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:46.450
R1, this is your R2.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7727-0
00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:45.490
That's on what?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7746-0
00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:52.200
This is your R so you you need a
11 units of R1 correct?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7747-0
00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:53.500
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7751-0
00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:53.910
Yes, yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7759-0
00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:56.810
And year 1/2 units of R2.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7758-0
00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:55.020
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7764-0
00:35:58.390 --> 00:35:58.810
Umm.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7770-0
00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:01.750
And Year 1 units of RM.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7772-0
00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:03.760
Umm.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7773-0
00:36:03.610 --> 00:36:03.690
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7800-0
00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:08.912
The ultimate idea is not to
produce one unit of North one,

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7800-1
00:36:08.912 --> 00:36:11.880
but we want to produce X1 units
of N 1, correct?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7804-0
00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:13.690
Mm-hmm.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7808-0
00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:16.530
So to produce X1 units.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7826-0
00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:23.150
Of N1, how much of R1 is
required A11X1.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7828-0
00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:24.950
Umm.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7833-0
00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:27.460
Yeah, 12X1.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7855-0
00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:32.760
And all the way up to A1A MX X1.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7851-0
00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:31.180
Got it. Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7856-0
00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:33.920
Right.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7859-0
00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:36.190
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7861-0
00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:36.650
Correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7865-0
00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:37.940
Yep.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7866-0
00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:38.990
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7870-0
00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:39.240
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7915-0
00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:44.473
Yeah, yeah, if you it is
something like if you want to

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7915-1
00:36:44.473 --> 00:36:49.828
produce one unit of yen one, you
use a 11 units of R1A12 units of

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7915-2
00:36:49.828 --> 00:36:53.480
R2 and A1M units of R and put
them together.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7918-0
00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:53.760
Mix.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7932-0
00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:56.100
Do the chemical processing and
get one unit of north one.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7948-0
00:36:56.510 --> 00:37:00.080
But the ideal thing is I want to
produce X1 units of North 1X1.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7985-0
00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:03.888
I don't know what X1 is, but I
want to find out the optimal

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7985-1
00:37:03.888 --> 00:37:07.623
production level so to produce
X1 units of N1 I will use a

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/7985-2
00:37:07.623 --> 00:37:08.510
11X1, correct?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8049-0
00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:17.432
So when you say A11 then A-12
dot dot dot A1M so we're

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8002-0
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:13.590
It.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8016-0
00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:17.220
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8049-1
00:37:17.432 --> 00:37:23.878
producing 1 unit of N1 and the
above series say N1N2 dot dot

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8049-2
00:37:23.878 --> 00:37:25.780
dot NN so why not?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8054-0
00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:27.990
No, these are the product, Sir,
these are the products, Bubba.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8066-0
00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:28.940
Right. So.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8072-0
00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:31.170
Yet in ¥1, talk to you and then
at the end products.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8085-0
00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:33.960
OK, so the same.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8086-0
00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:34.410
So there is excellent of N 1.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8090-0
00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:36.070
There is no, no.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8104-0
00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:40.490
We want to find out the optimum
production of N1N2 up to NN.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8115-0
00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:42.150
So how do you find the outer
protection?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8135-0
00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:45.778
I will say let's produce the X1
units of N1X2 units of N2,

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8135-1
00:37:45.778 --> 00:37:46.330
etcetera.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8154-0
00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:50.078
Finally, I need to come out with
what my X1X2 up to X and should

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8154-1
00:37:50.078 --> 00:37:50.560
be right.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8180-0
00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:55.110
Another variable to calculate
the amount.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8168-0
00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:54.080
Right, yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8184-0
00:37:53.590 --> 00:37:55.990
Another variable that variable.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8185-0
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.390
That variable is there. Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8204-0
00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:01.416
So the same company can be
producing 10 different items,

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8192-0
00:37:57.530 --> 00:37:57.740
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8204-1
00:38:01.416 --> 00:38:01.980
correct?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8211-0
00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:04.470
So that means N1 and N2.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8235-0
00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:08.688
These two, these all are
different series inside N1N2

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8232-0
00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:09.060
Double.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8235-1
00:38:08.688 --> 00:38:09.000
dot.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8242-0
00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:12.400
OK, now I think there seems to
be something.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8259-0
00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:14.030
Yeah, I will take an example
here.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8255-0
00:38:13.570 --> 00:38:14.880
You can example book.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8260-0
00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:15.540
Yeah, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8280-0
00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:19.348
Can you explain with the with an
example of an automotive

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8280-1
00:38:19.348 --> 00:38:20.920
automotive car industry?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8291-0
00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:21.240
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8298-0
00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:21.590
Something like that.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8285-0
00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:21.540
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8315-0
00:38:21.290 --> 00:38:26.480
OK, Ohh OK, let me let me take
JK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8308-0
00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:24.110
Something with the like live
example kind of.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8317-0
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:28.900
They produce tires, right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8321-0
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:30.990
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8335-0
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:39.180
Now, now N1 can be 135 uh, 5530.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8339-0
00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:40.300
Do you know this?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8346-0
00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:41.660
This is a 13 each tire.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8363-0
00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:45.010
Yeah, adding radial tire.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8375-0
00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:51.270
Then to ah Yen two can be
1554015.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8385-0
00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:54.790
Now they can be producing all
cuts.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8400-0
00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:58.050
I mean, they will produce it for
Mardu Suzuki celerio.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8409-0
00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:00.450
They'll be producing it for
Mercedes Benz.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8431-0
00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:04.031
I'm not very sure about JK, But
I mean, you know, they produce

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8431-1
00:39:04.031 --> 00:39:05.450
it for at least 20 vehicles.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8443-0
00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:07.860
So you will have something like
N 11020, right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8455-0
00:39:09.930 --> 00:39:11.140
Yes, yes, correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8453-0
00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:10.520
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8471-0
00:39:11.090 --> 00:39:14.140
Now, what are the raw materials
required for this industry?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8470-0
00:39:11.490 --> 00:39:12.890
Now, what are the wrong way?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8481-0
00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:12.580
Listen.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8479-0
00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:17.940
So one hour one is for example
rubber.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8485-0
00:39:22.890 --> 00:39:23.170
Right.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8487-0
00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:24.640
Right.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8498-0
00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:25.280
Hmm. Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8512-0
00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:28.450
After R2 is some kind of a
steel.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8500-0
00:39:25.610 --> 00:39:25.730
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8505-0
00:39:25.770 --> 00:39:26.070
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8520-0
00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:29.750
Still, yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8533-0
00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:34.910
Now R3R3 can be something.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8525-0
00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:31.150
Correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8538-0
00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:36.750
R4 can be something.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8547-0
00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:40.180
Maybe you have a ten ingredients
or 10, correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8553-0
00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:42.710
Correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8561-0
00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:44.110
Got it.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8593-0
00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:48.841
So the point is now people say
if you want to produce one tier

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8563-0
00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:44.410
Correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8593-1
00:39:48.841 --> 00:39:53.575
of north one, if you want to
produce one tier of north one,

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8593-2
00:39:53.575 --> 00:39:54.680
you use a one.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8654-0
00:39:54.740 --> 00:40:00.290
You're amount of R1A12 amount of
R2A13 amount of R3A1 four amount

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8654-1
00:40:00.290 --> 00:40:05.504
of R4 up to a 110 amount of R10,
and you put all of them in a

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8654-2
00:40:05.504 --> 00:40:09.120
dubba then you will get one unit
of N1 OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8662-0
00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:10.710
Mm-hmm.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8664-0
00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:11.310
Correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8666-0
00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:11.450
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8682-0
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:12.420
Correct, yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8678-0
00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:12.330
Correct, Sir. Right.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8671-0
00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:11.930
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8681-0
00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:12.560
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8684-0
00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:14.610
That's what I'm saying now.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8705-0
00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:18.968
So if you compare the same thing
here N1 and this is 1 tire, this

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8705-1
00:40:18.968 --> 00:40:20.330
is another tire size.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8725-0
00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:23.030
This is another tire size, so
there are north tire sizes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8746-0
00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:26.215
The tier companies manufacturing
and these are R1 raw material,

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8746-1
00:40:26.215 --> 00:40:28.150
one raw material 2 up to raw
material.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8762-0
00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:30.290
Now, what do you do in simple
process?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8769-0
00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:33.250
You put R1R2 in some measured
quantities.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8791-0
00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:36.490
Put it inside and then you you
shake it well, you get one

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8791-1
00:40:36.490 --> 00:40:37.270
product of N1.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8799-0
00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:40.580
But my question is I don't know.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8843-0
00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:44.699
I have a big godown in which
there are so many materials R1

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8843-1
00:40:44.699 --> 00:40:48.877
up to RM and I just want to
finish all the raw materials and

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8843-2
00:40:48.877 --> 00:40:52.850
make it empty and I want to
produce it and produce tires.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8866-0
00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:55.388
Now the question is how much of
the one how much of enter and

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8866-1
00:40:55.388 --> 00:40:56.810
how much of Anand should I
produce?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8892-0
00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:00.745
So I assume that X1 units of
North One's produced for one

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8892-1
00:41:00.745 --> 00:41:01.870
unit of North one.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8950-0
00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:06.738
I am spending A11 units of R1A12
units of R2 and A1M units of R

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8950-1
00:41:06.738 --> 00:41:11.140
so if you want to produce X1
units of North, one will not

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8950-2
00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:14.860
multiply each of the raw middle
by by my ex one.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8958-0
00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:16.680
Correct, correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8948-0
00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:16.300
Correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8973-0
00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:17.060
Yes, correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8963-0
00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:16.910
Yes, yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8984-0
00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:19.930
So yeah, 11X1 will be used from
R1A12X1.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8967-0
00:41:16.690 --> 00:41:17.250
Yes, correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8977-0
00:41:17.490 --> 00:41:17.820
No.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/8991-0
00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:19.840
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9005-0
00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:23.820
Will be used from R2 up to A1 MX
one will be used from R correct?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9013-0
00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:25.140
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9022-0
00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:25.840
Yes, Sir. Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9023-0
00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:25.570
Correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9033-0
00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:27.420
Umm simple multiplication.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9017-0
00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:26.460
OK now.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9020-0
00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:27.020
Let's.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9048-0
00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:29.800
Produce X2 units. What?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9039-0
00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:29.530
When you say A11 so.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9075-0
00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:34.020
When you say 11A11, any specific
reason for using this double

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9075-1
00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:34.930
digit number?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9071-0
00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:35.580
Because I need to I need I need.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9085-0
00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:38.300
I need this to be a subscripted
variable.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9098-0
00:41:38.310 --> 00:41:41.578
Two indices are required because
it is used for the next product

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9098-1
00:41:41.578 --> 00:41:41.830
also.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9116-0
00:41:42.570 --> 00:41:44.430
But those vectors?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9136-0
00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:47.380
So if if I want then I can I can
name it as A1 and A2 also.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9131-0
00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:48.590
No, you cannot.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9137-0
00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:49.070
No, you cannot.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9153-0
00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:49.250
That's correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9150-0
00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:49.690
That's it, right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9187-0
00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:53.550
A11 denotes a row and column
actually.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9168-0
00:41:50.830 --> 00:41:52.110
This is your N1.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9189-0
00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:53.790
VRN one and two.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9179-0
00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:53.960
Yeah, this is.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9185-0
00:41:53.970 --> 00:41:54.870
This is the N1.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9195-0
00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:54.880
OK, got it.

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:55.800
This is YN 2.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9203-0
00:41:55.870 --> 00:41:59.620
This is YN 3 and the last one is
N.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9213-0
00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:02.770
And this is R1.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9225-0
00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:06.310
This is R2 up to RM now this
one.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9231-0
00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:08.130
One will refer to this one one.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9246-0
00:42:09.490 --> 00:42:11.130
OK, OK, got it.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9253-0
00:42:10.770 --> 00:42:14.460
Is 1-2 with refer to this one
and this two and so on.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9279-0
00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:18.110
Now if I want to produce X2
units of, yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9269-0
00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:15.560
For the.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9273-0
00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:17.650
Uh, said one comment.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9290-0
00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:22.480
One comment, can we consider
this R as a row and a as a

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9290-1
00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:23.070
column?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9312-0
00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:28.250
So this could be easy to imagine
or put in a better in memory.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9329-0
00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:29.040
Do you think that way?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9320-0
00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:29.470
He did it.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9325-0
00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:30.210
No, there are.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9338-0
00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:31.862
I'm coming to the
implementation, just give Me 2

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9338-1
00:42:31.862 --> 00:42:32.130
minutes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9348-0
00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:33.780
Ohh sure snoring.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9375-0
00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:40.436
OK, now if I want to produce X2
units of N21 unit of yen two

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9375-1
00:42:40.436 --> 00:42:43.750
will require a 21 units of R1.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9409-0
00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:49.889
So EX2 units will require a 21X1
and now it will be a 22X2 and so

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9409-1
00:42:49.889 --> 00:42:52.430
on up to A2, Ms Excel agree.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9412-0
00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:53.760
Yes, Sir.

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:57.700
Now you come to the now you you
know the game, right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9449-0
00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:58.480
Yeah, increasers, yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9453-0
00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:00.330
So you come to the last row, so
this is a.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9461-0
00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:02.180
What is it that I should write?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/9474-0
00:43:03.070 --> 00:43:06.020
2N2NN XN.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10128-1
00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:52.590
line.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10146-0
00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:58.845
Lastly, it says whatever be the
total amount of resource one I

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10146-1
00:45:58.845 --> 00:45:59.770
am having.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10161-0
00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:03.200
If I add up all these things, I
should get equal to B1.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10166-0
00:46:04.330 --> 00:46:05.650
Yes, yes, yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10187-0
00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:09.736
And whatever resource I have
here, I should add up to this is

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10187-1
00:46:09.736 --> 00:46:11.550
to add up to B2 and so on,
right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10197-0
00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:14.030
Right, right.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10212-0
00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:18.491
OK, so I have the set of
equations now that's what the

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10212-1
00:46:18.491 --> 00:46:19.870
the equations here.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10223-0
00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:24.430
The most important thing for you
to note down is this.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10249-0
00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:28.899
Not that you will get a system
like this, so the system is

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10249-1
00:46:28.899 --> 00:46:32.150
something like you have let me
write down.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10252-0
00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:33.340
So you have.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10269-0
00:46:36.810 --> 00:46:42.360
We have a vendor N is not equal
to M we have.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10275-0
00:46:42.450 --> 00:46:44.730
I will for the timing, I'll call
unbalanced.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10287-0
00:46:47.650 --> 00:46:49.930
Number of equations and unknowns
you agree with me.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10291-0
00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:51.680
Yes, correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10328-0
00:46:52.890 --> 00:46:56.481
So I don't know about N and I
don't know about M, probably the

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10328-1
00:46:56.481 --> 00:46:59.901
number of raw materials can be
much more than the number of

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10328-2
00:46:59.901 --> 00:47:03.150
products you produce, or it can
be the other way around.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10371-0
00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:09.951
So the idea is, suppose you are
given a system A11X1 plus A12X2

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10371-1
00:47:09.951 --> 00:47:14.300
plus all the way up to A1N XN
equal to B1.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10429-0
00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:23.824
Now A to 1X1 plus A22X2 plus all
the way up to A2NX NE equal to

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10429-1
00:47:23.824 --> 00:47:32.309
B2 all the way up to AM 1X1 plus
AM 2X2 plus all the way 2:00 AM

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10429-2
00:47:32.309 --> 00:47:34.790
and XN equal to BM.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10446-0
00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:39.880
Now the question is when the M
is not equal to N, how do we

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10446-1
00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:40.610
solve it?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10456-0
00:47:43.550 --> 00:47:47.450
We saw and viewport antley
nature of solutions.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10477-0
00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:55.055
Now you say something about the
nature of solutions just by

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10477-1
00:47:55.055 --> 00:47:55.930
having a look at it.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10489-0
00:47:56.670 --> 00:48:01.120
Now the question is no, we need
little more analysis now.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10513-0
00:48:01.130 --> 00:48:05.983
The analysis part will become
little lengthy, but one way of

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10513-1
00:48:05.983 --> 00:48:10.360
looking at it is by the matrix
representation of this.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10557-0
00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:15.674
What is the matrix
representation you call a matrix

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10557-1
00:48:15.674 --> 00:48:21.904
A to be a 11A12 up to A1NA21A22
up to a 2N and all the way at

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10557-2
00:48:21.904 --> 00:48:23.110
2:00 AM one.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10599-0
00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:29.683
Hey, I'm too up to AM and and
you call an X to be equal to

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10599-1
00:48:29.683 --> 00:48:36.328
X1X2 all the way up to XN and
you call A/B to be be 1B2 up to

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10599-2
00:48:36.328 --> 00:48:36.650
BF.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10605-0
00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:39.000
Then the entire system.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10617-0
00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:45.497
This system can be represented
quite easily as a * X equal to

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10617-1
00:48:45.497 --> 00:48:45.670
B.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10626-0
00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:48.640
Correct, I agree.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10641-0
00:48:49.210 --> 00:48:53.620
Now the question is he 8 * X is
equal to B.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10635-0
00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:50.890
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10667-0
00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.582
Uh people think that in in case
A is square metrics, I can

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10667-1
00:48:58.582 --> 00:49:01.300
invert it and do all these
things.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10676-0
00:49:01.310 --> 00:49:05.160
But then in most of the cases
M&amp;N are different.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10696-0
00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:10.498
So you've got inverter nonsquare
matrix, so it becomes little

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10696-1
00:49:10.498 --> 00:49:11.270
tight for us.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10716-0
00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:17.946
Now if M is ¥10,000 is 15,000
and even to check the solution

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10716-1
00:49:17.946 --> 00:49:20.460
becomes very difficult.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10739-0
00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:23.376
So that's what we're going to
see in the first part of the

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10735-0
00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:21.550
That's what they.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10739-1
00:49:23.376 --> 00:49:23.770
lecture.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10753-0
00:49:24.990 --> 00:49:26.420
OK, this motivation is clear.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10754-0
00:49:25.450 --> 00:49:25.980
I'm sorry.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10789-0
00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:32.250
I said, yeah, 11, just one small
question that the when you wrote

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10764-0
00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:28.430
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10789-1
00:49:32.250 --> 00:49:36.900
the first expression like this
big under big comma this is in

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10778-0
00:49:33.590 --> 00:49:33.750
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10789-2
00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:38.400
2X right or comma X?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10793-0
00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:40.480
Yeah. Why comma?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10813-0
00:49:40.530 --> 00:49:42.790
No, no, I this is a semi colon
not comma.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10811-0
00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:43.990
Just any come.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10824-0
00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:44.730
OK, OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10827-0
00:49:44.910 --> 00:49:46.370
That this is a semicolon.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10832-0
00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:47.460
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10833-0
00:49:47.490 --> 00:49:48.850
This is a separator, sorry.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10844-0
00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:54.250
I'm the denoting by a this
matrix.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10848-0
00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:55.630
Ah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10861-0
00:49:56.460 --> 00:49:58.380
This matrix is donated today.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10887-0
00:49:58.390 --> 00:50:04.458
The denoted by this vector is
donated, denoted by X, and this

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10887-1
00:50:04.458 --> 00:50:07.590
vector is donated, denoted by B.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10899-0
00:50:07.890 --> 00:50:10.000
So you get the system AX equal
to B.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10914-0
00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:13.140
There is nothing like a comma,
semicolon, et cetera here.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10935-0
00:50:13.150 --> 00:50:13.920
Maybe I'll remove this.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10942-0
00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:16.270
In the current problem.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10926-0
00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:15.050
It was there.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10945-0
00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:16.730
That's why I got confused.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10962-0
00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:21.718
This is the matrix vector
product which will give you this

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10953-0
00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:19.220
The current problem would.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10962-1
00:50:21.718 --> 00:50:23.040
AX equal to B agree.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10982-0
00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:25.500
Yes, yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10980-0
00:50:24.990 --> 00:50:25.290
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10987-0
00:50:25.110 --> 00:50:27.390
Wouldn't it be the transpose of
this matrix here?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/10986-0
00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:26.490
What grant?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11006-0
00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:31.160
This current problem you have
set up to the transpose right.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11018-0
00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:33.440
The equations we had.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11063-0
00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:36.131
No, no, I no, no, I the previous
problem is over the previous

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11063-1
00:50:36.131 --> 00:50:39.603
problem is just to give you the
previous problem is just to give

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11033-0
00:50:37.270 --> 00:50:37.400
But.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11063-2
00:50:39.603 --> 00:50:42.968
you that anything in the in the
in the modeling part will give

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11063-3
00:50:42.968 --> 00:50:44.090
you give raise to it.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11069-0
00:50:42.970 --> 00:50:44.600
OK, I understand.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11074-0
00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:45.200
It will set up equations, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11088-0
00:50:45.730 --> 00:50:48.730
So in the previous problem,
actually the transpose, but

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11088-1
00:50:48.730 --> 00:50:50.660
right I was just thinking that
one.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11097-0
00:50:50.670 --> 00:50:51.230
Yeah, this is fine.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11098-0
00:50:51.970 --> 00:50:52.380
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11107-0
00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:53.920
But I am just trying to the
nature.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11117-0
00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:56.360
So if you're one part of it is.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11133-0
00:50:56.370 --> 00:50:58.869
I'm telling you that you will
get into a linear system of

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11133-1
00:50:58.869 --> 00:50:59.300
equations.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11154-0
00:50:59.310 --> 00:51:01.995
Second part is I'm trying to
tell you saying that what is it

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11154-1
00:51:01.995 --> 00:51:03.140
that we are interested in?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11164-0
00:51:03.690 --> 00:51:05.710
We are interested in the nature
of solutions.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11191-0
00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:08.797
How many solutions we have,
whether it has some solution at

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11191-1
00:51:08.797 --> 00:51:12.080
all or it has no solutions or it
has infinitely many solutions.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11204-0
00:51:12.210 --> 00:51:15.100
So this is what we will bother
about in the first part.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11215-0
00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:18.820
Now I will give you examples.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11223-0
00:51:19.390 --> 00:51:21.140
I this is a three by three
system.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11232-0
00:51:21.150 --> 00:51:22.720
You will say that it is easily
solvable.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11238-0
00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:24.970
Uh, you can easily see that.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11269-0
00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:30.757
If you add the 1st and the 2nd
equation, you add the 1st and

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11269-1
00:51:30.757 --> 00:51:33.500
the 2nd equation, there is a + X
two and a -.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11286-0
00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:37.910
X2 they cancel each other, so
you'll get 2X1 plus 3X3 equal

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11286-1
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:38.130
to.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11290-0
00:51:40.210 --> 00:51:40.920
Fight correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11291-0
00:51:40.990 --> 00:51:41.230
Right.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11296-0
00:51:43.490 --> 00:51:43.790
Agree.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11299-0
00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:44.770
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11307-0
00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:45.340
Yes, yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11330-0
00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:51.120
There's 2X1 plus, 3X3 is made
equal to 1 in the last equation.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11316-0
00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:46.830
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11348-0
00:51:51.130 --> 00:51:54.860
So can 2X1 plus 3X3B equal to
five and one at the same time?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11350-0
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:56.180
No.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11351-0
00:51:56.750 --> 00:51:56.890
No.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11362-0
00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:02.630
So these are examples where you
don't get any solutions agree.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11372-0
00:52:04.510 --> 00:52:04.810
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11370-0
00:52:04.620 --> 00:52:05.050
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11376-0
00:52:04.770 --> 00:52:05.180
Got it.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11374-0
00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:05.610
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11379-0
00:52:05.550 --> 00:52:06.520
OK, now.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11380-0
00:52:06.610 --> 00:52:06.950
Thanks.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11390-0
00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:12.330
You go to the next set now here.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11397-0
00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:16.550
What do we see?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11412-0
00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:20.890
You see, the last equation to be
X2 plus X3 equal to two.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11429-0
00:52:21.450 --> 00:52:24.362
Now you substitute X2 plus X3
equal to two in the first

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11429-1
00:52:24.362 --> 00:52:24.830
equation.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11440-0
00:52:25.790 --> 00:52:26.910
Do you get X1 equal to 1?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11448-0
00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:29.200
Connect X1 equal to 1.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11453-0
00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:30.000
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11484-0
00:52:30.110 --> 00:52:34.938
So OK, so EX1 equal to 1, so you
can now have a the second

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11484-1
00:52:34.938 --> 00:52:40.094
equation and the first equation
to give you the A somebody has

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11484-2
00:52:40.094 --> 00:52:42.550
not put their systems on mute.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11493-0
00:52:44.610 --> 00:52:45.070
OK, fine.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11503-0
00:52:46.110 --> 00:52:46.850
Now you put eggs.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11516-0
00:52:46.330 --> 00:52:51.270
So here it seems like the value
of X is 1 only whether it is.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11523-0
00:52:50.850 --> 00:52:52.390
Not exit X1.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11527-0
00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:54.900
X1 X 2X3 all are one.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11533-0
00:52:56.290 --> 00:53:00.360
I. No, yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11541-0
00:52:59.240 --> 00:52:59.870
3 counts.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11544-0
00:53:00.370 --> 00:53:01.720
Yeah, that is that is there.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11573-0
00:53:01.790 --> 00:53:05.104
But I'm what I'm saying trying
to say is you use exclusively

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11573-1
00:53:05.104 --> 00:53:08.418
the third equation, the first
equation you will get X1 equal

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11573-2
00:53:08.418 --> 00:53:08.690
to 1.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11575-0
00:53:10.010 --> 00:53:10.340
Right.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11594-0
00:53:10.110 --> 00:53:12.410
Party question, first equation.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11589-0
00:53:12.070 --> 00:53:13.280
The 30, yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11596-0
00:53:12.090 --> 00:53:12.510
Except.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11630-0
00:53:13.290 --> 00:53:16.979
If you put the third equation,
the first equation wherever X2

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11630-1
00:53:16.979 --> 00:53:20.550
plus X3 is there, you put two,
then X 1 + 2 equal to three,

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11630-2
00:53:20.550 --> 00:53:23.050
which will give you X1 equal to
1. Agree.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11635-0
00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:24.790
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11642-0
00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:25.260
Yes, yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11678-0
00:53:25.930 --> 00:53:30.055
Now the second one is if you put
X1 equal to 1 in the second

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11678-1
00:53:30.055 --> 00:53:34.247
equation, what will happen is
you will find minus X2 plus 2X3

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11678-2
00:53:34.247 --> 00:53:35.600
equal to 1, correct?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11680-0
00:53:36.730 --> 00:53:37.160
Correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11684-0
00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:37.340
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11686-0
00:53:38.070 --> 00:53:38.250
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11716-0
00:53:38.070 --> 00:53:45.623
OK, now, now you have minus X2
plus 2X3 equal to 1 X 2 + X

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11693-0
00:53:39.150 --> 00:53:39.350
Yep.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11716-1
00:53:45.623 --> 00:53:48.440
three is equal to two.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11737-0
00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:54.630
This will both give you
something like 3X3 if you add.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11742-0
00:53:53.290 --> 00:53:53.830
Equal to 1.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11747-0
00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:54.010
I.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11774-0
00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:57.301
If you add the two of them,
you'll get 3X3 equal to three,

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11769-0
00:53:56.790 --> 00:53:58.140
63423.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11774-1
00:53:57.301 --> 00:53:58.880
which will give you X3 equal to
1.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11772-0
00:53:59.420 --> 00:53:59.600
1.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11790-0
00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:00.970
Yes, yes, yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11795-0
00:54:00.740 --> 00:54:01.600
Correct, correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11811-0
00:54:01.050 --> 00:54:04.687
Now if you put the X3 equal to 1
in the last equation, you will

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11811-1
00:54:04.687 --> 00:54:05.710
get X2 equal to 1.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11817-0
00:54:06.290 --> 00:54:07.030
One yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11821-0
00:54:07.270 --> 00:54:07.480
Correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11853-0
00:54:07.350 --> 00:54:11.459
So you so you are right that you
will get a next one equal to X2

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11853-1
00:54:11.459 --> 00:54:15.380
equal to X3 equal to 1 and this
is the only solution correct?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11862-0
00:54:16.270 --> 00:54:16.690
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11889-0
00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:20.469
So the previous example is 1
where you have no solutions

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11867-0
00:54:17.170 --> 00:54:17.570
This.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11889-1
00:54:20.469 --> 00:54:23.486
because we have the same
equation representing 2

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11889-2
00:54:23.486 --> 00:54:25.580
constants on the right hand
side.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11970-0
00:54:25.590 --> 00:54:31.359
Here is a case where you have a
simple solution is the third one

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11970-1
00:54:31.359 --> 00:54:36.950
is something where you have two
X 1 + 3 X 3 equal to five, and

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11970-2
00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:42.630
if you just add the 1st and 2nd
equation X1 plus X2 plus X3 and

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11970-3
00:54:42.630 --> 00:54:48.222
X1 minus X2 plus 2X3, you will
find that you will get 2X1 plus

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11970-4
00:54:48.222 --> 00:54:49.820
3X3 equal to five.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11996-0
00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:54.151
So in essence, while you see
that there are three equations

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11996-1
00:54:54.151 --> 00:54:58.008
exclusively, there are only two
equations which are conveying

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/11996-2
00:54:58.008 --> 00:54:58.630
something.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12006-0
00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:00.570
The third one is called the
redundant condition, right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12018-0
00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:02.710
Yes. Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12017-0
00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:02.510
Correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12033-0
00:55:02.540 --> 00:55:06.723
I think we had first and second
the question that's for first

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12033-1
00:55:06.723 --> 00:55:08.680
and second, this one formula.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12048-0
00:55:08.690 --> 00:55:12.760
Then we will get 2X1UH plus 3X3.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12060-0
00:55:13.330 --> 00:55:13.960
Equal to five.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12067-0
00:55:14.660 --> 00:55:15.730
Equal to 5, yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12064-0
00:55:15.070 --> 00:55:15.260
I.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12069-0
00:55:15.670 --> 00:55:16.800
That is the third equation.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12086-0
00:55:16.810 --> 00:55:19.579
Unfortunately, the first two are
not conveying anything more than

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12086-1
00:55:19.579 --> 00:55:20.670
the third equation, right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12091-0
00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:21.850
But uh-huh.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12105-0
00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:27.520
So this is 1 case where I will
not be able to solve.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12124-0
00:55:27.530 --> 00:55:30.740
So I what I'm getting is 2 X 1 +
3 X 3 equal to five.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12131-0
00:55:30.750 --> 00:55:33.690
Is the only solution I'm getting
now?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12153-0
00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:37.446
How do I solve this system is if
you have seen lecture zero, I

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12153-1
00:55:37.446 --> 00:55:39.230
will give one arbitrary value.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12160-0
00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:40.250
Should I do it in my notebook?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12188-0
00:55:42.780 --> 00:55:45.817
I think we can go back and look
at the 0 recording maybe for

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12175-0
00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:43.340
Yeah, fine.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12188-1
00:55:45.817 --> 00:55:47.510
this because this is basic
right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12193-0
00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:48.430
Character.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12200-0
00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:48.620
It's probably more.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12243-0
00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:52.665
So if you have, if you have
something like 2X1 plus 3X3

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12243-1
00:55:52.665 --> 00:55:57.344
equal to five and this is the
equation to solve, you give one

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12243-2
00:55:57.344 --> 00:56:02.173
arbitrary value, let's say X3,
equal to T is 1 value, I'm going

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12243-3
00:56:02.173 --> 00:56:03.230
to give to X3.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12253-0
00:56:03.540 --> 00:56:04.850
Then what is my 2X1?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12262-0
00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:07.060
This is nothing but 5 -, 3 T,
correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12293-0
00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:13.230
Are X1 is nothing but 5 by 2 -,
3 by two T, correct?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12275-0
00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:09.560
Correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12298-0
00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:15.610
But correct so I am.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12300-0
00:56:14.190 --> 00:56:14.620
Yes, I'm.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12291-0
00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:14.690
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12301-0
00:56:14.730 --> 00:56:15.570
Yes, so.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12333-0
00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:22.234
Getting uh one form for X1 when
I assume one value for X3 Now

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12333-1
00:56:22.234 --> 00:56:28.490
because I know X1 and X3 I can
get my value of X2 correct?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12336-0
00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:30.800
Correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12348-0
00:56:31.790 --> 00:56:32.130
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12372-0
00:56:31.870 --> 00:56:35.472
I know this X1 in terms of TI
know X3 in terms of T so I can

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12372-1
00:56:35.472 --> 00:56:37.480
get X2 also in terms of T,
right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12381-0
00:56:38.590 --> 00:56:39.190
Correct, yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12411-0
00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:47.889
So if I put it here X 1 -, X two
plus 2X3X1 X 1 -, X, two plus

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12411-1
00:56:47.889 --> 00:56:51.250
2X3 equal to two, I will.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12421-0
00:56:51.370 --> 00:56:53.070
I want to find out what is my
ex.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12453-0
00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:58.310
Two, this is nothing but X1,
which is 5 by 2 -, 3 by two T

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12453-1
00:56:58.310 --> 00:57:03.630
and you bring this minus two
here it'll be here plus 2 * 3.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12461-0
00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:04.960
This is equal to X, so correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12469-0
00:57:06.270 --> 00:57:07.040
Correct, yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12499-0
00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:12.835
So five by two is 2 1/2 -, 2 is
half, half, and then two t -, 3

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12499-1
00:57:12.835 --> 00:57:17.180
by two it is half T this is
equal to X store, correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12535-0
00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:23.746
So this expression I'm not able
to understand like after the X1

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12535-1
00:57:23.746 --> 00:57:26.240
minus X25 by two by three minus.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12532-0
00:57:25.710 --> 00:57:27.400
No X1, only X1.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12539-0
00:57:27.410 --> 00:57:28.590
I've already got the value
right.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12557-0
00:57:29.340 --> 00:57:29.650
Ah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12566-0
00:57:30.930 --> 00:57:35.360
This is X1 value I have written
X1 wherever X1 is there I am.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12570-0
00:57:34.590 --> 00:57:35.110
OK, OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12578-0
00:57:35.370 --> 00:57:38.550
I would expect two to here and I
would this two here.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12595-0
00:57:44.110 --> 00:57:44.920
Focus on got it?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12606-0
00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:45.400
But yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12597-0
00:57:44.140 --> 00:57:44.650
Got it.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12604-0
00:57:44.540 --> 00:57:44.870
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12622-0
00:57:45.220 --> 00:57:49.390
OK, so this X2 is half plus half
T So what is my solution?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12610-0
00:57:45.790 --> 00:57:46.130
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12656-0
00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:56.965
Looking like 5 by 2 -, 3 by 2D
and then X2 is nothing but half

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12656-1
00:57:56.965 --> 00:58:03.090
plus half T and X3 is T this is
my X1 X 2X3 agree.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12662-0
00:58:05.030 --> 00:58:05.280
That.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12680-0
00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:09.710
So I say, I say very, I say very
tea.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12672-0
00:58:06.770 --> 00:58:07.090
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12673-0
00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:07.520
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12685-0
00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:11.590
I get infinitely many solutions
correct?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12689-0
00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:13.830
Right.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12688-0
00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:13.860
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12733-0
00:58:17.210 --> 00:58:21.341
So I can put equal to 0 T equal
to 1, T equal to T equal to 3T,

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12733-1
00:58:21.341 --> 00:58:25.342
equal to 3.5 T equal to 7.86 you
get put all the values of it

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12733-2
00:58:25.342 --> 00:58:27.860
keep satisfying these three
equations.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12746-0
00:58:28.010 --> 00:58:29.880
So you get infinitely many
solutions.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12772-0
00:58:30.270 --> 00:58:34.619
So the crux what you have solved
is that system of equations

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12772-1
00:58:34.619 --> 00:58:39.040
either has a unique solution or
infinitely many solutions or.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12783-0
00:58:41.060 --> 00:58:41.820
No solution.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12790-0
00:58:41.930 --> 00:58:42.600
No solutions.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12786-0
00:58:41.940 --> 00:58:43.110
On unsolved.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12800-0
00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:44.560
Yeah, unsold the thing.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12802-0
00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:45.040
Yeah, correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12810-0
00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:47.480
Sir, can you please go to the
class note?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12814-0
00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:49.150
There, sorry if you do.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12843-0
00:58:49.230 --> 00:58:54.106
If you put the X1 X 2X3 value in
equation one, you can get the

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12836-0
00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:53.830
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12843-1
00:58:54.106 --> 00:58:55.500
value of T, right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12844-0
00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:57.170
No, no, you cannot tell.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12855-0
00:58:59.350 --> 00:59:01.260
So can you move a little bit of
upward?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12877-0
00:59:01.350 --> 00:59:06.653
I just want to get the two X1 5
-, 3 T, X1 is equal to OK got

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12877-1
00:59:06.653 --> 00:59:06.910
it.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12892-0
00:59:07.690 --> 00:59:08.630
You have just simplified.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12893-0
00:59:07.890 --> 00:59:10.350
You are going to get constant
equal to a constant.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12916-0
00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:17.792
You can never get the value of T
you can keep the value of T to

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12916-1
00:59:17.792 --> 00:59:18.360
be arbitrary.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12921-0
00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:19.660
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12923-0
00:59:19.510 --> 00:59:20.800
No, no, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12942-0
00:59:20.850 --> 00:59:24.117
If you we have express y + Z
equal to two, I think that is

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12942-1
00:59:24.117 --> 00:59:25.170
the first equation.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12943-0
00:59:24.850 --> 00:59:26.060
Right, right.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12969-0
00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:30.920
OK, X1 plus X2 plus X3 equal to
three, yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12956-0
00:59:28.020 --> 00:59:28.230
It's.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12967-0
00:59:30.770 --> 00:59:31.550
Equal to three.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13007-0
00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:36.539
If we put all T values in place
of X1X2 and X3, we will get the

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13007-1
00:59:36.539 --> 00:59:37.240
value of.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/12996-0
00:59:36.820 --> 00:59:37.610
I I never mind.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13005-0
00:59:37.620 --> 00:59:38.670
That's what I'm telling you.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13017-0
00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:39.950
There is a half a tea here.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13039-0
00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:43.482
If you add it to tea, it'll be
three by two T This will cancel

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13039-1
00:59:43.482 --> 00:59:44.600
this three by two T.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13047-0
00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:46.320
Ohk OK, OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13059-0
00:59:46.780 --> 00:59:49.340
And five by two plus half is 6
by two which is 3.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13068-0
00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:51.590
OK, got it.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13088-0
00:59:51.950 --> 00:59:54.874
So you the T is not going to
remain if the T remains, then

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13088-1
00:59:54.874 --> 00:59:57.700
you can get the value of T But
the T will get cancelled.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13090-0
00:59:57.770 --> 00:59:57.940
Good.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13111-0
00:59:59.310 --> 00:59:59.640
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13101-0
00:59:59.950 --> 01:00:01.420
By the precise nature of
equation.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13113-0
01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:03.020
So you will not get it take
anything.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13131-0
01:00:03.030 --> 01:00:05.510
Anyway, it's good that you asked
me tickets.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13124-0
01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:05.330
So.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13153-0
01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:08.851
So does that mean we can assign
any value to T and that means

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13153-1
01:00:08.851 --> 01:00:11.570
that is why we have infinite
solutions to this?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13156-0
01:00:12.050 --> 01:00:13.700
Yeah, you give me one value of
tea.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13177-0
01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:14.850
I will tell you how this is.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13169-0
01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:15.600
Yeah, I mean I.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13204-0
01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:19.236
Yeah, I can see you can assign
one till any number and probably

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13195-0
01:00:18.390 --> 01:00:19.780
Yeah, you cannot say any number.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13204-1
01:00:19.236 --> 01:00:20.240
you will get yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13212-0
01:00:19.790 --> 01:00:23.460
Maybe minus 666.6667 you will
solve this.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13218-0
01:00:24.730 --> 01:00:25.000
Correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13223-0
01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:27.440
Infinitely many solutions are
there.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13226-0
01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:28.660
Makes sense?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13257-0
01:00:29.550 --> 01:00:34.381
OK, now uh, the point is, how
did we arrive at all these

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13257-1
01:00:34.381 --> 01:00:39.466
solutions and how is it that we
can we can get to this very

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13257-2
01:00:39.466 --> 01:00:40.060
easily?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13269-0
01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:42.640
How will you identify the free
variable, et cetera.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13296-0
01:00:43.070 --> 01:00:46.125
These are big questions and we
are going to do something called

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13296-1
01:00:46.125 --> 01:00:48.990
as those in elimination method
and the Ghost Jordan method.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13331-0
01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.521
That's towards the end of this
course ends up this lecture and

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13331-1
01:00:52.521 --> 01:00:55.540
we will try to see how we can
get this quite quickly.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13345-0
01:00:56.380 --> 01:00:59.780
Ticket in Lecture 0 I had
written saying that, you know

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13345-1
01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:01.420
the concept of rank, right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13380-0
01:01:04.490 --> 01:01:09.777
So if you have the system AX
equal to B and as long as the

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13380-1
01:01:09.777 --> 01:01:15.243
rank of A is equal to rank of
AB, then you have at least one

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13380-2
01:01:15.243 --> 01:01:16.050
solution.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13424-0
01:01:20.070 --> 01:01:23.610
Now you can check up the the,
the the definition of rank in

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13424-1
01:01:23.610 --> 01:01:27.150
your in from Lecture 0 and if
there is some problem you can

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13424-2
01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:30.690
tell me the next class I will be
willing to clear that out.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13427-0
01:01:30.930 --> 01:01:31.650
OK, fine.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13437-0
01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:35.470
Now this is a geometric
interpretation.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13442-0
01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:36.670
What is geometric
interpretation?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13480-0
01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:39.743
It interpretation says when two
lines meet then that becomes

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13480-1
01:01:39.743 --> 01:01:42.705
solution because this is one
point which is common to this

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13480-2
01:01:42.705 --> 01:01:45.718
line as well as this line and
you'll get a unique solution,

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13480-3
01:01:45.718 --> 01:01:46.120
correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13504-0
01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:52.790
Do we have lecture 0 as well for
this mathematical foundation?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13496-0
01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:49.760
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13501-0
01:01:50.830 --> 01:01:51.130
Listen.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13505-0
01:01:53.690 --> 01:01:54.150
What?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13514-0
01:01:54.250 --> 01:01:56.180
Yeah, it has been already
posted.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13518-0
01:01:56.190 --> 01:01:56.680
We have.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13524-0
01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:57.990
You're not able to locate it.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13530-0
01:01:59.060 --> 01:01:59.280
Uh.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13546-0
01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:05.830
Well, do we have a like a like
you have session right now?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13572-0
01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:08.180
Do we have lecture zero session
also before?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13568-0
01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:08.880
No lecture 0 yourself, study.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13579-0
01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:11.100
OK that that's fine.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13580-0
01:02:10.930 --> 01:02:11.880
Presentation mode.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13581-0
01:02:10.950 --> 01:02:12.570
Ohh self OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13598-0
01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:15.760
So the 2nd.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13591-0
01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:16.570
Uh, just to confirm, Sir?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13618-0
01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:20.258
Uh, the lecture zero was the
Python training that was earlier

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13610-0
01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:20.970
No, no, no, no.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13618-1
01:02:20.258 --> 01:02:20.610
given.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13631-0
01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:24.742
For for mathematical foundations
I had created a deck and I had

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13631-1
01:02:24.742 --> 01:02:25.330
posted it.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13634-0
01:02:26.090 --> 01:02:27.520
OK. OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13641-0
01:02:27.590 --> 01:02:27.910
Thank you.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13646-0
01:02:27.730 --> 01:02:28.180
Awesome.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13655-0
01:02:29.170 --> 01:02:31.410
Some people serving you.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13667-0
01:02:30.270 --> 01:02:31.550
You are not able to see the.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13670-0
01:02:31.570 --> 01:02:33.340
Yeah, if it will, it will be
good.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13706-0
01:02:33.350 --> 01:02:36.989
If you have 1015 minutes of
overview of that one deputy so

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13706-1
01:02:36.989 --> 01:02:40.690
that there will be easy for
recall recapping of the things.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13696-0
01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:38.020
Or.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13702-0
01:02:40.290 --> 01:02:40.470
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13740-0
01:02:41.710 --> 01:02:46.481
OK, so this is the this is
announcement I have put that

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13715-0
01:02:42.430 --> 01:02:42.830
I.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13740-1
01:02:46.481 --> 01:02:51.849
basically NAGENDRA and you will
find lecture 0 dot PPT here in

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13740-2
01:02:51.849 --> 01:02:53.980
the announcement section.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13758-0
01:02:55.810 --> 01:02:56.850
Oh, we missed this.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13765-0
01:02:57.390 --> 01:02:58.380
Yeah. Wow.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13778-0
01:02:58.090 --> 01:03:02.962
How come there was one message
today also and asked my TS to

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13766-0
01:02:58.600 --> 01:02:59.300
Sorry for that.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13776-0
01:03:02.050 --> 01:03:02.520
Ohh.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13778-1
01:03:02.962 --> 01:03:04.240
put the message.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13806-0
01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:08.905
I think it would still be
better, Sir, if we can have a

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13806-1
01:03:08.905 --> 01:03:09.700
recapping here.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13865-0
01:03:10.730 --> 01:03:16.259
So for for me not showing up
this mathematical this the in

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13818-0
01:03:11.490 --> 01:03:12.280
None of this is new.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13865-1
01:03:16.259 --> 01:03:21.694
announcement in announcement
it's not showing showing two

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13837-0
01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:20.800
How come?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13865-2
01:03:21.694 --> 01:03:26.942
just basically 2 rows are
showing up FAQ for course MFD

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13865-3
01:03:26.942 --> 01:03:31.440
are you talking about the basic
linear algebra.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13867-0
01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:32.640
Yeah, that's what I'm talking
about.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13874-0
01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:33.750
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13888-0
01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:35.850
We're not showing on our side.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13883-0
01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:36.510
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13900-0
01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:38.260
Yes, there there is a different.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13889-0
01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:37.190
Yeah, it's showing now.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13906-0
01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:39.400
So, uh, sorry.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13905-0
01:03:37.830 --> 01:03:38.230
He's dead.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13913-0
01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:39.200
Yeah, so.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13909-0
01:03:39.410 --> 01:03:40.160
Sorry Venkat, right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13917-0
01:03:40.170 --> 01:03:41.680
So I personally failed, right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13932-0
01:03:41.690 --> 01:03:45.080
I mean relating the the jargons
that you're telling, right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13942-0
01:03:45.090 --> 01:03:46.190
I'll find it bit hard, right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13977-0
01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:49.342
If we can wrap up for 10-15
minutes, that really helps me as

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13957-0
01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:48.840
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13964-0
01:03:48.850 --> 01:03:49.950
So let's do it.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13977-1
01:03:49.342 --> 01:03:50.630
well as a couple of guys.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13980-0
01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:53.120
Let's let's do a let's do a
quick recap of 10 minutes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13993-0
01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:55.010
So now the time is 244.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/13997-0
01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:54.070
Right.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14003-0
01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:58.450
I'll finish it by 2:55 now.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14015-0
01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:00.690
Matrix is a structure which is
given this.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14026-0
01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:02.570
I have already explained how the
structure works.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14039-0
01:04:03.630 --> 01:04:07.320
Now the the the notation we give
is all capital letters.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14054-0
01:04:07.330 --> 01:04:10.640
Will denote such matrices and it
will have M rows and N columns.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14081-0
01:04:11.030 --> 01:04:14.600
Unless we say M equal to north
or something like that, it'll be

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14081-1
01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:17.110
a generic AA will have M rows
and N columns.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14089-0
01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:20.070
Now vector is for example.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14105-0
01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:22.610
It has only one row or it has
only one column.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14123-0
01:04:22.620 --> 01:04:25.164
So in this case A is called the
row vector and B is called the

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14123-1
01:04:25.164 --> 01:04:25.730
column vector.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14134-0
01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:27.370
It has only one column or one
row.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14151-0
01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:31.176
Now equality of matrix when you
want talking equality of

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14151-1
01:04:31.176 --> 01:04:31.570
matrices.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14180-0
01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:34.477
First of all, the size should be
the same and all the

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14180-1
01:04:34.477 --> 01:04:37.964
corresponding elements should be
same, in which case we call the

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14180-2
01:04:37.964 --> 01:04:38.930
matrices as equal.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14190-0
01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:43.110
You can add A and B in neither
way.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14197-0
01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:45.210
B plus.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14205-0
01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:45.830
Yeah, same.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14215-0
01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:48.310
As long as they are of the same
size, say.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14235-0
01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:51.104
Similarly, if you ABC are of the
same size, you can add in

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14235-1
01:04:51.104 --> 01:04:52.190
whichever way you want.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14276-0
01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:55.606
First you add A+B and then to
see RA to B + C you will get

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14276-1
01:04:55.606 --> 01:04:59.069
always get the same result by
adding what I mean is you are

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14276-2
01:04:59.069 --> 01:05:01.090
adding the corresponding
elements.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14318-0
01:05:02.810 --> 01:05:06.682
The Zero matrix is 1 which can
be added to any matrix of the

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14318-1
01:05:06.682 --> 01:05:10.809
same size to get A and for every
a there is a negative A so that

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14318-2
01:05:10.809 --> 01:05:13.920
if you add AA to negative you
get a zero matrix.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14335-0
01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:17.760
See, when we write these
matrices, the zero will imply it

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14335-1
01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:18.480
is a matrix.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14354-0
01:05:18.750 --> 01:05:23.216
Don't think when you subtract
from a another a you're going to

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14354-1
01:05:23.216 --> 01:05:24.280
get a 0 scalar.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14360-0
01:05:24.350 --> 01:05:25.780
It is a zero matrix. Agree.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14373-0
01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:29.110
Yes, that's correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14369-0
01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:29.370
I.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14375-0
01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:29.430
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14378-0
01:05:29.580 --> 01:05:29.930
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14396-0
01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:34.920
Now is Taylor C * A + B is
nothing but C * A + C * B.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14427-0
01:05:35.230 --> 01:05:41.586
You can add 2 scalar C + K * A
which is CA plus KAC times, KCK

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14427-1
01:05:41.586 --> 01:05:43.100
and 1 * A is a.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14431-0
01:05:43.110 --> 01:05:44.380
This one is a scalar.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14437-0
01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:45.850
This is not a matrix.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14486-0
01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:52.437
OK, now matrix multiplication
is, you know that if you have

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14449-0
01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:50.460
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14486-1
01:05:52.437 --> 01:05:56.443
A&amp;B are two matrices where
the number of columns of A and

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14486-2
01:05:56.443 --> 01:06:00.643
the number of rows of B are the
same, then you can multiply have

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14486-3
01:06:00.643 --> 01:06:02.130
written it very neatly.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14531-0
01:06:02.140 --> 01:06:05.451
Here you can multiply M cross
and matrix only with the North

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14531-1
01:06:05.451 --> 01:06:08.763
Cross P because the number of
columns of A and the number of

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14531-2
01:06:08.763 --> 01:06:12.347
rows of B should be the same and
this will give a matrix which is

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14531-3
01:06:12.347 --> 01:06:12.890
M cross B.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14541-0
01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:15.330
The north is forgotten here in
the product.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14551-0
01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:18.340
Now that is what will give me
the C agree.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14554-0
01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:19.280
Right.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14566-0
01:06:20.270 --> 01:06:21.430
Now, how do you do this?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14568-0
01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:20.450
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14569-0
01:06:20.460 --> 01:06:20.830
Uh, yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14571-0
01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:20.950
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14597-0
01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:26.242
You take the I's row and the the
JTH row and the Keith column and

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14597-1
01:06:26.242 --> 01:06:29.880
you start multiplying the
elements and adding it.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14602-0
01:06:29.890 --> 01:06:30.420
You will get it.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14611-0
01:06:30.430 --> 01:06:31.770
I have done a small example.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14630-0
01:06:32.010 --> 01:06:35.315
For example, you want to get the
the two three element that is

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14630-1
01:06:35.315 --> 01:06:37.100
second row, third column
element.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14644-0
01:06:37.310 --> 01:06:40.619
You take the 2nd row, element
the the vector here and the

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14644-1
01:06:40.619 --> 01:06:41.760
third column vector.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14669-0
01:06:41.770 --> 01:06:47.121
Here you multiply them four into
three is 12, zero to 7 is 02,

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14669-1
01:06:47.121 --> 01:06:48.310
into one is 2.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14686-0
01:06:48.610 --> 01:06:52.660
So for 12 + 2 is 14, so that's
how you get the 14 here agreed.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14694-0
01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:53.990
Right.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14702-0
01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:56.270
This made his multiplication.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14704-0
01:06:55.070 --> 01:06:56.220
Yes, Sir. Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14700-0
01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:55.570
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14723-0
01:06:57.060 --> 01:07:02.071
If you multiply 2 matrices one
100 hundred and this, you will

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14723-1
01:07:02.071 --> 01:07:03.850
get a zero matrix and.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14749-0
01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:08.757
But if you do it in the reverse
direction, you'll get a 9999 -,

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14749-1
01:07:08.757 --> 01:07:09.440
99 -, 99.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14760-0
01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:11.930
This is to illustrate 2 things
here.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14785-0
01:07:11.940 --> 01:07:15.890
When you multiply 2 things
A&amp;B, it is not the same as B

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14785-1
01:07:15.890 --> 01:07:19.840
into a a into B-0000, whereas B
into a something different.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14801-0
01:07:20.180 --> 01:07:23.024
So don't think that you can
multiply in whichever way you

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14801-1
01:07:23.024 --> 01:07:23.270
want.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14838-0
01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:27.258
Multiplying a with B&amp;B with
a are two different things, OK,

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14838-1
01:07:27.258 --> 01:07:31.073
and when you get the product as
zero doesn't mean that one of

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14838-2
01:07:31.073 --> 01:07:34.150
the matrices is 0, which is
happening in scalars.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14860-0
01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:37.520
If you multiply 2 scalars and
get a zero, it necessarily means

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14860-1
01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:39.700
there are at least one of them
is 0, right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14872-0
01:07:41.950 --> 01:07:43.250
Correct, correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14878-0
01:07:42.830 --> 01:07:42.930
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14879-0
01:07:42.830 --> 01:07:43.150
Right.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14882-0
01:07:43.070 --> 01:07:44.780
But that is not the case with
matrices.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14876-0
01:07:43.830 --> 01:07:44.050
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14891-0
01:07:45.010 --> 01:07:46.800
You see, this is a non zero
matrix.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14906-0
01:07:46.810 --> 01:07:49.120
This is a nonzero matrix, but
when you multiply you get a 0.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14922-0
01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:54.635
Uh transpose means you change
the rows to columns and columns

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14922-1
01:07:54.635 --> 01:07:55.050
to rows.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14944-0
01:07:55.060 --> 01:07:58.649
What you get is a transpose
matrix is, so this is a

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14944-1
01:07:58.649 --> 01:08:00.030
transpose the stuff.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14959-0
01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:03.190
So you A11, usually a 12 should
be here.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14974-0
01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:05.777
So we have interchanged all
those things, the rows and the

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14974-1
01:08:05.777 --> 01:08:06.870
columns are interchanged.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14978-0
01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:08.350
So this is a transpose.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/14987-0
01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:12.210
Now transpose follows 4 simple
rules.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15029-0
01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:17.162
If you transpose it two times,
you get back the original matrix

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15029-1
01:08:17.162 --> 01:08:21.165
addition will be you add a
transpose B transpose effect of

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15029-2
01:08:21.165 --> 01:08:25.100
a constant is not there as far
as transpose is concerned.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15042-0
01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:28.987
And finally, the product A/B
transpose is B transpose A

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15042-1
01:08:28.987 --> 01:08:29.610
transpose.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15062-0
01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:33.691
This is the D party, something
which you'll be using quite

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15062-1
01:08:33.691 --> 01:08:34.470
often in our.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15079-0
01:08:34.570 --> 01:08:38.631
In our analysis, there are
special matrices, something

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15079-1
01:08:38.631 --> 01:08:41.880
called symmetric, where you know
the above.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15105-0
01:08:41.890 --> 01:08:44.897
The main dangling below the main
diagonal, you have the same

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15105-1
01:08:44.897 --> 01:08:47.757
element, so you find this one
and this one are there this

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15105-2
01:08:47.757 --> 01:08:48.250
minus one?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15115-0
01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:51.770
This minus one zero and zero
right elements can be anything.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15123-0
01:08:52.310 --> 01:08:54.280
There is something else too
symmetric where.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15133-0
01:08:55.090 --> 01:08:56.120
How about the main diagonal?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15168-0
01:08:56.130 --> 01:08:59.041
Whatever element is there below
the main diagonal, the negative

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15168-1
01:08:59.041 --> 01:09:01.497
of that number will be there,
and because of the skew

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15168-2
01:09:01.497 --> 01:09:03.590
symmetric property, always the
diagonal is 0.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15190-0
01:09:04.490 --> 01:09:08.616
There is something called upper
triangular where and when you

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15190-1
01:09:08.616 --> 01:09:12.210
find below the main diagonal,
all elements are zeros.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15217-0
01:09:12.270 --> 01:09:14.987
This is very important and there
is something called lower

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15217-1
01:09:14.987 --> 01:09:17.843
triangular where above the main
diagonal all the elements are

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15217-2
01:09:17.843 --> 01:09:18.120
zeros.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15237-0
01:09:19.290 --> 01:09:23.079
That is a diagonal matrix where
only the diagonal elements are

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15237-1
01:09:23.079 --> 01:09:23.440
depth.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15257-0
01:09:23.450 --> 01:09:26.420
Some of them can be zero also,
but anything below and above the

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15257-1
01:09:26.420 --> 01:09:27.720
main diagonals and be zeros.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15286-0
01:09:28.510 --> 01:09:31.534
There's a sparse matrix where
there are many zeros and a few

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15286-1
01:09:31.534 --> 01:09:34.460
nonzero entries, so we are given
examples for all of them.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15301-0
01:09:34.850 --> 01:09:38.708
Now we'll be using semantics
queue, symmetric, triangular,

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15301-1
01:09:38.708 --> 01:09:40.540
diagonal, and except sparse.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15318-0
01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:44.228
Maybe not that much of sparse,
but other things you'll be using

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15318-1
01:09:44.228 --> 01:09:45.320
it quite regularly.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15365-0
01:09:45.910 --> 01:09:50.004
Now there is something called
positive definite matrix which

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15365-1
01:09:50.004 --> 01:09:54.032
simply says that you take an X
uh proportion to the size of

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15365-2
01:09:54.032 --> 01:09:58.059
yeah, the number of rows of yet
and then you take A to be a

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15365-3
01:09:58.059 --> 01:10:00.610
symmetric matrix, then extract
spose.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15392-0
01:10:00.670 --> 01:10:05.960
Eggs will be more than zero and
give it a simple example 26620.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15408-0
01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:10.440
You take an ** One X 226620 X
1X2.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15443-0
01:10:10.870 --> 01:10:14.030
Now X transpose X is going to be
a scalar, so this zero whatever

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15443-1
01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:16.510
your written on the right hand
side is a scalar 0.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15465-0
01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:22.075
If he expand this, you will get
2 * X one plus 3X2 whole squared

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15465-1
01:10:22.075 --> 01:10:23.010
plus 2X2 square.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15487-0
01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:26.628
Now you know that this is, uh,
this is something like, you

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15487-1
01:10:26.628 --> 01:10:28.830
know, this is square of a
quantity.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15494-0
01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:31.720
And so this will always be
positive.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15501-0
01:10:31.730 --> 01:10:32.950
This is also square of quantity.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15527-0
01:10:33.100 --> 01:10:36.833
Is also always positive, and
since X is not equal to 0, this

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15527-1
01:10:36.833 --> 01:10:39.710
number is going to be strictly
more than zero.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15549-0
01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:42.882
So this is called positive
definite when the same thing,

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15549-1
01:10:42.882 --> 01:10:45.070
you relax it to greater than
equal to 0.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15563-0
01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:49.100
Then you say that this is this
is positive, maybe definite.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15581-0
01:10:50.410 --> 01:10:53.660
In this case you get 2 * X one
plus 3X2 whole square.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15617-0
01:10:53.670 --> 01:10:58.839
Is this can be 0 for example for
a special case X1 is 3 and X2 is

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15617-1
01:10:58.839 --> 01:11:03.381
minus one very X1X2 are not
zeros but still this quantity

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15617-2
01:11:03.381 --> 01:11:04.400
can be zeros.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15635-0
01:11:04.810 --> 01:11:07.033
It can be a 0, so that's the
reason it is called positive

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15635-1
01:11:07.033 --> 01:11:07.570
semi definite.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15649-0
01:11:07.580 --> 01:11:10.650
Then there are three elementary
operations, yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15647-0
01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:09.990
Practically.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15658-0
01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:13.880
Practically, where do we use
this concept?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15664-0
01:11:15.150 --> 01:11:16.780
Symmetric positive definite
matrix, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15691-0
01:11:19.010 --> 01:11:21.650
And like any practical example
where we use the concept.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15681-0
01:11:19.310 --> 01:11:19.410
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15704-0
01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:24.531
We are going to use it in
gradient descent method where

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15704-1
01:11:24.531 --> 01:11:26.310
you want to find the minimum
immediately.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15712-0
01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:28.590
OK, got it.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15726-0
01:11:29.670 --> 01:11:32.450
In PCA, we are going to use it
in singular value decompose.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15730-0
01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:33.150
We are going to use it.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15747-0
01:11:35.730 --> 01:11:38.118
You can ask me in machine
learning where we don't use

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15747-1
01:11:38.118 --> 01:11:38.340
this.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15758-0
01:11:38.350 --> 01:11:39.660
I will not be able to give an
example.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15769-0
01:11:39.670 --> 01:11:42.070
We use it everywhere now.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15775-0
01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:42.660
Yeah, yeah, that.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15783-0
01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:45.689
There are made given a matrix,
there are three elementary row

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15783-1
01:11:45.689 --> 01:11:46.330
operations.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15816-0
01:11:46.340 --> 01:11:49.728
One is interchange of rows,
addition of a constant multiple

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15816-1
01:11:49.728 --> 01:11:53.172
of 1 row to another row and
multiplication of a row by a non

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15816-2
01:11:53.172 --> 01:11:53.850
0 constancy.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15835-0
01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:58.270
Now these are elementary
operations and they preserve.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15876-0
01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:01.553
For example, if you have a
system of equation that they may

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15876-1
01:12:01.553 --> 01:12:04.618
you take the matrix A along with
the right hand side and do all

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15876-2
01:12:04.618 --> 01:12:07.204
these things, the system, the
nature of the system of

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15876-3
01:12:07.204 --> 01:12:08.450
equations will not change.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15883-0
01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:12.010
Now these are called elementary
wall operations.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15900-0
01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:14.832
There is something called row
echelon form and a row reduced

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15900-1
01:12:14.832 --> 01:12:15.560
row echelon form.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15923-0
01:12:16.870 --> 01:12:20.280
I will touch upon this in the
lecture now, so I will leave it

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15923-1
01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:20.720
for now.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15941-0
01:12:21.250 --> 01:12:25.855
And this also I will do it rank
of a matrix is basically I will

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15941-1
01:12:25.855 --> 01:12:27.870
do this also a little later.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15948-0
01:12:28.710 --> 01:12:29.700
This is also.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15953-0
01:12:29.930 --> 01:12:31.460
Then there is determinant.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15964-0
01:12:31.470 --> 01:12:33.930
I find something called as a
minor determinant.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15978-0
01:12:33.940 --> 01:12:37.654
You know very clearly, so I will
not spend much time on

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15978-1
01:12:37.654 --> 01:12:38.450
determinant.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15982-0
01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:39.470
This may be I will.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/15991-0
01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:40.940
I don't need it for the present
class.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16014-0
01:12:41.130 --> 01:12:45.554
So you can you can for example
go through it later when you

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16014-1
01:12:45.554 --> 01:12:48.430
have time, adjoint, inverse,
etcetera.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16042-0
01:12:48.770 --> 01:12:52.177
I will not go through it now,
but you can go through this at

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16042-1
01:12:52.177 --> 01:12:55.584
your leisure because it is going
to be used only in the next

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16042-2
01:12:55.584 --> 01:12:55.920
class.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16053-0
01:12:56.530 --> 01:12:59.560
Uh, this is also not going to be
used now.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16085-0
01:12:59.570 --> 01:13:03.140
This linear system is anywhere
I'm going to cover it now, so

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16085-1
01:13:03.140 --> 01:13:06.653
the linear system in general, it
has the same form, a 11X1,

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16085-2
01:13:06.653 --> 01:13:07.180
etcetera.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16103-0
01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:11.565
So we represented as a X equal
to B and so this is the

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16103-1
01:13:11.565 --> 01:13:12.740
representation.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16152-0
01:13:13.230 --> 01:13:17.260
Now the question is that when
you have a X equal to B, we are

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16152-1
01:13:17.260 --> 01:13:21.225
going to use a concept of rank
which is going to say whether

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16152-2
01:13:21.225 --> 01:13:25.320
this is the rank of A and the
rank of A is going to be same or

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16152-3
01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:25.580
not.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16164-0
01:13:25.590 --> 01:13:27.520
Which I will do in the in the
present class.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16190-0
01:13:27.930 --> 01:13:30.935
So this is called the augmented
matrix, where you write the

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16190-1
01:13:30.935 --> 01:13:33.939
matrix A and with the dotted
line you write the elements of

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16190-2
01:13:33.939 --> 01:13:34.040
B.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16208-0
01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:37.227
So the size of this becomes the
same number of rows, but the

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16208-1
01:13:37.227 --> 01:13:39.240
number of columns is incremented
by 1.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16220-0
01:13:39.250 --> 01:13:40.210
So in this is n + 1.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16227-0
01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:45.950
Now OK, this is what we have.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16246-0
01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:49.155
They either it has no solution
or it has a unique solution, or

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16246-1
01:13:49.155 --> 01:13:50.880
it has infinitely many
solutions.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16276-0
01:13:50.890 --> 01:13:54.932
So this is what I have shown to
you in the in the in the in the

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16276-1
01:13:54.932 --> 01:13:57.080
example as, but now this is
1455.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16282-0
01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:58.420
I think we are back on track.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16291-0
01:13:59.150 --> 01:14:01.410
Have he that he's it.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16297-0
01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:03.110
Was it OK or too fast?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16311-0
01:14:06.890 --> 01:14:07.990
No, it's it's good, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16321-0
01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:07.700
OK, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16315-0
01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:08.690
This this.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16331-0
01:14:08.050 --> 01:14:08.800
It is some.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16338-0
01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:09.240
OK, fine. Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16325-0
01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:09.130
Is OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16335-0
01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:09.440
You know it's OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16333-0
01:14:09.260 --> 01:14:09.380
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16363-0
01:14:10.230 --> 01:14:15.185
OK, the second case is 1 where
one equation is the same as the

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16343-0
01:14:10.410 --> 01:14:10.690
Good.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16363-1
01:14:15.185 --> 01:14:19.040
other equation, so the lines
fall on each other.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16382-0
01:14:19.130 --> 01:14:21.936
So in such a case what we have
is we have infinitely many

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16382-1
01:14:21.936 --> 01:14:22.420
solutions.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16386-0
01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:23.420
A solution.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16399-0
01:14:23.430 --> 01:14:26.795
Please note a solution is set of
points where both the equations

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16399-1
01:14:26.795 --> 01:14:27.520
are satisfied.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16409-0
01:14:27.750 --> 01:14:29.850
You see this point which I have
marking here?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16437-0
01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:34.071
This is common to this 4X plus
4X2 equal to five and two X 1 -,

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16437-1
01:14:34.071 --> 01:14:35.180
4 X 2 equal to 1.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16445-0
01:14:35.190 --> 01:14:36.320
So this is called the solution.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16451-0
01:14:36.870 --> 01:14:38.200
Now here the line.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16468-0
01:14:38.550 --> 01:14:40.966
The first line lies on top of
the other lane, so you have

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16468-1
01:14:40.966 --> 01:14:42.050
infinitely many solutions.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16479-0
01:14:42.660 --> 01:14:45.090
There's a third case where they
don't meet at all.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16506-0
01:14:45.460 --> 01:14:49.059
OK, in such a case you find
there are no solutions because

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16506-1
01:14:49.059 --> 01:14:52.780
there is no common point where
both the epics are satisfied.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16523-0
01:14:54.420 --> 01:14:57.810
No 3D case or in hyper in in in.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16545-0
01:14:57.820 --> 01:15:02.027
In the ND case, you don't have
something like a line, but that

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16545-1
01:15:02.027 --> 01:15:03.430
is called hyperplane.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16555-0
01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:05.650
In 3D it is called the plane.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16565-0
01:15:05.660 --> 01:15:07.670
In higher dimension it is called
the hyperplane.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16576-0
01:15:08.170 --> 01:15:10.260
The intersection of two planes
is basic.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16581-0
01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:13.690
I got about one way, that's all
classes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16599-0
01:15:17.550 --> 01:15:20.413
Can you put your system on mute
in case you are not talking to

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16599-1
01:15:20.413 --> 01:15:20.550
me?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16659-0
01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:29.077
The intersection of two planes
is a line and in case you have

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16659-1
01:15:29.077 --> 01:15:33.876
three planes, they can also meet
at a point and so all the three

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16659-2
01:15:33.876 --> 01:15:38.601
constraints in higher dimension
can also meet in the same line,

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16659-3
01:15:38.601 --> 01:15:43.400
which can which will say that we
have infinitely many solutions.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16668-0
01:15:45.700 --> 01:15:47.570
Now here comes the main masala.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16686-0
01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:52.143
So this is all about how do we
characterize this solutions

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16686-1
01:15:52.143 --> 01:15:52.690
etcetera.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16741-0
01:15:52.700 --> 01:15:58.963
So we have a very simple example
of system of equations, so you

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16741-1
01:15:58.963 --> 01:16:05.226
feel if I read it correctly it
is X 1 + 8 X 3 -, 4 X 4 equal to

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16741-2
01:16:05.226 --> 01:16:10.120
42 and 0 X 1 + 1 X 2 + 2 X 3 + 2
LX 4 equal to 8.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16751-0
01:16:10.630 --> 01:16:12.260
So we are just given 2
equations.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16762-0
01:16:12.270 --> 01:16:15.650
We are asked to determine the
solutions of that now.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16773-0
01:16:16.350 --> 01:16:20.260
Uh, should I give you the the
the big picture first?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16782-0
01:16:24.250 --> 01:16:24.900
Yes, yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16778-0
01:16:24.270 --> 01:16:24.390
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16784-0
01:16:25.370 --> 01:16:25.860
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16788-0
01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:25.620
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16797-0
01:16:25.870 --> 01:16:28.650
So OK, so the big picture is as
follows.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16792-0
01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:26.280
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16806-0
01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:31.810
Uh, indeed.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16824-0
01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:35.213
In algebra, we don't, you know,
you are not satisfied as long as

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16824-1
01:16:35.213 --> 01:16:36.310
you get one solution.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16854-0
01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:40.279
We want to get a set of all
solutions, so how do we get all

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16854-1
01:16:40.279 --> 01:16:43.710
solutions so I will just give
you the plane ticket.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16870-0
01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:46.961
So you are given something like
a X equal to B and you're asked

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16870-1
01:16:46.961 --> 01:16:47.670
to solve this.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16881-0
01:16:49.540 --> 01:16:53.060
Now when solving for this, what
you do is basically.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16890-0
01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:58.990
You try to get one solution
somehow.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16906-0
01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:04.910
OK, so let's say my X equal to X
not is 1. Solution.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16923-0
01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:08.820
Well, nobody asked how this
somehow works.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16931-0
01:17:08.830 --> 01:17:13.120
Then now I'm going to concrete
taste this somehow.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16937-0
01:17:15.570 --> 01:17:15.960
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16964-0
01:17:15.970 --> 01:17:18.568
I will tell you a method by
which you can get it, but is it

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16964-1
01:17:18.568 --> 01:17:20.300
so suppose you get X equal to X
not as.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16976-0
01:17:20.310 --> 01:17:24.770
One solution is that all ohh so
the answer is no.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16997-0
01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:30.235
I will also try to solve the
system AXE equal to 0 and get

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/16997-1
01:17:30.235 --> 01:17:32.120
the solutions of this system.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17007-0
01:17:34.050 --> 01:17:35.470
This is what is given to me.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17012-0
01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:36.660
AX equal to B.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17020-0
01:17:36.730 --> 01:17:37.940
And I mean ask to solve.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17036-0
01:17:38.510 --> 01:17:42.576
Now you can ask me why am I
trying to solve this AX equal to

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17036-1
01:17:42.576 --> 01:17:42.710
0.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17045-0
01:17:43.710 --> 01:17:46.940
Please note if there is a
solution called X.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17059-0
01:17:48.670 --> 01:17:54.150
And X bar, which salts AXE equal
to 0.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17072-0
01:17:54.620 --> 01:17:56.740
Now what about X naughty plus X
bar?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17091-0
01:17:58.210 --> 01:18:02.437
If you are play a on that, this
is nothing but a X not plus AX

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17091-1
01:18:02.437 --> 01:18:03.310
bar, correct?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17102-0
01:18:07.340 --> 01:18:07.860
Yes, yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17103-0
01:18:08.230 --> 01:18:09.170
What is a X not?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17104-0
01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:09.320
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17126-0
01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:15.780
What is a X not ** not is 1
solution.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17121-0
01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:15.070
You know.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17123-0
01:18:15.370 --> 01:18:16.070
Do little.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17130-0
01:18:16.260 --> 01:18:17.350
BB.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17136-0
01:18:17.230 --> 01:18:19.950
He me plus ax bar.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17131-0
01:18:17.300 --> 01:18:17.550
Leader.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17135-0
01:18:17.700 --> 01:18:17.950
Me.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17140-0
01:18:22.090 --> 01:18:22.460
Ditto.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17146-0
01:18:24.210 --> 01:18:24.470
0.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17161-0
01:18:25.090 --> 01:18:28.930
So you see X naughty plus X bar
is also solution of ax equal to

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17161-1
01:18:28.930 --> 01:18:29.590
be correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17165-0
01:18:32.310 --> 01:18:32.570
Correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17167-0
01:18:33.100 --> 01:18:33.240
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17169-0
01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:34.800
Agree.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17207-0
01:18:36.380 --> 01:18:39.895
So what you're going to do is we
are trying to find one solution

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17207-1
01:18:39.895 --> 01:18:43.357
of a X equal to B and trying to
find out other solutions of a X

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17207-2
01:18:43.357 --> 01:18:44.980
equal to 0 and combining them.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17215-0
01:18:46.220 --> 01:18:48.210
Now, what is the meaning of
combining?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17236-0
01:18:48.420 --> 01:18:53.961
Suppose I write instead of this
a of X naughty plus some scalar

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17236-1
01:18:53.961 --> 01:18:55.000
times X bar.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17243-0
01:18:56.620 --> 01:18:58.010
Will it also solve my system?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17248-0
01:18:58.280 --> 01:18:58.950
Now, what is this?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17257-0
01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:00.830
This is a X naughty plus.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17280-0
01:19:01.220 --> 01:19:05.506
The K can be brought out a X bar
which is nothing but B + 0 which

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17265-0
01:19:01.850 --> 01:19:01.990
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17280-1
01:19:05.506 --> 01:19:07.000
is equal to B, correct?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17288-0
01:19:09.570 --> 01:19:10.170
Yes. Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17287-0
01:19:09.810 --> 01:19:10.090
Right.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17295-0
01:19:10.990 --> 01:19:13.080
So you find 1X bar.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17322-0
01:19:13.090 --> 01:19:16.409
You can multiply it with any
constant and add it to X naughty

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17322-1
01:19:16.409 --> 01:19:18.980
and it'll again solve your
system X equal to B.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17343-0
01:19:19.730 --> 01:19:22.848
Now that is what we are trying
to illustrate, but you are

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17343-1
01:19:22.848 --> 01:19:25.160
fundamental question as to how
this sound.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17349-0
01:19:25.170 --> 01:19:26.520
How is going to work?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17360-0
01:19:26.590 --> 01:19:28.900
I'm going to formalize it by
giving you a method.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17362-0
01:19:29.030 --> 01:19:29.540
Agree.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17386-0
01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:33.162
So for the time being, you
assume that you have a method by

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17386-1
01:19:33.162 --> 01:19:35.050
which you can solve a equal to
B.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17412-0
01:19:36.630 --> 01:19:43.153
OK, so if I Simply put X1 equal
to 42 and X2 equal to 8, does it

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17412-1
01:19:43.153 --> 01:19:44.860
solve X3X4 zeros?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17419-0
01:19:51.230 --> 01:19:51.790
Does it solve?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17417-0
01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:51.480
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17431-0
01:19:54.140 --> 01:19:54.620
Can you repeat?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17455-0
01:19:54.530 --> 01:19:59.792
If it if I put X1 equal to 42
and X2 equal to 8X3 and X4 are

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17444-0
01:19:57.080 --> 01:19:57.270
No.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17455-1
01:19:59.792 --> 01:20:00.310
zeros.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17463-0
01:20:00.990 --> 01:20:02.300
No, no, wait.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17481-0
01:20:02.710 --> 01:20:03.630
No, no.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17482-0
01:20:03.610 --> 01:20:05.730
Yes, of course.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17479-0
01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:04.120
Wait.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17474-0
01:20:03.940 --> 01:20:04.400
No, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17483-0
01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:06.650
Didn't wanna do it.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17484-0
01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:06.680
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17497-0
01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:10.160
Yes it will.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17493-0
01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:10.470
So can you.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17502-0
01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:12.350
Can you repeat the and?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17506-0
01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:14.480
The last examples are.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17516-0
01:20:14.820 --> 01:20:16.840
I'm not really following that
one.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17524-0
01:20:17.830 --> 01:20:21.590
Uh, and that X bar and
everything.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17520-0
01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:18.590
Which one ma?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17534-0
01:20:21.470 --> 01:20:22.460
Ah, that one.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17542-0
01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:23.640
What you did last time, yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17552-0
01:20:23.270 --> 01:20:28.280
OK, So what I'm saying is I have
one solution AX not equal to B.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17567-0
01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:33.920
OK, I have one solution from.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17563-0
01:20:32.020 --> 01:20:32.280
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17571-0
01:20:33.930 --> 01:20:35.260
Somehow I got the solution.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17591-0
01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:40.367
It's not equal to B, so in this
case can I explain the with with

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17591-1
01:20:40.367 --> 01:20:41.610
my example here?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17597-0
01:20:43.890 --> 01:20:44.580
Yes, sure.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17605-0
01:20:44.780 --> 01:20:47.990
OK so here I get this system.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17621-0
01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:51.800
I'm just putting X1 equal to 42
X 2 equal to 8.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17628-0
01:20:51.810 --> 01:20:53.040
The other two are zeros.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17629-0
01:20:52.980 --> 01:20:53.270
Thank.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17637-0
01:20:55.550 --> 01:20:56.730
Are you getting the right and
say?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17643-0
01:20:59.000 --> 01:20:59.120
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17644-0
01:20:59.530 --> 01:20:59.630
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17649-0
01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:01.020
Yes, yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17663-0
01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:03.230
Yes, so it is simply by
inspection.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17660-0
01:21:01.570 --> 01:21:01.690
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17656-0
01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:01.870
Correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17676-0
01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:06.450
I have got 42800 solution
correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17669-0
01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:03.480
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17675-0
01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:05.640
Yeah, session.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17680-0
01:21:07.990 --> 01:21:08.310
Correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17691-0
01:21:09.150 --> 01:21:13.660
OK, now the question is, is it
all or?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17695-0
01:21:13.670 --> 01:21:15.800
There are other solutions now.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17718-0
01:21:15.810 --> 01:21:20.998
The answer is I can also find
out this into X1 X 2X3 equal to

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17718-1
01:21:20.998 --> 01:21:23.090
0 and solve that correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17736-0
01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:31.480
They tell me many solutions,
yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17751-0
01:21:32.180 --> 01:21:40.116
That's what I'm also trying to
say, so I got 42800 as X not

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17751-1
01:21:40.116 --> 01:21:40.910
agree.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17763-0
01:21:42.890 --> 01:21:43.230
Correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17762-0
01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:43.040
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17777-0
01:21:43.990 --> 01:21:48.520
Now I'm trying to solve a X
equal to 00 is a vector 0.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17784-0
01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:51.530
Now let me try do that.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17791-0
01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:52.990
Do you remember the elements of
the matrix?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17798-0
01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:56.090
Yeah, it exit.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17807-0
01:21:57.170 --> 01:21:57.490
They're not.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17826-0
01:21:57.250 --> 01:22:02.820
108 minus 401212 X 1X2 X 3X4.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17810-0
01:21:57.850 --> 01:21:58.290
10.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17822-0
01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:01.080
Then.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17833-0
01:22:02.830 --> 01:22:04.280
It should be equal to 00.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17843-0
01:22:04.870 --> 01:22:06.620
I will try to solve that now.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17884-0
01:22:07.990 --> 01:22:13.513
If I try to solve it I will see
OK, this is something you know

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17884-1
01:22:13.513 --> 01:22:18.247
what I will do is I will
describe the four problems I

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17884-2
01:22:18.247 --> 01:22:22.280
have C1C2C3C4 should I write
this thing down?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17894-0
01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:25.500
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17891-0
01:22:26.300 --> 01:22:26.590
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17906-0
01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:29.310
So can you take a screenshot and
tell me help me with this matrix

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17906-1
01:22:29.310 --> 01:22:29.680
elements.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17912-0
01:22:32.430 --> 01:22:33.680
108 minus 4.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17922-0
01:22:37.910 --> 01:22:38.960
This is 01.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17939-0
01:22:38.780 --> 01:22:43.400
012122 twelve.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17933-0
01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:42.010
On 12.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17928-0
01:22:40.170 --> 01:22:40.350
What?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17956-0
01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:50.200
Thread OK, now I'm trying to
solve X1 X 2X3X4 equal to.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17959-0
01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:51.490
For me that.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17961-0
01:22:52.930 --> 01:22:53.710
Deals you correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17964-0
01:22:56.790 --> 01:22:57.080
Correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17973-0
01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:01.270
Then they can combine these two
solutions.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17982-0
01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:02.790
So I am trying to solve this.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17986-0
01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:02.780
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/17991-0
01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:05.470
So how do I actually solve this?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18002-0
01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:08.390
I will say this is my column C1.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18009-0
01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:10.390
This is my column C2.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18038-0
01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:15.468
This is my column C3 and this is
my column C4 and somehow find

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18038-1
01:23:15.468 --> 01:23:19.280
some combination of this which
is give me 0 right.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18068-0
01:23:22.950 --> 01:23:25.060
Right, right. Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18059-0
01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:23.900
Said equal.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18053-0
01:23:23.150 --> 01:23:23.350
Like.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18071-0
01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:25.830
Now it is 42, eight right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18065-0
01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:24.400
Right.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18067-0
01:23:24.230 --> 01:23:24.660
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18084-0
01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:28.080
It's we.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18089-0
01:23:27.010 --> 01:23:28.810
No, but we are solving for X0.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18083-0
01:23:27.340 --> 01:23:27.500
What?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18116-0
01:23:29.310 --> 01:23:29.550
You know.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18094-0
01:23:29.620 --> 01:23:30.570
X equal to zero.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18101-0
01:23:30.020 --> 01:23:30.320
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18109-0
01:23:30.580 --> 01:23:32.480
I'm trying to solve not 42
eight.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18106-0
01:23:32.060 --> 01:23:32.660
OK, good.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18113-0
01:23:33.450 --> 01:23:34.090
OK, got it.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18117-0
01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:38.330
So you can observe that.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18149-0
01:23:40.700 --> 01:23:48.746
It's here that you will find 28
C 1 + 2 C 2 -, C, Three plus 0C4

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18149-1
01:23:48.746 --> 01:23:50.480
is equal to 0.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18156-0
01:23:50.910 --> 01:23:55.040
So for example, eight 2 -, 1,
zero.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18166-0
01:23:58.900 --> 01:24:01.250
Eight 2 -, 1, zero.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18176-0
01:24:01.260 --> 01:24:04.200
If you multiply the first one by
eight, what do you get?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18194-0
01:24:07.630 --> 01:24:09.290
70 yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18188-0
01:24:07.690 --> 01:24:07.920
Correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18193-0
01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:09.220
80.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18198-0
01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:11.290
This is 02.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18213-0
01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:16.230
This is a -, 1, so this is minus
8 -, 2, zero, zero.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18223-0
01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:18.080
If you Add all these things,
what do you get?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18230-0
01:24:19.810 --> 01:24:20.070
0.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18231-0
01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:20.520
0.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18232-0
01:24:21.090 --> 01:24:21.540
Pedro.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18241-0
01:24:23.420 --> 01:24:25.230
So 8 * C one.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18252-0
01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:30.080
So this eight, 2 -, 1, zero is 1
solution, right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18262-0
01:24:31.010 --> 01:24:34.170
Here's a solution of X equal to
0, correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18270-0
01:24:36.420 --> 01:24:36.650
Like.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18271-0
01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:37.120
His son.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18276-0
01:24:37.250 --> 01:24:37.520
But I.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18297-0
01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:43.210
So I've got one solution of a 2
-, 1, zero for a X equal to 0.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18304-0
01:24:43.220 --> 01:24:44.570
But is that the only solution?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18315-0
01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:46.680
I think I can find other things
also right.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18324-0
01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:50.170
I can find other things and.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18360-0
01:24:49.430 --> 01:24:49.970
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18350-0
01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:54.915
We can simply make 0 the second
vector and then that will also

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18350-1
01:24:54.915 --> 01:24:55.930
be one solution.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18343-0
01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:56.070
No, you cannot.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18347-0
01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:57.010
Not everything.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18373-0
01:24:57.020 --> 01:25:02.630
So there is a -, 4, C 1 + 12 C 2
+ 0 C 3 -, 1, C, 4 equal to 0.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18387-0
01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:07.060
So there is a -, 412, zero minus
one.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18393-0
01:25:07.070 --> 01:25:08.540
This is also a solution correct?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18399-0
01:25:11.870 --> 01:25:12.370
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18403-0
01:25:11.910 --> 01:25:13.300
Right, minus.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18410-0
01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:13.650
Yes, yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18409-0
01:25:12.890 --> 01:25:13.210
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18411-0
01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:13.610
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18406-0
01:25:13.390 --> 01:25:13.690
4.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18424-0
01:25:14.690 --> 01:25:19.260
OK, plus 0 + 0 -, 4 + 40.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18438-0
01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:22.740
This is 0, so this is also one
solution of a X equal to 0.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18499-0
01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:27.239
So what we do is we say 42800
plus Lambda one where Lambda is

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18499-1
01:25:27.239 --> 01:25:31.655
the any constant times eight 2
-, 1, zero plus Lambda 2 * -,

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18499-2
01:25:31.655 --> 01:25:36.072
412, zero minus one is going to
be a solution of this system

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18499-3
01:25:36.072 --> 01:25:39.330
where Lambda one and Lambda 2
are constants.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18507-0
01:25:40.290 --> 01:25:42.260
You keep changing Lambda 1
Lambda 2.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18515-0
01:25:42.270 --> 01:25:44.450
You will get infinitely many
solutions, agree.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18524-0
01:25:46.750 --> 01:25:46.870
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18528-0
01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:47.940
People, it's.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18522-0
01:25:46.870 --> 01:25:47.260
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18525-0
01:25:47.470 --> 01:25:47.620
This.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18531-0
01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:48.440
Yep.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18541-0
01:25:48.980 --> 01:25:52.979
Now neither the particular nor
the general solutions are

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18541-1
01:25:52.979 --> 01:25:53.470
unique.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18548-0
01:25:53.540 --> 01:25:55.140
Why it is not unique?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18550-0
01:25:56.500 --> 01:25:56.940
Any idea?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18561-0
01:26:04.870 --> 01:26:06.820
The particular the the general
solution.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18567-0
01:26:12.370 --> 01:26:13.700
This is not unique.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18581-0
01:26:13.710 --> 01:26:16.839
You agree with me because you
can multiply each of them with

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18581-1
01:26:16.839 --> 01:26:17.250
the any.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18592-0
01:26:19.350 --> 01:26:21.080
With any of the constants.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18600-0
01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:24.300
So instead of a two you can say
80.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18602-0
01:26:26.300 --> 01:26:26.660
20.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18611-0
01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:30.330
Minus 10 and 0.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18621-0
01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:32.920
This will also be a solution you
agree with me.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18629-0
01:26:33.830 --> 01:26:36.190
You multiply each of them with
UH-10.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18637-0
01:26:37.770 --> 01:26:37.970
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18646-0
01:26:38.250 --> 01:26:38.850
This is yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18655-0
01:26:38.900 --> 01:26:40.870
Correct, yes. Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18648-0
01:26:39.110 --> 01:26:39.370
Like.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18683-0
01:26:39.620 --> 01:26:42.777
Similarly, you can multiply each
of them with minus five or minus

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18683-1
01:26:42.777 --> 01:26:45.647
10, whatever it is with the next
number and it log in based

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18683-2
01:26:45.647 --> 01:26:47.130
solution so that is not unique.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18685-0
01:26:46.810 --> 01:26:47.010
Right.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18700-0
01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:50.657
Since you're adding these two,
you don't get uniqueness in this

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18700-1
01:26:50.657 --> 01:26:51.070
solution.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18713-0
01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:54.430
You have infinitely many
possibilities. Agree.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18718-0
01:26:54.900 --> 01:26:55.850
So that I have one question.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18717-0
01:26:55.780 --> 01:26:55.900
But.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18724-0
01:26:56.350 --> 01:26:56.510
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18743-0
01:26:58.010 --> 01:27:02.645
Can you go back to the previous
the where you're taking notes,

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18740-0
01:26:58.040 --> 01:26:58.590
And even the.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18743-1
01:27:02.645 --> 01:27:02.940
Sir?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18752-0
01:27:03.580 --> 01:27:04.040
Yeah, sure.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18747-0
01:27:05.100 --> 01:27:05.410
Uh.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18749-0
01:27:05.420 --> 01:27:05.650
Why?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18763-0
01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:08.060
Why did we add up the numbers in
the matrix?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18765-0
01:27:09.390 --> 01:27:09.740
Uh.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18771-0
01:27:09.820 --> 01:27:10.850
You you mean here?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18775-0
01:27:11.830 --> 01:27:12.090
Right.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18784-0
01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:15.830
Ah, because I am saying 98C1.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18797-0
01:27:17.830 --> 01:27:23.640
And +2 C 2 -, C, Three plus 0C4.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18810-0
01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:28.280
Now see when is the first column
right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18820-0
01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:30.380
Right.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18828-0
01:27:31.140 --> 01:27:34.200
So this is the AC1 is basically
the but 80 correct?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18836-0
01:27:36.030 --> 01:27:37.580
Plus 2C2.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18844-0
01:27:37.670 --> 01:27:39.180
This is 2 * 0 one.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18846-0
01:27:39.290 --> 01:27:40.520
This is 02, correct?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18863-0
01:27:44.610 --> 01:27:46.220
OK, OK, I'm getting now, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18865-0
01:27:45.050 --> 01:27:45.560
It would be.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18866-0
01:27:46.290 --> 01:27:46.520
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18861-0
01:27:46.350 --> 01:27:47.020
OK, fine.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18871-0
01:27:47.070 --> 01:27:47.980
OK, fine.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18879-0
01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:48.060
Thank you.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18886-0
01:27:48.450 --> 01:27:49.960
So that is the reason why we are
doing this.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18904-0
01:27:50.740 --> 01:27:54.738
For more questions, how did you
arrive at eight 2 -, 1, zero as

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18897-0
01:27:51.850 --> 01:27:52.280
Yeah, please.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18904-1
01:27:54.738 --> 01:27:55.550
the solution?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18911-0
01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:56.040
First of all.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18915-0
01:27:57.200 --> 01:27:58.180
Eight 2 -, 1, zero.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18924-0
01:27:59.550 --> 01:28:01.300
Uh, how did you arrive at this
number?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18930-0
01:28:01.310 --> 01:28:02.550
Right, 2 -, 1, zero.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18959-0
01:28:04.410 --> 01:28:07.088
Oh, this is by inspection, but
I'm going to tell you a method

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18959-1
01:28:07.088 --> 01:28:08.600
by which I'm going to get it
done.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18989-0
01:28:10.250 --> 01:28:14.494
And how are we sure that they
there are only two sets of see

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18989-1
01:28:14.494 --> 01:28:17.000
like constants which have
solution?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18990-0
01:28:15.210 --> 01:28:18.790
Ah, they they very, very good
question.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/18998-0
01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:21.820
So there are there are.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19014-0
01:28:23.420 --> 01:28:26.250
Multiple solutions to this I
will I will tell you this.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19020-0
01:28:26.420 --> 01:28:27.990
You give me some 2-3 minutes,
OK?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19029-0
01:28:30.650 --> 01:28:30.920
Sure.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19041-0
01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:35.010
So one question is, how did I
arrive at 42800?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19082-0
01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:39.260
Second question is how the hell
I got 8/2 minus and zero or

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19082-1
01:28:39.260 --> 01:28:43.333
minus 41201 or minus one and
whether I'm lucky because it's a

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19082-2
01:28:43.333 --> 01:28:46.420
smaller system that I could get
these numbers.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19124-0
01:28:46.470 --> 01:28:50.000
Or is there a systematic
approach to get this and how do

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19124-1
01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:53.778
you know that there are only two
Lambda 1 Lambda 2 which are

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19124-2
01:28:53.778 --> 01:28:57.680
supporting these vectors and why
not there is a third one now?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19129-0
01:28:57.690 --> 01:28:58.940
These are the questions you
have.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19143-0
01:28:59.020 --> 01:29:01.470
These are very legitimate
questions, Sir. Now.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19162-0
01:29:02.060 --> 01:29:08.584
So I have another question in
that the .1 is there a proof

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19150-0
01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:03.940
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19162-1
01:29:08.584 --> 01:29:09.580
like you?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19185-0
01:29:09.620 --> 01:29:13.545
Let us assume that we have all
these solutions for X equal to 0

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19187-0
01:29:13.340 --> 01:29:13.520
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19185-1
01:29:13.545 --> 01:29:14.650
and we generalize.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19213-0
01:29:14.730 --> 01:29:18.074
Are they all the solutions or
can there be any other solution

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19213-1
01:29:18.074 --> 01:29:20.070
which is not, you know X equal
to 0?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19217-0
01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:20.690
Some other thing.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19236-0
01:29:21.750 --> 01:29:23.740
Is there proof I mean theorem?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19226-0
01:29:23.340 --> 01:29:23.730
No, no.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19228-0
01:29:23.740 --> 01:29:24.180
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19249-0
01:29:24.260 --> 01:29:26.750
No, no, you find the solutions
of a X equal to 0.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19276-0
01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:27.960
Ohh.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19269-0
01:29:28.180 --> 01:29:31.636
Those solutions can be added to
a X equal to B and that will

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19269-1
01:29:31.636 --> 01:29:32.770
still be a solution.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19282-0
01:29:32.820 --> 01:29:33.790
That's what is my claim.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19309-0
01:29:34.300 --> 01:29:39.716
So I'm I'm asking is that all
solutions or is there a proof

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19295-0
01:29:37.410 --> 01:29:38.580
Yeah, it is hard solutions.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19309-1
01:29:39.716 --> 01:29:40.980
for that like?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19307-0
01:29:41.140 --> 01:29:41.980
Yeah, there is a proof.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19311-0
01:29:41.990 --> 01:29:42.520
There is a proof.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19312-0
01:29:43.420 --> 01:29:43.720
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19330-0
01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:49.562
Now the question is, uh, I will
directly get into something

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19330-1
01:29:49.562 --> 01:29:51.150
called Gaussian elimination.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19364-0
01:29:51.340 --> 01:29:55.072
Now, what is Gaussian
elimination is to used to reduce

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19364-1
01:29:55.072 --> 01:29:59.144
a matrix to an upper triangular
form so that you can easily

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19364-2
01:29:59.144 --> 01:30:01.180
solve the system of equations.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19375-0
01:30:02.930 --> 01:30:06.120
Now I will give you a small
example.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19391-0
01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:09.110
Now this is what I called as an
elementary operations.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19403-0
01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:10.670
What can you do in elementary
operation?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19405-0
01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:11.670
Can exchange rows.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19418-0
01:30:12.280 --> 01:30:15.620
You can multiply row by a
constant which is non zero.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19431-0
01:30:16.040 --> 01:30:19.080
You can add one row to another
row.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19446-0
01:30:17.110 --> 01:30:17.280
I.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19439-0
01:30:20.430 --> 01:30:23.400
Now, these are all legitimate
operations.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19458-0
01:30:23.830 --> 01:30:27.432
Now there is a question why you
must any multiplayer to a Roby

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19458-1
01:30:27.432 --> 01:30:27.890
nonzero?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19460-0
01:30:27.900 --> 01:30:28.900
Anybody has an answer?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19511-0
01:30:33.250 --> 01:30:37.154
If you multiply, yeah, I mean 10
it will not add any value to

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19505-0
01:30:33.390 --> 01:30:35.650
Because if we multiply by zero,
it becomes 0.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19498-0
01:30:33.430 --> 01:30:34.690
Otherwise it becomes 0.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19507-0
01:30:35.150 --> 01:30:36.210
To make this thing here.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19511-1
01:30:37.154 --> 01:30:37.910
your system.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19530-0
01:30:39.220 --> 01:30:42.344
So I'm going to give us very
small example to tell you what

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19530-1
01:30:42.344 --> 01:30:44.010
happens in these kind of things.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19538-0
01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:45.610
So you have you see a system,
right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19562-0
01:30:49.590 --> 01:30:51.100
Yes, yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19543-0
01:30:50.350 --> 01:30:50.700
You are.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19547-0
01:30:50.740 --> 01:30:51.050
You are.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19549-0
01:30:51.060 --> 01:30:51.380
See.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19569-0
01:30:51.390 --> 01:30:54.250
Uh, you are seeing the system
now.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19568-0
01:30:51.690 --> 01:30:52.640
I get it done.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19591-0
01:30:54.300 --> 01:30:56.682
We want to solve this system,
but we want to have a very

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19591-1
01:30:56.682 --> 01:30:58.940
systematic procedure of solving
things in the system.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19597-0
01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:00.280
So what do we do?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19610-0
01:31:00.290 --> 01:31:01.800
Is we write it in the matrix
form.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19631-0
01:31:01.870 --> 01:31:06.458
So if you write it in the matrix
form, it becomes very simple and

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19631-1
01:31:06.458 --> 01:31:09.170
this is how the matrix will look
like.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19643-0
01:31:09.260 --> 01:31:12.820
So these are the the elements of
the coefficient matrix.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19657-0
01:31:12.830 --> 01:31:15.583
These are the elements in the
right hand side, so you write it

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19657-1
01:31:15.583 --> 01:31:16.020
like this.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19673-0
01:31:18.210 --> 01:31:21.070
Now what you do is the first
stage you try to eat.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19674-0
01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:22.200
OK, better.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19689-0
01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:26.910
What's happening I?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19695-0
01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:29.640
Hey, can you put your systems on
mute please?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19699-0
01:31:32.260 --> 01:31:33.010
Thanks.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19720-0
01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:36.790
So the point is, you know, try
to interchange the 3rd row and

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19720-1
01:31:36.790 --> 01:31:37.610
the first row.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19735-0
01:31:38.700 --> 01:31:42.574
If you change the interchange,
the third one first row you will

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19735-1
01:31:42.574 --> 01:31:44.390
get something like this agree.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19742-0
01:31:47.640 --> 01:31:47.880
Yep.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19753-0
01:31:48.070 --> 01:31:48.790
Yes, yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19758-0
01:31:48.110 --> 01:31:49.380
Yes, yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19747-0
01:31:49.170 --> 01:31:49.620
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19757-0
01:31:49.220 --> 01:31:49.380
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19751-0
01:31:49.630 --> 01:31:50.300
You believe me?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19760-0
01:31:50.310 --> 01:31:50.760
I am.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19765-0
01:31:50.830 --> 01:31:52.420
I have checked this
calculations.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19785-0
01:31:52.890 --> 01:31:56.888
Now what you do is you try to
make this 40 by using elementary

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19785-1
01:31:56.888 --> 01:31:57.840
row operations.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19802-0
01:31:57.850 --> 01:32:02.330
So what is it mean is you
subtract from this four times

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19802-1
01:32:02.330 --> 01:32:03.450
the first row.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19824-0
01:32:05.730 --> 01:32:09.553
You subtract from the 2nd row
four times the first row, so you

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19824-1
01:32:09.553 --> 01:32:11.010
really not get a 0 here.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19833-0
01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:12.480
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19850-0
01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:14.660
And when they leave it?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19841-0
01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:14.950
You get some number here.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19848-0
01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:15.760
You get some number.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19888-0
01:32:15.770 --> 01:32:19.612
You get all these numbers are
changed similarly this minus two

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19877-0
01:32:17.410 --> 01:32:20.520
You know it is working.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19888-1
01:32:19.612 --> 01:32:23.150
to make it 0 you add two times
the first row to this row.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19895-0
01:32:23.090 --> 01:32:23.760
What is your father?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19897-0
01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:24.700
That's make this number 0,
right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19898-0
01:32:23.850 --> 01:32:24.720
And then?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19921-0
01:32:28.930 --> 01:32:32.518
One question here, can we add a
you know a row one and row four,

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19920-0
01:32:31.330 --> 01:32:31.610
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19921-1
01:32:32.518 --> 01:32:33.070
row three?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19930-0
01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:34.410
That will also make it 0, right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19934-0
01:32:34.890 --> 01:32:35.510
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19968-0
01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:40.461
Perfect, but the but the point
is I want to make all these

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19953-0
01:32:37.430 --> 01:32:38.320
You can't leave me, OK?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19968-1
01:32:40.461 --> 01:32:43.700
elements and three elements to
be zeros.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19976-0
01:32:44.100 --> 01:32:45.650
I want these three elements to
be zeros.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20011-0
01:32:49.330 --> 01:32:53.810
I will tell you the reason why I
will tell you recently what.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20010-0
01:32:49.700 --> 01:32:53.040
That that means that the let's
get better than.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/19999-0
01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:50.360
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20009-0
01:32:52.230 --> 01:32:52.520
Ohh.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20015-0
01:32:55.460 --> 01:32:55.970
Slash.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20031-0
01:33:00.140 --> 01:33:03.070
Uh, so is it like the lower
triangle matrix?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20043-0
01:33:03.140 --> 01:33:04.420
Uh, we need to design.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20058-0
01:33:03.330 --> 01:33:08.476
The upper triangular man, it is
upper triangular, so I want to

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20052-0
01:33:06.420 --> 01:33:06.680
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20058-1
01:33:08.476 --> 01:33:09.620
make these 30.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20080-0
01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:13.372
So one way of doing it is you
from 4 you subtract 4 times the

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20080-1
01:33:13.372 --> 01:33:14.980
first row that will become.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20094-0
01:33:14.990 --> 01:33:18.200
This element will become 0 -, 2,
add two times this row.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20109-0
01:33:18.210 --> 01:33:21.437
It will become zero from one you
add you subtract minus one

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20109-1
01:33:21.437 --> 01:33:21.760
times.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20123-0
01:33:21.770 --> 01:33:25.073
This you will become zero if you
do that you will get something

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20123-1
01:33:25.073 --> 01:33:25.590
like this.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20130-0
01:33:27.890 --> 01:33:28.190
Agree.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20146-0
01:33:29.470 --> 01:33:32.585
Uh, Sir, we could have done this
without swapping one and three.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20145-0
01:33:31.310 --> 01:33:31.420
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20146-1
01:33:32.585 --> 01:33:33.160
Also, right.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20148-0
01:33:33.230 --> 01:33:33.460
Why?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20157-0
01:33:33.470 --> 01:33:34.560
Why did we have to swap?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20166-0
01:33:36.020 --> 01:33:37.140
People have done it without.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20168-0
01:33:37.900 --> 01:33:38.950
Swapping uh.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20181-0
01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:40.000
Row one and row 3.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20184-0
01:33:40.470 --> 01:33:41.500
Yeah, you can.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20205-0
01:33:41.510 --> 01:33:45.242
You can do it, but that'll get
into murky decimals for for to

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20205-1
01:33:45.242 --> 01:33:47.650
put it in a slide, it become
difficult.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20209-0
01:33:50.340 --> 01:33:50.570
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20210-0
01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:51.100
Agree.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20218-0
01:33:53.250 --> 01:33:53.560
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20232-0
01:33:55.100 --> 01:33:57.630
But there is nothing wrong in
doing that also OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20258-0
01:33:57.750 --> 01:34:03.287
So just one question, why a is
there as the last element in the

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20252-0
01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:04.470
Yeah, the the.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20258-1
01:34:03.287 --> 01:34:03.980
metrics?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20263-0
01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:06.110
No, that is what it is now.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20271-0
01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:08.290
So that YA will give you some
idea.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20284-0
01:34:08.300 --> 01:34:09.960
So I'm going to talk about that
a now.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20287-0
01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:11.070
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20318-0
01:34:11.430 --> 01:34:16.290
You keep doing this operations
and then you will be able to get

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20318-1
01:34:16.290 --> 01:34:20.771
those uh things right now when
you subtract from this, you

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20318-2
01:34:20.771 --> 01:34:23.050
subtract this, you get a zero.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20328-0
01:34:23.260 --> 01:34:25.020
When you do this, you'll get
some number.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20344-0
01:34:25.030 --> 01:34:29.150
You'll get to get some, but for
a a -, 0 will be a only, right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20352-0
01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:34.510
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20358-0
01:34:34.940 --> 01:34:35.220
Enter.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20353-0
01:34:35.020 --> 01:34:35.790
OK, fine.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20361-0
01:34:36.220 --> 01:34:37.610
So you get this thing.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20374-0
01:34:37.620 --> 01:34:41.110
Now the question is you get
these three elements zeros.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20386-0
01:34:41.420 --> 01:34:47.410
Now the the idea is to have this
element is 0 agree.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20392-0
01:34:47.900 --> 01:34:49.970
Now, how do you make this
element 0?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20413-0
01:34:50.060 --> 01:34:53.954
You can either subtract it and
then you will get something

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20413-1
01:34:53.954 --> 01:34:56.330
where this element has become
zero.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20432-0
01:34:56.340 --> 01:35:01.760
You get a -, 360, you get 00000
and the A + 1.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20452-0
01:35:03.730 --> 01:35:08.192
Now imagine that your system of
equations is now reduced to

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20452-1
01:35:08.192 --> 01:35:09.680
something like this.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20477-0
01:35:09.690 --> 01:35:13.089
This is now upper triangular
sort of and then you are getting

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20477-1
01:35:13.089 --> 01:35:14.570
the last row full of zeros.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20516-0
01:35:15.130 --> 01:35:19.190
Now, if I interpret the last
row, it is something like 0X1

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20516-1
01:35:19.190 --> 01:35:23.389
plus 0X2 plus 0X3 plus 0X4 plus
0X5 which is equal to a + 1,

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20516-2
01:35:23.389 --> 01:35:23.940
correct?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20522-0
01:35:27.020 --> 01:35:27.160
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20543-0
01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:32.310
But what is 0 X 1 + 0 X 2 + 0 X
3 + 0 X 4 + 0 X 5?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20554-0
01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:33.040
This is 0 right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20561-0
01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:35.100
General education minus one.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20564-0
01:35:34.530 --> 01:35:37.220
But zero is equal to a + 1.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20593-0
01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:40.816
Will simply tell you saying that
if a is a number other than

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20593-1
01:35:40.816 --> 01:35:43.850
minus one, this is not going to
have any solution correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20604-0
01:35:45.340 --> 01:35:46.080
But just.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20603-0
01:35:45.930 --> 01:35:46.090
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20602-0
01:35:45.970 --> 01:35:46.150
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20608-0
01:35:46.150 --> 01:35:47.230
Let's say A is fine.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20629-0
01:35:48.250 --> 01:35:52.860
Can 0X1 plus zero X 2 + 0 X 0 +
0 X 4 + 0 X 5B equal to six?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20634-0
01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:54.860
He can never be right.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20638-0
01:35:57.500 --> 01:35:57.640
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20643-0
01:35:57.950 --> 01:35:58.120
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20651-0
01:35:58.370 --> 01:35:59.030
Never mind. Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20658-0
01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:02.190
So this A is supposed to be
minus one agreed.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20659-0
01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:03.710
Correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20672-0
01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:04.780
Yeah, Mr minus one.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20674-0
01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:06.690
It must be minus one then.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20679-0
01:36:06.860 --> 01:36:07.630
OK, fine.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20687-0
01:36:08.020 --> 01:36:11.270
Now I will also have some
observation.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20720-0
01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:15.661
If you take the first two column
element and the second column

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20720-1
01:36:15.661 --> 01:36:19.137
element, the second column
element can be got from the

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20720-2
01:36:19.137 --> 01:36:22.234
first column element by
multiplying the minus 2,

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20720-3
01:36:22.234 --> 01:36:22.740
correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20725-0
01:36:24.910 --> 01:36:25.130
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20730-0
01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:25.920
Yes, yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20741-0
01:36:26.090 --> 01:36:27.290
OK, it's.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20740-0
01:36:26.790 --> 01:36:27.350
So yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20749-0
01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:30.670
Similarly, you take the 4th
column and 5th column.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20764-0
01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:34.644
If you multiply the 4th column
by -, 1, you get the 5th column,

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20764-1
01:36:34.644 --> 01:36:35.060
correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20773-0
01:36:37.660 --> 01:36:37.780
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20787-0
01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:41.050
I come on, think about it. You
cannot.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20779-0
01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:39.590
That is correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20791-0
01:36:39.990 --> 01:36:40.090
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20801-0
01:36:40.630 --> 01:36:41.930
No, no, no, no.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20817-0
01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:41.930
You cannot.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20794-0
01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:42.490
You cannot.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20799-0
01:36:42.500 --> 01:36:42.950
You cannot.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20809-0
01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:43.250
You can.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20839-0
01:36:43.010 --> 01:36:45.730
Ah, don't bluntly believe my
statements.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20822-0
01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:44.540
No, no, no, no.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20825-0
01:36:43.330 --> 01:36:43.930
No, we can't.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20835-0
01:36:43.410 --> 01:36:44.270
We cannot get in.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20842-0
01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:46.650
No. Mm-hmm.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20841-0
01:36:44.810 --> 01:36:46.430
Because no Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20866-0
01:36:46.770 --> 01:36:51.549
Ah, so the the 4th column and
5th column are two different

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20866-1
01:36:51.549 --> 01:36:54.790
things, but I have a small trick
there.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20876-0
01:36:55.280 --> 01:36:59.910
You try to divide the third
column by yet three.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20880-0
01:37:00.220 --> 01:37:00.760
What do you get?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20912-0
01:37:06.580 --> 01:37:08.720
If you divide the third, sorry.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20921-0
01:37:07.050 --> 01:37:07.850
One with you.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20915-0
01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:09.080
Minus one and minus one, but we.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20941-0
01:37:07.810 --> 01:37:09.030
Minus 192.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20928-0
01:37:08.730 --> 01:37:09.810
Sorry if you sorry, sorry.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20947-0
01:37:09.180 --> 01:37:10.390
One one with three months.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20949-0
01:37:09.490 --> 01:37:11.030
Management tool will come there,
yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20977-0
01:37:09.820 --> 01:37:15.293
Sorry if you divide the 3rd row
by three or a -, 3 you will get

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20977-1
01:37:15.293 --> 01:37:18.800
it minus one and a 2 and a -, 1
correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20972-0
01:37:17.130 --> 01:37:17.490
A2.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20974-0
01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:18.140
Don't.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20985-0
01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:19.990
Two, yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20982-0
01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:19.580
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20978-0
01:37:19.570 --> 01:37:19.710
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20986-0
01:37:20.490 --> 01:37:21.360
OK, fine.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/20990-0
01:37:21.450 --> 01:37:22.520
So keep it in mind.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21007-0
01:37:22.890 --> 01:37:26.565
Now what happens is this is now
going to be something called row

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21007-1
01:37:26.565 --> 01:37:27.300
echelon form.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21021-0
01:37:27.310 --> 01:37:29.190
So I will just revise what is
row echelon form.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21034-0
01:37:30.060 --> 01:37:36.952
Roy Khilan form is something
where you start taking the rows

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21034-1
01:37:36.952 --> 01:37:37.630
first.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21040-0
01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:39.170
You start with row number one.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21058-0
01:37:39.580 --> 01:37:44.406
OK, you try to find out where
you find the first nonzero

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21058-1
01:37:44.406 --> 01:37:45.930
element in row #1.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21073-0
01:37:45.980 --> 01:37:48.080
What is the first nonzero
element in row #1?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21085-0
01:37:49.100 --> 01:37:50.510
But one.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21078-0
01:37:49.330 --> 01:37:49.570
1st.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21087-0
01:37:49.530 --> 01:37:50.650
When bun?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21092-0
01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:51.470
Even your phone.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21093-0
01:37:51.180 --> 01:37:51.710
Perfect.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21095-0
01:37:51.470 --> 01:37:51.690
1.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21104-0
01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:55.250
OK, now you come to row #2.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21114-0
01:37:55.380 --> 01:37:57.390
Where do you first find the
nonzero element?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21131-0
01:37:58.270 --> 01:37:59.310
Minus 1 minus.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21138-0
01:37:58.520 --> 01:37:59.230
Minus one.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21128-0
01:37:58.630 --> 01:37:59.430
Minus 1 minus.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21119-0
01:37:58.660 --> 01:37:58.860
My.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21125-0
01:37:58.960 --> 01:37:59.020
As.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21134-0
01:37:59.100 --> 01:37:59.700
1 minus.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21142-0
01:37:59.550 --> 01:38:00.070
Minus one.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21140-0
01:37:59.570 --> 01:38:01.370
One this minus.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21136-0
01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:00.160
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21152-0
01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:05.560
One should lie to the right of
the previous.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21161-0
01:38:05.570 --> 01:38:08.990
Uh nonzero element, which is
true, right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21168-0
01:38:09.460 --> 01:38:09.760
Right.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21177-0
01:38:10.230 --> 01:38:10.920
Yeah, just.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21174-0
01:38:10.500 --> 01:38:10.620
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21184-0
01:38:11.500 --> 01:38:13.870
Now come to the third row in the
3rd row.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21183-0
01:38:11.860 --> 01:38:12.100
No.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21189-0
01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:14.800
What is the nonzero element?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21205-0
01:38:15.820 --> 01:38:16.830
Minus 3 minus.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21213-0
01:38:15.930 --> 01:38:16.450
Minus 3.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21203-0
01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:16.950
Minus 3 minus.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21211-0
01:38:16.420 --> 01:38:17.900
Minus 3 -, 3.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21214-0
01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:18.440
3 -, 3 so.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21217-0
01:38:17.020 --> 01:38:17.140
3.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21231-0
01:38:18.540 --> 01:38:21.410
This will come to the right of
minus one.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21228-0
01:38:21.770 --> 01:38:22.190
Penicillin.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21230-0
01:38:22.120 --> 01:38:22.260
To.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21239-0
01:38:22.810 --> 01:38:22.930
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21245-0
01:38:23.190 --> 01:38:25.180
OK, now come to the 4th row.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21252-0
01:38:25.190 --> 01:38:27.240
There is no nonzero element,
correct?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21258-0
01:38:27.950 --> 01:38:28.110
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21255-0
01:38:28.180 --> 01:38:28.320
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21262-0
01:38:28.350 --> 01:38:28.600
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21264-0
01:38:28.690 --> 01:38:28.830
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21281-0
01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:32.259
Now in whenever you find this
nonzero elements which are

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21281-1
01:38:32.259 --> 01:38:33.870
there, they are called pivots.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21300-0
01:38:34.140 --> 01:38:39.790
OK, so the pivots here are 1 -,
1 and minus three. Agree.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21294-0
01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:36.650
Every time.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21303-0
01:38:40.380 --> 01:38:40.620
Hi.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21306-0
01:38:41.430 --> 01:38:41.590
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21320-0
01:38:41.910 --> 01:38:42.830
Yes, yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21322-0
01:38:42.590 --> 01:38:43.310
But Papa.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21346-0
01:38:42.750 --> 01:38:47.590
And any element below the pivots
are should be zeros, so you find

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21324-0
01:38:43.130 --> 01:38:43.430
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21346-1
01:38:47.590 --> 01:38:50.450
the number the 43 zeros below
pivot 1.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21362-0
01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:53.000
Let the color change.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21356-0
01:38:52.630 --> 01:38:52.740
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21355-0
01:38:53.110 --> 01:38:53.240
K.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21366-0
01:38:53.590 --> 01:38:53.730
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21387-0
01:38:54.030 --> 01:38:58.179
You'll find it two elements
below minus 10 and you find one

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21368-0
01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:54.240
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21379-0
01:38:57.320 --> 01:38:57.460
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21378-0
01:38:57.330 --> 01:38:57.470
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21387-1
01:38:58.179 --> 01:39:00.600
element below minus three as
zero.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21394-0
01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:01.500
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21405-0
01:39:02.310 --> 01:39:04.480
Why is the six in the third row
not the pivot?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21410-0
01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:03.630
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21426-0
01:39:04.690 --> 01:39:07.738
Because it it is not the first
nonzero row for nonzero element

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21426-1
01:39:07.738 --> 01:39:08.610
in that row agree.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21430-0
01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:10.110
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21438-0
01:39:09.900 --> 01:39:10.030
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21433-0
01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:10.850
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21455-0
01:39:10.630 --> 01:39:11.130
Thanks.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21451-0
01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:10.810
And.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21440-0
01:39:10.860 --> 01:39:11.220
So this is.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21456-0
01:39:11.050 --> 01:39:11.790
Great. Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21460-0
01:39:11.340 --> 01:39:13.470
The ROIC this is in the row
echelon form.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21479-0
01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:16.625
So what is it that you have
learned in case A is not equal

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21479-1
01:39:16.625 --> 01:39:18.810
to minus one, there is no
solution, correct?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21482-0
01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:21.140
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21497-0
01:39:21.800 --> 01:39:21.960
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21511-0
01:39:22.030 --> 01:39:25.140
OK, it is one what?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21513-0
01:39:22.180 --> 01:39:25.630
It this will always be true for
our performance matrix, right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21501-0
01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:22.620
Right.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21539-0
01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:29.444
What you said will be always be
true for an upper triangular

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21538-0
01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:29.690
For this.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21539-1
01:39:29.444 --> 01:39:29.730
matrix.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21536-0
01:39:30.900 --> 01:39:31.410
Yeah, correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21579-0
01:39:31.420 --> 01:39:34.305
It will be true for an upper
triangular matrices, but this is

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21579-1
01:39:34.305 --> 01:39:36.865
the row echelon form you are
trying to bring it to row

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21579-2
01:39:36.865 --> 01:39:39.425
echelon form where you you try
to find it in the upper

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21579-3
01:39:39.425 --> 01:39:40.170
triangular form.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21585-0
01:39:41.810 --> 01:39:42.120
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21594-0
01:39:43.260 --> 01:39:44.140
Speak now.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21608-0
01:39:43.610 --> 01:39:46.731
So Roy can inform and upper
triangular form are same or will

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21608-1
01:39:46.731 --> 01:39:47.960
there be any difference?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21616-0
01:39:48.950 --> 01:39:50.740
And there isn't much difference
about that.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21619-0
01:39:50.750 --> 01:39:52.090
Only change in terminology.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21624-0
01:39:54.360 --> 01:39:54.650
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21659-0
01:39:56.080 --> 01:40:00.376
So there will be right like in
the previous one if below minus

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21659-1
01:40:00.376 --> 01:40:04.535
one there is 2, it is still an
upper triangular form, but it

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21659-2
01:40:04.535 --> 01:40:04.740
is.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21664-0
01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:06.520
There is which which which minus
one.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21672-0
01:40:07.330 --> 01:40:08.610
Uh, the second pivot.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21695-0
01:40:10.820 --> 01:40:12.880
In the second pivot there no.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21685-0
01:40:11.110 --> 01:40:11.450
Not that.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21700-0
01:40:12.410 --> 01:40:15.040
Yeah, if below minus one, there
is a two.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21722-0
01:40:15.150 --> 01:40:17.310
It is still an upper triangular
form, right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21786-0
01:40:15.150 --> 01:40:20.173
Yeah, the, the, the the point is
this not the point is this is a

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21786-1
01:40:20.173 --> 01:40:25.195
very particular case, but she's
asking in general in general, if

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21786-2
01:40:25.195 --> 01:40:29.832
you see, I mean I can create an
example where those two are

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21786-3
01:40:29.832 --> 01:40:34.546
different, but then in the in
the most general case you will

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21786-4
01:40:34.546 --> 01:40:39.414
have the if you have non pivot
columns then below that it will

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21786-5
01:40:39.414 --> 01:40:40.960
be necessarily zero.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21792-0
01:40:40.970 --> 01:40:41.680
That's what I said.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21817-0
01:40:41.820 --> 01:40:45.109
In the beginning that you can
get the second column by

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21817-1
01:40:45.109 --> 01:40:48.220
multiplying the first column
with something agreed.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21845-0
01:40:48.670 --> 01:40:52.429
Maybe we can say all upper
triangular matrix will be in the

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21845-1
01:40:52.429 --> 01:40:54.810
form but vice versa is not
necessary.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21849-0
01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:57.690
Yeah, the converse is not true,
but it's a very small change.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21869-0
01:40:57.940 --> 01:41:01.936
Now we will not get into this
role equal on form, I mean soon

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21869-1
01:41:01.936 --> 01:41:03.290
we'll come out, yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21916-0
01:41:06.770 --> 01:41:10.791
Upper triangle matrix need not
be Oracle royal form, right row

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21916-1
01:41:10.791 --> 01:41:14.110
echelon form needs uh, last row
all zeros right in.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21904-0
01:41:13.850 --> 01:41:14.460
No, no, no.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21910-0
01:41:14.470 --> 01:41:14.840
No, no, no.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21914-0
01:41:14.850 --> 01:41:15.440
No, no, no.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21919-0
01:41:15.450 --> 01:41:17.200
No, no, no, no. Sorry.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21926-0
01:41:17.810 --> 01:41:19.110
OK, I'll give an example.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21930-0
01:41:21.020 --> 01:41:22.140
So for example.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21957-0
01:41:23.990 --> 01:41:31.748
You will have 3125 and then
you'll find 3 zeros here and

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21957-1
01:41:31.748 --> 01:41:33.110
then 3251.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21970-0
01:41:33.210 --> 01:41:36.610
This is OK then you'll have a
00. Agree.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21997-0
01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:38.280
Umm.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21974-0
01:41:38.340 --> 01:41:38.560
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21984-0
01:41:39.660 --> 01:41:44.280
60 and seven and 12.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/21992-0
01:41:45.170 --> 01:41:45.850
What is this now?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22012-0
01:41:47.270 --> 01:41:48.240
This is upper triangle.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22021-0
01:41:47.390 --> 01:41:48.810
This is upper triangular matrix.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22028-0
01:41:47.980 --> 01:41:49.400
You see other Roy conformant.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22023-0
01:41:48.710 --> 01:41:49.620
This is upper triangular.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22031-0
01:41:49.730 --> 01:41:51.550
You find this upper triangle.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22030-0
01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:50.560
Upper triangle.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22049-0
01:41:53.090 --> 01:41:54.790
But this is not Roy Echelon
form, right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22053-0
01:41:55.270 --> 01:41:56.440
See is also broken from.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22058-0
01:41:56.870 --> 01:41:57.150
Both.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22068-0
01:41:58.430 --> 01:42:00.550
Now, why do you say this is not
in?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22065-0
01:41:58.880 --> 01:41:59.030
But.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22076-0
01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:03.080
Uh, this is not in row echelon
form.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22107-0
01:42:04.510 --> 01:42:08.850
Roy Colon form needs like all 0
rows to be the last row.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22095-0
01:42:04.740 --> 01:42:06.500
Because all.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22104-0
01:42:08.090 --> 01:42:09.810
Well, they're connected.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22113-0
01:42:09.820 --> 01:42:10.900
There is no all zeros.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22131-0
01:42:10.910 --> 01:42:13.510
If at all they exist, only it
has to be in the last three.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22127-0
01:42:12.660 --> 01:42:13.040
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22129-0
01:42:14.630 --> 01:42:15.020
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22140-0
01:42:15.030 --> 01:42:15.280
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22154-0
01:42:15.290 --> 01:42:16.490
OK, got it then yeah, yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22177-0
01:42:15.780 --> 01:42:20.246
It need not be that it is uh, it
should happen if it if it, if

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22177-1
01:42:20.246 --> 01:42:23.720
there is a zero row, it should
come to the last.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22173-0
01:42:20.930 --> 01:42:21.280
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22182-0
01:42:24.010 --> 01:42:25.620
Now 3 is a pivot.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22198-0
01:42:25.690 --> 01:42:28.760
First nonzero element, all the
other other threes are zeros.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22207-0
01:42:29.250 --> 01:42:30.540
Two is the 2nd pivot.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22213-0
01:42:30.550 --> 01:42:31.560
Both of them are zeros.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22219-0
01:42:31.750 --> 01:42:33.080
Six is the third pivot.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22229-0
01:42:33.130 --> 01:42:35.910
This is a zero and seven is a
pivot.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22249-0
01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:38.583
There are no elements which can
be 0, so it is perfectly in row

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22249-1
01:42:38.583 --> 01:42:39.540
equivalent form, right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22253-0
01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:42.270
OK, OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22259-0
01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:43.110
Yeah, got it.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22275-0
01:42:42.730 --> 01:42:44.870
So the OK, fine. OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22267-0
01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:43.480
Got it.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22276-0
01:42:44.540 --> 01:42:45.610
Friends choir metrics.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22291-0
01:42:45.620 --> 01:42:48.820
We have the exact diagonal, but
what about the rectangular

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22291-1
01:42:48.820 --> 01:42:49.200
matrix?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22309-0
01:42:49.210 --> 01:42:50.270
But here we are saying.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22316-0
01:42:49.580 --> 01:42:52.462
No, that they, I mean you you
just take you just take this

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22316-1
01:42:52.462 --> 01:42:53.000
this phone.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22317-0
01:42:54.260 --> 01:42:54.520
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22330-0
01:42:57.090 --> 01:43:00.800
OK, now what happens is and you.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22345-0
01:43:00.810 --> 01:43:06.177
This gives one kind of easy
solution to to getting our

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22345-1
01:43:06.177 --> 01:43:06.860
things.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22364-0
01:43:06.950 --> 01:43:10.956
So you just consider only the
pivot Rao so we columns so this

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22364-1
01:43:10.956 --> 01:43:11.280
is 1.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22373-0
01:43:11.890 --> 01:43:13.940
This is one and what is other
one?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22376-0
01:43:15.090 --> 01:43:15.640
Minus 3.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22379-0
01:43:17.330 --> 01:43:18.120
What is minus 3?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22387-0
01:43:20.970 --> 01:43:22.200
Minus one is.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22388-0
01:43:21.770 --> 01:43:22.220
Pivot.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22389-0
01:43:21.940 --> 01:43:22.200
Not.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22393-0
01:43:24.170 --> 01:43:24.650
What color?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22399-0
01:43:27.680 --> 01:43:28.390
No, I didn't get it.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22412-0
01:43:32.340 --> 01:43:33.470
Minus three is another pivot.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22411-0
01:43:32.470 --> 01:43:33.040
I didn't get it.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22427-0
01:43:39.350 --> 01:43:41.600
Yeah, I can take this.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22430-0
01:43:40.880 --> 01:43:42.210
So could you repeat your
question?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22441-0
01:43:43.490 --> 01:43:46.100
No, I'm saying, what are the
Tibet columns now?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22465-0
01:43:46.110 --> 01:43:51.763
I say if I if I if I divide this
entire thing by one by three,

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22465-1
01:43:51.763 --> 01:43:53.020
what do I get?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22473-0
01:43:55.610 --> 01:43:56.800
You get a -, 1 here.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22488-0
01:43:59.570 --> 01:44:00.490
You get it too here.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22492-0
01:43:59.820 --> 01:44:00.890
Yeah. Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22486-0
01:44:00.440 --> 01:44:00.620
2.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22493-0
01:44:00.740 --> 01:44:00.960
Yep.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22499-0
01:44:01.350 --> 01:44:01.990
Yes, yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22494-0
01:44:01.470 --> 01:44:01.680
Just.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22510-0
01:44:03.330 --> 01:44:05.190
And you get a -, 1 here,
correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22514-0
01:44:06.050 --> 01:44:06.190
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22515-0
01:44:06.380 --> 01:44:06.700
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22516-0
01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:07.140
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22517-0
01:44:07.310 --> 01:44:07.540
You know.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22523-0
01:44:10.870 --> 01:44:11.310
Do you agree?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22541-0
01:44:12.940 --> 01:44:13.830
This talk.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22535-0
01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:13.850
Yes, yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22537-0
01:44:13.340 --> 01:44:13.520
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22538-0
01:44:13.410 --> 01:44:13.550
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22542-0
01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:14.320
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22544-0
01:44:15.120 --> 01:44:16.010
OK, fine.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22557-0
01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:19.740
So the point is and this will be
the pivot.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22563-0
01:44:20.020 --> 01:44:21.640
Yeah, stuff. Right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22577-0
01:44:22.740 --> 01:44:26.400
What minus one one and this
minus one.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22568-0
01:44:23.010 --> 01:44:23.170
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22576-0
01:44:25.580 --> 01:44:26.180
Minus one.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22583-0
01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:28.770
Correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22590-0
01:44:29.020 --> 01:44:30.750
The six is not the pivot
element.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22589-0
01:44:29.170 --> 01:44:29.310
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22607-0
01:44:30.820 --> 01:44:33.737
Please understand this is not
the first nonzero is through row

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22607-1
01:44:33.737 --> 01:44:33.830
3.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22630-0
01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:38.110
Is this minus 3 minus the minus
10 -, 3, whatever it is?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22623-0
01:44:34.780 --> 01:44:35.310
Minus one.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22627-0
01:44:35.550 --> 01:44:36.130
Minus one.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22654-0
01:44:38.540 --> 01:44:43.011
So this minus one 1 -, 1 is what
we have taken here or minus 1 -,

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22654-1
01:44:43.011 --> 01:44:44.570
1, one, whatever it is.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22671-0
01:44:45.020 --> 01:44:49.690
You can take this so Lambda one
times 1000 plus Lambda 2 times.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22689-0
01:44:49.700 --> 01:44:55.308
This plus Lambda three times
this will be equal to 0 -, 2,

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22689-1
01:44:55.308 --> 01:44:57.210
one, zero, where is.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22699-0
01:44:57.220 --> 01:44:59.750
Where are we getting this 0 -,
2, one, zero?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22708-0
01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:02.730
This is 0 -, 2, one, zero.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22719-0
01:45:02.980 --> 01:45:06.130
You are getting it here now this
is very easy to solve, right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22723-0
01:45:11.460 --> 01:45:11.910
Got it.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22727-0
01:45:12.310 --> 01:45:12.520
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22735-0
01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:15.620
Why is it very easy to solve?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22753-0
01:45:15.860 --> 01:45:19.003
You take Lambda one, you
multiply with one, you take only

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22786-0
01:45:16.520 --> 01:45:16.910
Good.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22753-1
01:45:19.003 --> 01:45:20.250
the pivot columns here.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22785-0
01:45:20.760 --> 01:45:24.433
So wherever you have the pivot
elements now that calling you

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22785-1
01:45:24.433 --> 01:45:28.407
take so you take Lambda one plus
Lambda 2 minus Lambda 3 equal to

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22785-2
01:45:28.407 --> 01:45:29.070
0, correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22793-0
01:45:31.550 --> 01:45:31.690
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22825-0
01:45:31.700 --> 01:45:36.790
The first equation you just take
the third equation 0 Lambda 1 +

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22812-0
01:45:32.140 --> 01:45:34.380
Yes, that's yes, that's it.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22801-0
01:45:32.750 --> 01:45:32.890
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22809-0
01:45:34.910 --> 01:45:35.030
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22825-1
01:45:36.790 --> 01:45:39.610
0 Lambda 2 + 1 Lambda 3 equal to
1.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22832-0
01:45:39.620 --> 01:45:40.440
So what is Lambda 3?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22839-0
01:45:41.140 --> 01:45:41.460
Right.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22843-0
01:45:41.890 --> 01:45:42.210
1.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22844-0
01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:42.220
1.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22837-0
01:45:42.070 --> 01:45:42.500
One.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22848-0
01:45:42.590 --> 01:45:44.340
OK, so I've got Lambda 3.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22874-0
01:45:44.470 --> 01:45:49.380
You take now the second the the
second equation 0 Lambda 1 + 1

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22874-1
01:45:49.380 --> 01:45:52.810
Lambda 2 minus Lambda 3 equal to
minus two.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22885-0
01:45:52.820 --> 01:45:54.160
You know all the value of Lambda
3.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22904-0
01:45:54.170 --> 01:45:55.360
So can we get the value of
Lambda 2?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22916-0
01:45:55.980 --> 01:45:57.360
Lambda 2 = -, 1.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22909-0
01:45:56.250 --> 01:45:56.700
Minus 2.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22915-0
01:45:56.980 --> 01:45:57.240
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22919-0
01:45:57.090 --> 01:45:57.290
Right.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22912-0
01:45:57.370 --> 01:45:57.660
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22929-0
01:45:58.250 --> 01:46:01.460
Now what happens is you know
Lambda 2 and Lambda 3.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22945-0
01:46:01.770 --> 01:46:05.694
You come to the first equation
Lambda one plus Lambda 2 minus

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22945-1
01:46:05.694 --> 01:46:06.960
Lambda 3 equal to 0.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22956-0
01:46:07.410 --> 01:46:09.000
So can you not get the value of
Lambda 1?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22962-0
01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:10.520
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22971-0
01:46:11.130 --> 01:46:12.550
He is speaking OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22979-0
01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:12.280
Yes. Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22978-0
01:46:11.860 --> 01:46:12.040
Yep.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22969-0
01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:12.640
Yes, yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22981-0
01:46:12.780 --> 01:46:12.880
Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22973-0
01:46:12.950 --> 01:46:13.140
So.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22998-0
01:46:13.210 --> 01:46:17.336
That is how you get you get
Lambda 3 is 1, Lambda 2 is -, 1

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/22998-1
01:46:17.336 --> 01:46:18.850
Lambda 1 equal to two.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23002-0
01:46:21.080 --> 01:46:21.380
Agree.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23004-0
01:46:22.030 --> 01:46:22.150
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23012-0
01:46:22.880 --> 01:46:23.020
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23013-0
01:46:23.020 --> 01:46:23.120
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23019-0
01:46:23.220 --> 01:46:26.530
So that is how you get there
particular solution correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23024-0
01:46:28.200 --> 01:46:28.380
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23030-0
01:46:28.940 --> 01:46:29.060
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23049-0
01:46:29.250 --> 01:46:29.400
I'm.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23047-0
01:46:30.250 --> 01:46:35.111
To find out the solutions of a X
equal to zero, we look at the

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23047-1
01:46:35.111 --> 01:46:36.500
non pivot columns.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23050-0
01:46:39.090 --> 01:46:39.390
Agree.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23058-0
01:46:43.620 --> 01:46:44.940
Now what are the non period
columns?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23076-0
01:46:47.930 --> 01:46:48.750
What does that mean?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23087-0
01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:50.350
Why do we want to solve for X is
equal to 0?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23088-0
01:46:50.870 --> 01:46:51.980
I told you now, Madam.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23091-0
01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:51.440
Volume 2.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23127-0
01:46:51.990 --> 01:46:56.203
Already, if you have a system to
solve, like a X equal to B, you

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23127-1
01:46:56.203 --> 01:47:00.027
try it now I told you how to
find X not which solves the X

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23127-2
01:47:00.027 --> 01:47:00.740
equal to B.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23137-0
01:47:00.750 --> 01:47:02.530
So you'll have a X not equal to
B.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23151-0
01:47:03.170 --> 01:47:06.760
Now I try to find the solution
of AY equal to 0.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23166-0
01:47:07.030 --> 01:47:09.880
Suppose I find Y equal to Y not
as a solution.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23176-0
01:47:10.170 --> 01:47:13.520
Then my solution is basically X
naughty plus OK, why not?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23187-0
01:47:14.110 --> 01:47:16.990
Why if I type apply X, what is
ax not?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23196-0
01:47:20.340 --> 01:47:22.550
BB B + K.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23198-0
01:47:20.570 --> 01:47:21.040
Be.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23200-0
01:47:21.010 --> 01:47:21.460
Be.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23205-0
01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:21.950
Be.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23209-0
01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:24.090
Times a Y not what is a?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23214-0
01:47:24.100 --> 01:47:24.510
Why not?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23225-0
01:47:25.080 --> 01:47:25.550
Zero.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23236-0
01:47:25.830 --> 01:47:26.130
0.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23228-0
01:47:25.950 --> 01:47:26.500
0.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23227-0
01:47:25.990 --> 01:47:26.650
Do you think?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23229-0
01:47:26.060 --> 01:47:26.630
Yeah, we.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23241-0
01:47:26.740 --> 01:47:28.110
Plus zero, which is equal to be.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23245-0
01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:29.580
So my solution is here right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23255-0
01:47:34.020 --> 01:47:34.180
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23252-0
01:47:34.060 --> 01:47:34.220
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23258-0
01:47:34.620 --> 01:47:34.940
Correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23261-0
01:47:34.750 --> 01:47:37.550
Yeah, that's correct, but yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23260-0
01:47:35.630 --> 01:47:35.950
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23301-0
01:47:41.830 --> 01:47:45.229
The Yeah, the the point is, the
point is I already made a

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23301-1
01:47:45.229 --> 01:47:48.452
statement saying that there is
either a case of unique

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23301-2
01:47:48.452 --> 01:47:51.500
solution, no solution or
infinitely many solutions.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23317-0
01:47:51.930 --> 01:47:54.836
Now, if you're able to find one
solution, don't think that that

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23317-1
01:47:54.836 --> 01:47:55.790
is the only solution.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23320-0
01:48:00.860 --> 01:48:01.140
Agree.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23328-0
01:48:03.010 --> 01:48:03.170
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23341-0
01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:07.660
If you find 1 solution, don't
think that is the only solution.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23329-0
01:48:03.430 --> 01:48:03.760
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23365-0
01:48:07.670 --> 01:48:13.739
If you go back to the slide, for
example, I go back here and then

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23365-1
01:48:13.739 --> 01:48:16.590
I say that 42800 is a solution.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23376-0
01:48:20.010 --> 01:48:23.190
OK, now this is a solution,
correct?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23389-0
01:48:26.490 --> 01:48:28.430
42800 solution or not?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23393-0
01:48:32.230 --> 01:48:32.370
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23402-0
01:48:32.950 --> 01:48:33.870
Yes, yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23396-0
01:48:33.080 --> 01:48:33.180
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23399-0
01:48:33.380 --> 01:48:33.520
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23418-0
01:48:34.570 --> 01:48:38.429
So don't conclude that you have
only one solution which is

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23418-1
01:48:38.429 --> 01:48:39.280
called 42800.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23431-0
01:48:39.290 --> 01:48:42.170
You'll be forced to come to
conclude that we are right.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23438-0
01:48:47.590 --> 01:48:48.250
You get my point.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23441-0
01:48:49.200 --> 01:48:49.640
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23451-0
01:48:50.360 --> 01:48:50.500
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23450-0
01:48:50.410 --> 01:48:50.530
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23462-0
01:48:50.850 --> 01:48:53.940
Don't conclude that 42800 is the
only solution.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23486-0
01:48:53.950 --> 01:48:56.997
I am saying you try to find a
solution of X equal to 0,

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23486-1
01:48:56.997 --> 01:49:00.100
probably the infinitely many
stuff will come from there.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23498-0
01:49:00.430 --> 01:49:03.490
That is the reason I am trying
to do this analysis.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23504-0
01:49:03.500 --> 01:49:04.770
Yeah, it's equal to zero also.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23507-0
01:49:06.390 --> 01:49:06.750
Agreed.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23519-0
01:49:07.700 --> 01:49:08.040
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23524-0
01:49:09.030 --> 01:49:09.950
Now the strategy.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23539-0
01:49:09.070 --> 01:49:12.664
Their graphically graphically,
if we have a unique solution

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23539-1
01:49:12.664 --> 01:49:15.180
means they're intersecting at
that point.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23560-0
01:49:15.190 --> 01:49:18.812
But if we have multiple
solution, what is the graphical

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23560-1
01:49:18.812 --> 01:49:19.330
analogy?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23562-0
01:49:18.840 --> 01:49:21.360
One is 1, one is lying on top of
the other.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23580-0
01:49:23.610 --> 01:49:24.660
There are overlapping.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23584-0
01:49:24.910 --> 01:49:25.530
Overlapping.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23595-0
01:49:25.820 --> 01:49:29.170
That you try to find this if you
find something like this.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23599-0
01:49:29.440 --> 01:49:30.620
This is a unique solution,
correct?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23608-0
01:49:32.850 --> 01:49:33.230
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23630-0
01:49:33.940 --> 01:49:37.195
But if you find something like
this one and then the second one

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23630-1
01:49:37.195 --> 01:49:40.450
lies on top of this, then it'll
have infinitely many solutions.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23643-0
01:49:40.920 --> 01:49:42.590
Any point here would be a
solution, correct?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23650-0
01:49:44.150 --> 01:49:44.430
Correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23663-0
01:49:45.350 --> 01:49:47.829
And if you have something like
this parallel lines there you

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23663-1
01:49:47.829 --> 01:49:49.090
will find no solutions correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23670-0
01:49:50.020 --> 01:49:50.580
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23685-0
01:49:51.230 --> 01:49:55.762
So what I'm trying to find out
is I am trying to find out AX

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23685-1
01:49:55.762 --> 01:49:56.580
equal to B.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23708-0
01:49:56.590 --> 01:50:00.519
The solution there and the AX
equal to 0 and combine them so

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23708-1
01:50:00.519 --> 01:50:02.580
that I get my complete solution.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23727-0
01:50:03.150 --> 01:50:08.293
OK, So what I try to do is I try
to now play around with these

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23727-1
01:50:08.293 --> 01:50:08.620
two.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23739-0
01:50:08.660 --> 01:50:12.120
So for example, what are the
pivot columns here?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23756-0
01:50:12.180 --> 01:50:14.540
So for example, the first row,
the one is that we were right.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23769-0
01:50:16.440 --> 01:50:16.580
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23767-0
01:50:16.620 --> 01:50:18.280
Yep, in this this.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23774-0
01:50:16.790 --> 01:50:16.990
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23781-0
01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:19.030
Is a pivot right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23788-0
01:50:18.790 --> 01:50:19.820
The problem is here.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23790-0
01:50:20.360 --> 01:50:21.430
And this is a pivot, right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23796-0
01:50:22.890 --> 01:50:24.790
Yes, now using.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23816-0
01:50:23.900 --> 01:50:24.320
It's.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23799-0
01:50:23.930 --> 01:50:24.130
No.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23813-0
01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:29.700
The pivot you try to generate
the non pivot columns.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23815-0
01:50:31.510 --> 01:50:32.020
Can you do that?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23827-0
01:50:34.020 --> 01:50:34.980
Is 2 and four.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23826-0
01:50:34.430 --> 01:50:34.550
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23833-0
01:50:35.650 --> 01:50:38.010
How can you?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23841-0
01:50:37.300 --> 01:50:37.830
Multiply.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23848-0
01:50:38.070 --> 01:50:39.320
Can you generate this?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23844-0
01:50:38.440 --> 01:50:39.030
Two and four.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23856-0
01:50:40.180 --> 01:50:42.040
But from the first column.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23858-0
01:50:42.960 --> 01:50:44.080
Yeah, multiply with three.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23872-0
01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:49.170
OK, for example, you want to
generate this land, can you?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23879-0
01:50:49.230 --> 01:50:50.460
How do you generate this lion?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23917-0
01:50:55.510 --> 01:50:57.280
Very simple minus 9.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23892-0
01:50:55.860 --> 01:50:57.120
Add 9 multiplied.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23900-0
01:50:56.340 --> 01:50:56.850
Multiply.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23947-0
01:50:56.980 --> 01:51:00.986
If, if, if, if you if you if you
want to generate this column you

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23895-0
01:50:57.030 --> 01:50:57.230
For.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23920-0
01:50:57.180 --> 01:50:57.980
With 99.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23921-0
01:50:57.330 --> 01:50:58.150
In 3 by 9.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23947-1
01:51:00.986 --> 01:51:04.992
say three times the first column
plus nine times the third column

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23947-2
01:51:04.992 --> 01:51:08.270
minus four terms, the 5th
column, 4th column correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23959-0
01:51:09.380 --> 01:51:10.540
Yes, yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23958-0
01:51:10.090 --> 01:51:10.230
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23960-0
01:51:10.250 --> 01:51:10.650
Thanks Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23961-0
01:51:10.410 --> 01:51:11.160
Have you give me this?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23963-0
01:51:14.690 --> 01:51:14.990
Agree.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23981-0
01:51:16.970 --> 01:51:17.600
Not getting it.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23982-0
01:51:17.080 --> 01:51:17.870
Yeah, I agree, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23984-0
01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:19.120
Yeah, great.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/23986-0
01:51:18.290 --> 01:51:19.280
Yes, yes, got it.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24019-0
01:51:20.630 --> 01:51:25.156
Three times the first column
minus the second column will

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24019-1
01:51:25.156 --> 01:51:30.307
give you 0 three times the first
column plus nine times the third

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24019-2
01:51:30.307 --> 01:51:32.180
column minus four terms.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24031-0
01:51:32.190 --> 01:51:36.910
The third column will give you
this light green 9 -, 4.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24037-0
01:51:38.260 --> 01:51:38.380
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24048-0
01:51:38.710 --> 01:51:39.270
It's just.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24043-0
01:51:38.790 --> 01:51:38.910
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24053-0
01:51:39.500 --> 01:51:39.880
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24045-0
01:51:39.530 --> 01:51:40.180
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24055-0
01:51:40.300 --> 01:51:41.700
That's what we're trying to do.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24082-0
01:51:41.750 --> 01:51:45.696
So there is one solution called
3 minus 1000, correct three

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24082-1
01:51:45.696 --> 01:51:48.920
times the first column minus
second column is 0.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24080-0
01:51:46.440 --> 01:51:46.560
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24089-0
01:51:49.050 --> 01:51:50.380
What is second solution?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24120-0
01:51:50.790 --> 01:51:55.009
You try to find 3/10 of First
column plus 9/10 of the second

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24120-1
01:51:55.009 --> 01:51:59.160
column minus 4/10, but the 4th
column minus the 5th column.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24125-0
01:51:59.170 --> 01:52:00.150
We'll give you a 0, correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24127-0
01:52:02.800 --> 01:52:02.980
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24134-0
01:52:04.540 --> 01:52:06.210
So these are two solutions.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24156-0
01:52:06.220 --> 01:52:08.839
So you add Lambda one times the
first one plus Lambda 2 is in

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24156-1
01:52:08.839 --> 01:52:11.290
second time, so this will be the
general solution. Agree.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24162-0
01:52:14.140 --> 01:52:14.420
You just.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24163-0
01:52:14.920 --> 01:52:15.340
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24168-0
01:52:18.350 --> 01:52:18.630
Agree.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24170-0
01:52:19.850 --> 01:52:20.230
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24194-0
01:52:20.240 --> 01:52:24.391
So this uh, from the point of
view, so how the question will

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24194-1
01:52:24.391 --> 01:52:26.910
be asked by having all this
concept.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24209-0
01:52:29.490 --> 01:52:32.013
You will be asked to find the
solutions of system of

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24209-1
01:52:32.013 --> 01:52:32.490
equations.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24230-0
01:52:40.480 --> 01:52:44.650
OK, there is now the last one
which is EA is is amply clear.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24241-0
01:52:44.660 --> 01:52:46.600
Or should I explain little more
of this?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24245-0
01:52:46.610 --> 01:52:47.630
We're taking one more example.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24259-0
01:52:50.270 --> 01:52:50.960
So do we all?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24269-0
01:52:50.640 --> 01:52:51.760
Son, I have one though.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24266-0
01:52:50.890 --> 01:52:51.050
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24271-0
01:52:51.910 --> 01:52:52.590
You can't using.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24274-0
01:52:52.810 --> 01:52:53.890
One more example please.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24279-0
01:52:54.870 --> 01:52:55.490
Yeah, sure.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24297-0
01:52:55.720 --> 01:52:58.891
What have more practical
approach for this to understand

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24297-1
01:52:58.891 --> 01:52:59.170
that?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24288-0
01:52:59.230 --> 01:52:59.400
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24310-0
01:52:59.560 --> 01:53:04.160
You also explain this next bar
next not like you explain how.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24316-0
01:53:04.250 --> 01:53:05.710
How are you coming to this
point?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24318-0
01:53:05.720 --> 01:53:05.970
Right.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24331-0
01:53:06.170 --> 01:53:09.556
And introduce the another
variable called K So I didn't

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24331-1
01:53:09.556 --> 01:53:09.980
get it.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24392-0
01:53:12.390 --> 01:53:21.415
I don't know how successful
because external both, but this

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24392-1
01:53:21.415 --> 01:53:31.342
is I will say X1 plus X2 plus X3
equal to 7 and then 2 X 1 -, 3 X

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24392-2
01:53:31.342 --> 01:53:40.668
2 + 4 X 3 equal to 9 and then 3
X 1 -, 2 X 2 + 5 X 3 equal to

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24392-3
01:53:40.668 --> 01:53:41.120
16.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24397-0
01:53:41.530 --> 01:53:42.500
Can we take this system?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24405-0
01:53:44.750 --> 01:53:44.870
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24442-0
01:53:45.730 --> 01:53:45.910
Sure.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24444-0
01:53:46.100 --> 01:53:51.019
Now if you do this, you do this
111 and then there is a 7 and

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24444-1
01:53:51.019 --> 01:53:55.700
then 2 -, 3, four, and then
there is a 9 and 3 -, 2, five,

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24444-2
01:53:55.700 --> 01:53:58.160
and then there is a 16 correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24451-0
01:53:59.750 --> 01:53:59.890
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24457-0
01:54:00.840 --> 01:54:00.960
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24458-0
01:54:00.910 --> 01:54:01.100
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24478-0
01:54:01.530 --> 01:54:05.209
This is what is augmented matrix
and now I'm trying to convert it

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24465-0
01:54:01.830 --> 01:54:01.930
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24478-1
01:54:05.209 --> 01:54:05.600
to RER.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24488-0
01:54:05.610 --> 01:54:07.520
Whatever I want, I can do the
conversion.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24513-0
01:54:07.710 --> 01:54:12.095
So this is 2 times what I will
do is I the row two will be

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24513-1
01:54:12.095 --> 01:54:14.920
transformed to row 2 -, 2 * R
one OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24519-0
01:54:17.300 --> 01:54:17.480
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24547-0
01:54:18.280 --> 01:54:22.916
So that will make 111 and seven
and then this too will become

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24547-1
01:54:22.916 --> 01:54:23.290
zero.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24555-0
01:54:23.300 --> 01:54:29.010
Correct minus 5 two 9 -.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24541-0
01:54:23.840 --> 01:54:24.560
Zero, yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24550-0
01:54:27.230 --> 01:54:27.910
Yeah, let me.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24562-0
01:54:29.440 --> 01:54:32.380
14 is minus by correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24567-0
01:54:34.750 --> 01:54:34.930
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24568-0
01:54:34.810 --> 01:54:35.030
Right.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24575-0
01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:37.880
Agree.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24577-0
01:54:38.560 --> 01:54:39.790
Uh, what you did?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24597-0
01:54:39.800 --> 01:54:42.080
I missed that R2 this.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24604-0
01:54:41.420 --> 01:54:44.940
R2 is a row two from row 2,
subtract 2 * R one.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24614-0
01:54:46.260 --> 01:54:46.540
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24639-0
01:54:47.640 --> 01:54:54.105
So this 2 -, 2 into 1 -, 3 -, 2
into one, 4 * 4 -, 2 into one, 9

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24612-0
01:54:47.670 --> 01:54:47.960
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24623-0
01:54:47.970 --> 01:54:48.590
We're trying to.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24639-1
01:54:54.105 --> 01:54:55.200
* 2 into 7.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24668-0
01:54:57.460 --> 01:55:03.600
That you this role now here this
is R3 going to R 3 -, 3, R one.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24671-0
01:55:03.650 --> 01:55:04.700
Three times harder, yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24707-0
01:55:04.800 --> 01:55:11.594
OK, so this becomes 0 -, 2 -, 3
is minus 5 by minus three, is 2

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24675-0
01:55:05.110 --> 01:55:05.290
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24696-0
01:55:08.190 --> 01:55:08.970
Minus 5.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24705-0
01:55:10.810 --> 01:55:11.050
Tool.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24707-1
01:55:11.594 --> 01:55:12.550
and 16 -.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24712-0
01:55:12.560 --> 01:55:13.780
21 is minus 5.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24713-0
01:55:14.320 --> 01:55:14.780
This time.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24718-0
01:55:16.800 --> 01:55:17.160
Agreed.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24724-0
01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:18.700
Yeah you can.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24752-0
01:55:19.620 --> 01:55:24.251
Speaker, now what he'll do, I
will do is I will simply say R3

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24730-0
01:55:19.850 --> 01:55:20.010
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24752-1
01:55:24.251 --> 01:55:25.820
goes to R 3 -, R two.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24756-0
01:55:26.840 --> 01:55:27.020
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24759-0
01:55:27.250 --> 01:55:27.870
Yep, Yep.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24762-0
01:55:27.460 --> 01:55:29.930
So this is 111 and seven.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24787-0
01:55:30.260 --> 01:55:35.142
This is zero -, 5, two, and a
five negative, and then the 000

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24787-1
01:55:35.142 --> 01:55:36.560
and the 0 correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24789-0
01:55:37.410 --> 01:55:37.610
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24790-0
01:55:37.810 --> 01:55:37.980
No.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24793-0
01:55:37.870 --> 01:55:38.890
Yes. Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24799-0
01:55:39.670 --> 01:55:43.330
OK, so now the question is.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24807-0
01:55:45.610 --> 01:55:46.980
Now the question is very simple.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24815-0
01:55:50.460 --> 01:55:51.690
What are the pivot rows?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24824-0
01:55:51.740 --> 01:55:53.130
So what are the pivot elements?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24887-0
01:55:53.180 --> 01:55:56.080
So can I mark it in drill color
one is the pivot element.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24849-0
01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:54.200
One.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24858-0
01:55:55.010 --> 01:55:55.990
1 -, 5.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24854-0
01:55:55.570 --> 01:55:56.020
Yeah, and.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24856-0
01:55:55.660 --> 01:55:55.940
Why?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24865-0
01:55:56.070 --> 01:55:56.320
Minus.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24883-0
01:55:57.010 --> 01:55:58.550
Minus 5 -, 5.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24868-0
01:55:57.220 --> 01:55:57.450
Where?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24892-0
01:55:57.350 --> 01:55:59.460
Honestly, I stay.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24880-0
01:55:57.460 --> 01:55:58.050
This for you.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24896-0
01:55:57.800 --> 01:55:59.130
Honest fight, yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24898-0
01:55:58.220 --> 01:55:58.710
That's fine.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24908-0
01:55:59.510 --> 01:56:00.270
That's it, right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24900-0
01:55:59.650 --> 01:55:59.950
You know.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24911-0
01:56:00.690 --> 01:56:00.960
That.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24909-0
01:56:00.690 --> 01:56:01.880
Ditto hello.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24918-0
01:56:00.900 --> 01:56:01.480
Just second.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24919-0
01:56:02.430 --> 01:56:03.270
Last week, zero.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24923-0
01:56:03.280 --> 01:56:04.610
There is no nonzero element,
right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24935-0
01:56:06.890 --> 01:56:07.480
Right, right.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24954-0
01:56:08.290 --> 01:56:11.925
There is no nonzero element
there, so you will find one this

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24941-0
01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:08.950
Yeah, one.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24954-1
01:56:11.925 --> 01:56:12.700
only correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24953-0
01:56:11.930 --> 01:56:12.540
Like this wife.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24955-0
01:56:12.860 --> 01:56:13.430
Minus 5.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24972-0
01:56:15.390 --> 01:56:15.590
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24975-0
01:56:15.560 --> 01:56:17.660
One man, minus five, are the
only to give an element.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24989-0
01:56:17.670 --> 01:56:20.550
You agree with me, OK?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24987-0
01:56:18.900 --> 01:56:19.020
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24992-0
01:56:19.030 --> 01:56:19.970
Yes, yeah, yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/24993-0
01:56:19.570 --> 01:56:19.990
Yes, yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25008-0
01:56:21.080 --> 01:56:25.130
Now the question is, how will
you to generate this?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25011-0
01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:27.190
Uh.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25031-0
01:56:27.780 --> 01:56:31.288
From the pivot rows, so I will
find try to find the particular

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25031-1
01:56:31.288 --> 01:56:31.790
solution.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25038-0
01:56:31.800 --> 01:56:32.990
What is the particular solution?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25045-0
01:56:33.280 --> 01:56:38.120
I will say Lambda one into 10.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25070-0
01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:47.190
Plus Lambda 2 into 1 -, 5 equal
to 7 -, 5 I will just try to

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25070-1
01:56:47.190 --> 01:56:49.640
solve this system now.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25075-0
01:56:49.770 --> 01:56:50.980
Take the second equation.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25080-0
01:56:50.990 --> 01:56:51.860
So what is Lambda 2?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25093-0
01:56:55.720 --> 01:56:59.280
So Lambda 2 should be 6.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25089-0
01:56:57.770 --> 01:56:58.150
7.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25090-0
01:56:58.480 --> 01:56:58.820
Umm.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25105-0
01:57:00.950 --> 01:57:02.760
Hey this is equal to two
equations.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25108-0
01:57:01.190 --> 01:57:01.420
So.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25111-0
01:57:02.770 --> 01:57:03.530
You were able to get it.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25121-0
01:57:04.230 --> 01:57:06.030
1111.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25124-0
01:57:04.980 --> 01:57:05.300
1.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25142-0
01:57:05.440 --> 01:57:10.450
That Lambda one plus Lambda 2
equal to 7 -, 5 Lambda 2 equal

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25131-0
01:57:06.240 --> 01:57:06.440
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25132-0
01:57:06.690 --> 01:57:06.880
1.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25142-1
01:57:10.450 --> 01:57:11.600
to minus five.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25150-0
01:57:11.700 --> 01:57:12.590
So what is Lambda 2?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25152-0
01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:13.840
1.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25200-0
01:57:13.950 --> 01:57:18.583
So one thing I've not getting,
one thing I'm not getting why

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25171-0
01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:15.160
11.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25182-0
01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:17.510
Minus 111, sorry.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25183-0
01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:17.720
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25200-1
01:57:18.583 --> 01:57:21.850
you took that Lambda one after
Lambda 110.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25202-0
01:57:21.970 --> 01:57:22.230
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25218-0
01:57:22.030 --> 01:57:25.973
I have so as per the theory I am
supposed to generate the right

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25218-1
01:57:25.973 --> 01:57:28.130
hand side from that pivot
columns.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25225-0
01:57:31.490 --> 01:57:31.810
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25234-0
01:57:32.720 --> 01:57:34.010
So how do we generate this?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25259-0
01:57:34.020 --> 01:57:36.581
I take Lambda 1 some multiple of
the first column plus some

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25259-1
01:57:36.581 --> 01:57:39.270
multiple second column should be
equal to the right hand side.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25291-0
01:57:39.620 --> 01:57:42.656
So I want to find one particular
solution right, so I when I do

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25291-1
01:57:42.656 --> 01:57:45.503
that I'm getting Lambda 2 equal
to 1 and Lambda one will be

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25291-2
01:57:45.503 --> 01:57:46.310
equal to 6 right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25295-0
01:57:48.080 --> 01:57:48.260
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25299-0
01:57:48.790 --> 01:57:49.810
Yes. Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25298-0
01:57:49.240 --> 01:57:49.490
Umm.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25302-0
01:57:49.910 --> 01:57:50.390
Yep, Yep.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25304-0
01:57:50.590 --> 01:57:51.900
I agree.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25319-0
01:57:53.660 --> 01:57:54.240
Night take.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25335-0
01:57:53.690 --> 01:57:58.030
So what I find is the six comma,
one comma 0 is going to be a

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25322-0
01:57:54.620 --> 01:57:55.000
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25335-1
01:57:58.030 --> 01:58:00.060
solution to my system, right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25349-0
01:58:03.370 --> 01:58:03.510
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25347-0
01:58:03.580 --> 01:58:05.140
Yes, this is what.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25355-0
01:58:04.280 --> 01:58:05.080
Yes, so.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25358-0
01:58:04.510 --> 01:58:04.690
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25363-0
01:58:05.200 --> 01:58:06.380
You it's equal to B, right?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25381-0
01:58:05.800 --> 01:58:15.990
111111 so you if you if you just
put a 610, is it solving this?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25385-0
01:58:19.640 --> 01:58:19.790
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25384-0
01:58:19.730 --> 01:58:19.850
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25387-0
01:58:22.160 --> 01:58:22.340
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25389-0
01:58:24.590 --> 01:58:24.710
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25410-0
01:58:29.340 --> 01:58:31.480
How it is solving Venkat Sir?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25426-0
01:58:31.060 --> 01:58:32.190
Ohh not solving that.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25436-0
01:58:31.490 --> 01:58:34.210
Here 610 this is how. Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25421-0
01:58:31.840 --> 01:58:32.330
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25434-0
01:58:32.290 --> 01:58:33.190
It is not solving.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25424-0
01:58:32.380 --> 01:58:33.530
Sad. Sad. Sad.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25430-0
01:58:33.540 --> 01:58:33.950
Sad.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25437-0
01:58:33.960 --> 01:58:35.350
Just give me one second, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25449-0
01:58:35.780 --> 01:58:39.350
One into 6 + 1 into one is 77.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25461-0
01:58:40.870 --> 01:58:41.960
So we are multiplying.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25464-0
01:58:42.960 --> 01:58:43.270
No.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25467-0
01:58:43.060 --> 01:58:43.650
X equal to.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25475-0
01:58:43.280 --> 01:58:47.050
Into six, 1212 -, 3 is 9, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25507-0
01:58:47.590 --> 01:58:50.560
Three into six is 1818 -, 2 is
16, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25480-0
01:58:47.610 --> 01:58:47.940
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25495-0
01:58:47.950 --> 01:58:48.450
Yeah, got it.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25506-0
01:58:48.990 --> 01:58:50.900
Yeah, it makes equals to be.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25515-0
01:58:51.580 --> 01:58:53.800
So 610 is solving our system,
correct?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25522-0
01:58:54.550 --> 01:58:54.890
Yep, Yep.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25520-0
01:58:55.040 --> 01:58:55.390
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25544-0
01:58:55.400 --> 01:58:56.210
Yes, yes, yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25547-0
01:58:55.400 --> 01:58:56.560
Yeah, it is equal to be, yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25554-0
01:58:55.730 --> 01:58:59.180
But don't, but don't think that
610 is the only solution.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25550-0
01:58:56.150 --> 01:58:56.730
Agree, yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25558-0
01:58:59.190 --> 01:58:59.890
That is my point.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25560-0
01:59:00.680 --> 01:59:01.000
Right.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25578-0
01:59:02.030 --> 01:59:05.613
Now the point is I have found
610 through a systematic

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25578-1
01:59:05.613 --> 01:59:06.200
approach.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25583-0
01:59:06.210 --> 01:59:06.540
You are.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25602-0
01:59:06.550 --> 01:59:09.150
You're able to say that I am not
guessing 610 correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25613-0
01:59:10.260 --> 01:59:10.480
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25616-0
01:59:10.320 --> 01:59:10.800
Yeah, right.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25619-0
01:59:10.400 --> 01:59:12.700
I gave you a systematic way to
get 610.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25621-0
01:59:10.860 --> 01:59:11.680
That's true, yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25633-0
01:59:12.710 --> 01:59:16.150
Now the question is, how do you
find other solutions?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25641-0
01:59:16.160 --> 01:59:21.310
Is can you now generate this
from these two?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25645-0
01:59:26.470 --> 01:59:27.510
Can you generate?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25655-0
01:59:29.580 --> 01:59:32.500
1/2 from 1:00 then 1 -, 5.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25661-0
01:59:33.820 --> 01:59:34.060
Yep.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25662-0
01:59:34.680 --> 01:59:34.840
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25663-0
01:59:34.750 --> 01:59:35.180
Home.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25694-0
01:59:39.680 --> 01:59:44.995
How do you generate so I will
again put that MU 1 * 1 zero

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25694-1
01:59:44.995 --> 01:59:49.590
plus MU two times, the second
one which is 1 -, 5.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25713-0
01:59:52.050 --> 01:59:54.670
Will be equal to 1 to correct.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25711-0
01:59:52.350 --> 01:59:53.390
Is equal to 1/2.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25718-0
01:59:55.610 --> 01:59:55.790
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25723-0
01:59:56.660 --> 01:59:57.990
So what is the solution?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25730-0
01:59:58.340 --> 01:59:59.870
You come to the second part.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25735-0
01:59:59.920 --> 02:00:00.770
So what is MU 2?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25744-0
02:00:02.040 --> 02:00:03.840
Uh minus 2 by 5.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25755-0
02:00:05.430 --> 02:00:09.350
You 2 equal to can I say minus
0.4.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25761-0
02:00:12.240 --> 02:00:12.430
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25769-0
02:00:12.850 --> 02:00:13.510
Yes, yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25778-0
02:00:12.890 --> 02:00:13.070
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25781-0
02:00:13.380 --> 02:00:13.900
Still listening?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25784-0
02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:14.230
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25776-0
02:00:14.670 --> 02:00:14.950
Agree.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25799-0
02:00:15.890 --> 02:00:21.135
Now you have new one plus MU 2
equal to 1 and you know MU 2

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25786-0
02:00:16.240 --> 02:00:16.350
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25799-1
02:00:21.135 --> 02:00:21.660
value.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25811-0
02:00:21.670 --> 02:00:23.510
So what is new one 1.4?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25815-0
02:00:23.980 --> 02:00:24.860
And you went.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25813-0
02:00:24.630 --> 02:00:24.850
And.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25819-0
02:00:25.110 --> 02:00:25.210
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25821-0
02:00:25.640 --> 02:00:25.820
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25825-0
02:00:26.130 --> 02:00:26.330
Yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25855-0
02:00:27.470 --> 02:00:35.366
So in other words, what is going
to happen is 1.4 times the first

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25855-1
02:00:35.366 --> 02:00:41.110
column C 1 +, -, 0.4 into the
second column C2.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25870-0
02:00:43.330 --> 02:00:47.160
Minus C1 into C3 is going to
give you 0, correct?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25877-0
02:00:48.930 --> 02:00:49.130
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25913-0
02:00:50.660 --> 02:00:54.766
But how did you take the equal
to 1 one by one and two like

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25889-0
02:00:51.070 --> 02:00:51.550
Yes, yes.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25913-1
02:00:54.766 --> 02:00:56.340
after the equal symbol?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25909-0
02:00:55.320 --> 02:00:56.450
That Venkat said.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25924-0
02:00:56.460 --> 02:00:58.380
We have another class starting
soon.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25918-0
02:00:58.530 --> 02:00:59.310
OK, fine.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25933-0
02:00:59.320 --> 02:01:01.810
So I will continue with this
example in next class, OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25935-0
02:01:02.870 --> 02:01:03.230
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25938-0
02:01:03.690 --> 02:01:04.320
OK.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25941-0
02:01:04.210 --> 02:01:04.660
So.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25965-0
02:01:04.420 --> 02:01:05.150
Thank you everybody.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25970-0
02:01:04.710 --> 02:01:05.990
SO11 last question.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25957-0
02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:05.430
Yes, Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25952-0

Please.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25967-0
02:01:05.460 --> 02:01:06.220
Thank you Venkat Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25962-0
02:01:06.230 --> 02:01:06.560
Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25968-0
02:01:06.570 --> 02:01:07.240
Please, please you can.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25976-0

Yeah.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/25986-0
02:01:09.290 --> 02:01:11.840
One last question is which book
we we should prefer?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/26004-0
02:01:13.070 --> 02:01:14.860
It is already given in the
handout now.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/26028-0
02:01:14.910 --> 02:01:17.390
APARNA, have you put the handout
in the MS Teams?

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/26038-0
02:01:16.850 --> 02:01:19.743
They're already posted long

So you can refer to the textbook
there only Sir.

c5f75b83-d39d-497e-935b-57f7f8779819/26101-0
02:01:26.790 --> 02:01:28.720
