00:02:10.717 --> 00:02:13.552
Saturday, we can accommodate how
much ever we want, but Sunday

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/831-1
00:02:13.552 --> 00:02:14.407
would be difficult.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/859-0
00:02:16.757 --> 00:02:20.165
Saturday, for me it will be
difficult to engage her because

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/859-1
00:02:20.165 --> 00:02:22.607
you know I'm I I have the time
limitation.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/880-0
00:02:22.777 --> 00:02:25.277
Only two hours of time I have to
take lunch also.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/892-0
00:02:26.187 --> 00:02:27.837
OK, think there is no
continuous.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/919-0
00:02:26.527 --> 00:02:29.157
But you can watch according
also, right said.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/936-0
00:02:27.847 --> 00:02:30.217
Maybe we can offline do a
polling something.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/908-0
00:02:28.077 --> 00:02:28.927
Set up like we.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/925-0
00:02:28.537 --> 00:02:29.117
Properly.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/939-0
00:02:29.137 --> 00:02:31.397
We have just two classes on
Saturday.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/924-0
00:02:29.167 --> 00:02:29.887
I think we can.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/961-0
00:02:30.737 --> 00:02:34.011
That I think we should discuss
it later, not during the

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/965-0
00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:35.607
They probably can go for voting
set.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/961-1
00:02:34.011 --> 00:02:34.537
sessions.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/972-0
00:02:34.557 --> 00:02:35.857
Yeah, we can take a poll.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/986-0
00:02:36.447 --> 00:02:38.027
Yeah, voting will be better,
yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/985-0
00:02:37.017 --> 00:02:37.847
Yeah, later. Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/992-0
00:02:37.067 --> 00:02:39.877
OK, so so so, OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/990-0
00:02:37.537 --> 00:02:39.427
Yeah, we can decide it later,
Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/995-0
00:02:40.217 --> 00:02:41.007
So let me.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/998-0
00:02:42.127 --> 00:02:42.597
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1010-0
00:02:42.607 --> 00:02:45.337
So let me give you let, let me
give you two options, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1029-0
00:02:46.567 --> 00:02:50.272
One option is that you tell me
by the end of this class you run

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1029-1
00:02:50.272 --> 00:02:50.677
a poll.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1089-0
00:02:50.687 --> 00:02:55.137
Right now in some other WhatsApp
or something like that and you

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1089-1
00:02:55.137 --> 00:02:59.448
tell me alternatively you tell
me by the end of today, one of

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1089-2
00:02:59.448 --> 00:03:03.968
you just mail me saying that we
can have the classroom this time

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1089-3
00:03:03.968 --> 00:03:08.001
to this time on Sunday, but you
can't expect me to finish

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1089-4
00:03:08.001 --> 00:03:08.627
problems.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1104-0
00:03:08.637 --> 00:03:12.371
Also finish the slides also and
make it understandable to you

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1104-1
00:03:12.371 --> 00:03:13.757
within those two hours.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1136-0
00:03:13.767 --> 00:03:16.407
The two hours has a certain
pace, but if you want me to go

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1136-1
00:03:16.407 --> 00:03:18.957
out a little slower pace, you
have to give me more time.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1151-0
00:03:19.367 --> 00:03:22.217
So Sunday, if I don't have the
right side bound.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1173-0
00:03:22.607 --> 00:03:25.334
If you want me to work out one
more problem, I can workout one

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1173-1
00:03:25.334 --> 00:03:25.897
more problem.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1211-0
00:03:27.127 --> 00:03:30.257
If you want me to do something
else, I can do something else

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1211-1
00:03:30.257 --> 00:03:33.284
also, but it should not be so
tight that you know somebody

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1211-2
00:03:33.284 --> 00:03:36.157
says here it is already 1:00
o'clock and we are hungry.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1230-0
00:03:36.597 --> 00:03:39.537
So you will break for lunch,
then the entire momentum goes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1254-0
00:03:39.967 --> 00:03:44.250
We can do even even 22 breaks
for 10 minutes for coffee, tea,

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1245-0
00:03:40.197 --> 00:03:41.647
Yes, yes, makes sense.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1254-1
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.977
hygiene, break, etcetera.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1259-0
00:03:45.987 --> 00:03:47.967
That is all accommodate able OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1274-0
00:03:50.137 --> 00:03:51.847
That Sunday, 3:00 PM is fine.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1277-0
00:03:50.337 --> 00:03:51.927
Yeah, makes sense.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1303-0
00:03:52.137 --> 00:03:54.077
Anyway, it is regarding so.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1284-0
00:03:52.177 --> 00:03:52.787
Whatever.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1293-0
00:03:52.417 --> 00:03:53.067
Makes sense.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1304-0
00:03:53.257 --> 00:03:54.507
So, so one of you.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1300-0
00:03:53.377 --> 00:03:53.877
A big.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1314-0
00:03:54.517 --> 00:03:57.147
So one of you write an email to
me with just one of you.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1328-0
00:03:57.157 --> 00:03:59.607
You did nominate yourself and
write an email to me.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1325-0
00:03:57.267 --> 00:03:57.447
Then.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1347-0
00:03:59.757 --> 00:04:01.617
I'll schedule the class and put
it in the calendar.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1344-0
00:04:01.987 --> 00:04:02.527
The gizzard.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1361-0
00:04:02.537 --> 00:04:06.457
Is it possible to have one pool
now you can initiate that pool.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1372-0
00:04:07.727 --> 00:04:08.987
We can directly see that.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1375-0
00:04:09.737 --> 00:04:10.387
Yes, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1383-0
00:04:10.437 --> 00:04:11.247
Right now it's off.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1407-0
00:04:10.677 --> 00:04:12.457
In teams, only they can do it,
Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1404-0
00:04:11.257 --> 00:04:12.417
We can get the answer now.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1419-0
00:04:12.197 --> 00:04:14.954
We can directly, you know,
instead of waiting, we can just

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1419-1
00:04:14.954 --> 00:04:16.777
one click, we will be completing
that.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1418-0
00:04:14.977 --> 00:04:15.137
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1428-0
00:04:19.617 --> 00:04:20.897
There is a small problem there.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1437-0
00:04:23.807 --> 00:04:26.727
The problem is an.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1447-0
00:04:27.057 --> 00:04:29.447
The problem is not everybody's
present in the class now.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1459-0
00:04:32.957 --> 00:04:35.787
But even by EOD, how can we be
sure?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1477-0
00:04:35.797 --> 00:04:37.557
Sure, that everyone will respond
such.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1486-0
00:04:36.797 --> 00:04:40.031
You have you have written a mail
or you have written this to all

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1486-1
00:04:40.031 --> 00:04:40.827
your classmates.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1504-0
00:04:40.837 --> 00:04:42.677
It has gone by Google forms or
something like it.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1514-0
00:04:43.817 --> 00:04:45.527
If they're not, respond to that,
then.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1521-0
00:04:45.537 --> 00:04:47.287
So tomorrow somebody should not
blame Nam.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1524-0
00:04:47.437 --> 00:04:48.227
I was.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1541-0
00:04:48.857 --> 00:04:53.985
I was in my in my office and I
did not have access to this

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1541-1
00:04:53.985 --> 00:04:54.507
stuff.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1548-0
00:04:54.717 --> 00:04:56.097
So people decide on Sunday.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1575-0
00:04:58.147 --> 00:05:01.028
Work anyways, so like if someone
doesn't join, they can always go

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1575-1
00:05:01.028 --> 00:05:02.207

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1580-0
00:05:03.027 --> 00:05:03.307
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1582-0
00:05:03.227 --> 00:05:05.277
Yeah, that's what that recording
is there.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1585-0
00:05:03.367 --> 00:05:03.817
Agree.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1619-0
00:05:04.207 --> 00:05:09.793
OK, so my point is my point is
that you people decide and you

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1596-0
00:05:05.287 --> 00:05:07.197
So anyone if you can check.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1619-1
00:05:09.793 --> 00:05:12.947
let me know I am OK with
anything.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1637-0

00:05:20.747 --> 00:05:25.113
Maybe everyone can vote and we
can know the result by the end

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1674-1
00:05:25.113 --> 00:05:29.410

00:05:34.964 --> 00:05:35.427
select.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1711-0
00:05:35.437 --> 00:05:38.337
Suggest one thing during the
break hygiene break.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1725-0
00:05:38.347 --> 00:05:42.836
We can have this pool that time
all the people will be present,

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1725-1
00:05:42.836 --> 00:05:43.257
right?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1744-0
00:05:44.597 --> 00:05:46.647
OK, OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1729-0
00:05:45.487 --> 00:05:45.857
Huh.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1752-0
00:05:45.907 --> 00:05:48.986
Then then it will be better you
know, instead of just, you know,

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1752-1
00:05:48.986 --> 00:05:49.697
uh, delegating.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1792-0
00:05:49.707 --> 00:05:53.791
And you know, keeping in the
last or something like that, we

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1792-1
00:05:53.791 --> 00:05:57.875
can have one time there here and
then we can close this out,

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1788-0
00:05:57.687 --> 00:05:58.957
You send the one mail to me.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1792-2
00:05:57.875 --> 00:05:58.277
right?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1798-0
00:05:58.967 --> 00:06:00.897
You send one of, you send one
mail to me.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1801-0
00:06:01.147 --> 00:06:01.517
That's it.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1807-0
00:06:01.527 --> 00:06:02.057
I'll finish it.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1811-0
00:06:02.697 --> 00:06:03.097
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1812-0
00:06:03.497 --> 00:06:04.397
OK. Take care.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1821-0
00:06:04.857 --> 00:06:07.137
So you are able to see my
screen.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1824-0
00:06:07.817 --> 00:06:07.997
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1835-0
00:06:09.067 --> 00:06:12.077
OK, now the concept of linear
independence dependence.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1850-0
00:06:12.227 --> 00:06:12.637
It known?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1852-0
00:06:12.647 --> 00:06:15.307
Or should I revise it a little
bit and then finish it off?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1862-0
00:06:18.297 --> 00:06:19.017
So please revise.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1858-0
00:06:18.577 --> 00:06:18.787
Umm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1879-0
00:06:19.727 --> 00:06:22.727
OK, so should I do it in my
notebook?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1874-0
00:06:19.757 --> 00:06:20.447
Otherwise it.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1880-0
00:06:21.577 --> 00:06:22.917
I have SPECIFIC question.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1897-0
00:06:24.837 --> 00:06:24.997
What?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1903-0
00:06:24.957 --> 00:06:26.747
Uh, the note.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1887-0
00:06:25.007 --> 00:06:25.477
Yeah, yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1898-0
00:06:25.257 --> 00:06:25.427
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1906-0
00:06:25.487 --> 00:06:26.807
Yes, please in the notebook.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1904-0
00:06:27.597 --> 00:06:28.067
Notebook.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1909-0
00:06:28.077 --> 00:06:28.707
OK, fine.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1921-0
00:06:29.297 --> 00:06:31.587
I hope you are taking notes of
whatever I'm writing.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1955-0
00:06:31.597 --> 00:06:34.428
Nah, I am in your posting it,
but it is better that you also

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1955-1
00:06:34.428 --> 00:06:37.212
take some little notes so that
when you write one say it'll

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1955-2
00:06:37.212 --> 00:06:38.187
things will be clear.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1966-0
00:06:38.617 --> 00:06:41.577
So this is MD S Session 3.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1970-0
00:06:45.297 --> 00:06:45.577
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/1982-0
00:06:46.477 --> 00:06:48.707
But we agree that we will not
disturb others.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2001-0
00:06:48.717 --> 00:06:51.351
If you don't have anything to
ask me, you put your system on

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2001-1
00:06:51.351 --> 00:06:51.567
mute.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2017-0
00:06:51.837 --> 00:06:54.483
If you have something to ask me,
just unmute yourself and then

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2017-1
00:06:54.483 --> 00:06:55.617
you can throw the question.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2027-0
00:06:56.337 --> 00:06:59.367
So now there are three concepts
here.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2039-0
00:06:59.417 --> 00:07:05.365
One is linear independence and
dependence, second is generating

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2039-1
00:07:05.365 --> 00:07:05.737
set.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2043-0
00:07:08.707 --> 00:07:09.287
30s.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2047-0
00:07:12.087 --> 00:07:12.627
Span.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2051-0
00:07:14.637 --> 00:07:15.117
4.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2057-0
00:07:16.757 --> 00:07:19.837
Basis and 50s dimension.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2071-0
00:07:22.217 --> 00:07:25.507
OK, so now I will come come to
the first point.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2079-0
00:07:25.467 --> 00:07:25.677
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2076-0
00:07:25.517 --> 00:07:26.257
So what is dinner?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2081-0
00:07:26.267 --> 00:07:27.147
Independence dependence.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2104-0
00:07:27.377 --> 00:07:30.694
You have a vector space V and
then you have a set of vectors

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2100-0
00:07:29.177 --> 00:07:29.337
Like.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2104-1
00:07:30.694 --> 00:07:31.347
V1 up to VN.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2143-0
00:07:31.987 --> 00:07:36.410
Now we call them as linearly
independent if any combination

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2143-1
00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:40.981
linear combination alpha 1V1
plus A2, V 2 plus all the way up

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2143-2
00:07:40.981 --> 00:07:41.497
2A NVN.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2173-0
00:07:41.807 --> 00:07:46.588
If it is equated to 0, this will
imply that A1 equal to A2 equal

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2173-1
00:07:46.588 --> 00:07:50.487
to equal to alpha N equal to 0
as the only solution.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2183-0
00:07:54.577 --> 00:07:56.657
Now this only has to be
highlighted.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2201-0
00:07:59.277 --> 00:08:03.297
Agree wherever you want an
example, you should ask me like.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2209-0
00:08:03.307 --> 00:08:05.087
Otherwise, I think that this is
all known to you.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2215-0
00:08:07.577 --> 00:08:07.877
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2233-0
00:08:09.107 --> 00:08:17.203
OK, in case if not, then we went
up to VNR linearly dependent

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2233-1
00:08:17.203 --> 00:08:17.987
agree.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2239-0
00:08:20.687 --> 00:08:20.827
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2245-0
00:08:21.547 --> 00:08:24.057
OK, fine. What?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2243-0
00:08:21.837 --> 00:08:22.077
Agree.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2244-0
00:08:22.177 --> 00:08:22.517
Please.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2257-0
00:08:26.717 --> 00:08:27.297
Agreed, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2252-0
00:08:27.887 --> 00:08:28.247
Agree.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2261-0
00:08:28.007 --> 00:08:28.677
What are they?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2264-0
00:08:28.257 --> 00:08:28.687
OK, fine.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2276-0
00:08:30.077 --> 00:08:32.589
Now the second one is there is
something called generating

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2276-1
00:08:32.589 --> 00:08:32.887
sector.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2281-0
00:08:33.177 --> 00:08:35.417
Second, now you have.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2294-0
00:08:35.477 --> 00:08:40.387
Let's say U1U2 up to UM are such
that.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2307-0
00:08:43.937 --> 00:08:47.867
Any Member V belong to V can be
written as.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2333-0
00:08:52.537 --> 00:08:59.333
Some A1 you want plus A2, U2
plus all the day up to Alpha MUM

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2333-1
00:08:59.333 --> 00:09:01.087
equal to B then.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2345-0
00:09:03.797 --> 00:09:04.707
You want up to.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2350-0
00:09:04.717 --> 00:09:06.997
UM is called the generating
center.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2356-0
00:09:12.407 --> 00:09:12.747
Agreed.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2358-0
00:09:14.147 --> 00:09:14.507
He is.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2386-0
00:09:15.917 --> 00:09:19.937
So any we can be written from
from this from this set, but you

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2386-1
00:09:19.937 --> 00:09:23.957
be linearly combine them then it
is called the generating set.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2391-0
00:09:27.887 --> 00:09:28.107
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2390-0
00:09:28.307 --> 00:09:28.567
Agree.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2393-0
00:09:29.797 --> 00:09:30.267
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2397-0
00:09:30.357 --> 00:09:33.117
Third, you find a.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2442-0
00:09:35.307 --> 00:09:42.604
That but the for the what the
span if I say we want up to be N

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2405-0
00:09:37.407 --> 00:09:37.717
But the.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2442-1
00:09:42.604 --> 00:09:49.091
then the linear span of V1 is
basically nothing but all

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2442-2
00:09:49.091 --> 00:09:50.597
combinations.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2479-0
00:09:50.607 --> 00:09:55.337
You put A1, V one plus A2, V 2
plus all the way up to alpha in

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2479-1
00:09:55.337 --> 00:09:59.767
VN where alpha belong to F this
is called the linear span.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2516-0
00:10:00.157 --> 00:10:04.187
So you can you combine them with
whatever possible combinations

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2516-1
00:10:04.187 --> 00:10:07.839
you have and this will all get
into something called as a

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2516-2
00:10:07.839 --> 00:10:08.847
linear span. OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2538-0
00:10:10.377 --> 00:10:14.117
And what is app here belongs to
FF?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2531-0
00:10:12.337 --> 00:10:12.667
What is?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2546-0
00:10:15.047 --> 00:10:17.237
If it's a field, the scalars.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2548-0
00:10:16.647 --> 00:10:16.917
Great.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2557-0
00:10:20.237 --> 00:10:21.457
That is set up scalers.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2563-0
00:10:22.307 --> 00:10:22.487
What?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2566-0
00:10:23.387 --> 00:10:24.287
Setup is scalers.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2564-0
00:10:23.477 --> 00:10:23.797
And.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2575-0
00:10:26.097 --> 00:10:27.227
This is a field of scalars.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2582-0
00:10:26.917 --> 00:10:28.657
Yeah, and.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2587-0
00:10:28.417 --> 00:10:30.927
Be one is a vector, A1 is a
scalar.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2616-0
00:10:32.487 --> 00:10:37.406
And are we saying when we say
set we mean a vector space here

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2616-1
00:10:37.406 --> 00:10:38.517
or just as it?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2614-0
00:10:37.787 --> 00:10:39.807
No, no, no.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2634-0
00:10:39.817 --> 00:10:42.377
It becomes a bit of space is a
different thing, but you put all

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2634-1
00:10:42.377 --> 00:10:43.297
these things into this.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2635-0
00:10:42.887 --> 00:10:43.127
The.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2638-0
00:10:45.147 --> 00:10:45.497
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2652-0
00:10:45.807 --> 00:10:47.797
Yeah, in this case, we're just
talking about a vector set.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2670-0
00:10:47.807 --> 00:10:49.847
We are not worried about whether
it is a vector space or not.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2675-0
00:10:50.677 --> 00:10:52.657
This is set of all vectors of
this form.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2700-0
00:10:55.487 --> 00:10:58.052
So Sir, basically we are
combining the vectors to

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2700-1
00:10:58.052 --> 00:11:01.182
generate another vector which is
also a part of the original

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2700-2
00:11:01.182 --> 00:11:01.747
vector set.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2704-0
00:11:03.977 --> 00:11:04.417
Hmm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2709-0
00:11:04.457 --> 00:11:05.587
Yes, in a vague sense.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2735-0
00:11:08.697 --> 00:11:13.041
So let me give you so should
should I give you some little

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2729-0
00:11:09.077 --> 00:11:10.137
This we went to.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2735-1
00:11:13.041 --> 00:11:14.587
understandable stuff.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2757-0
00:11:19.187 --> 00:11:19.817
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2760-0
00:11:19.227 --> 00:11:21.437
Should I give you some little
understandable stuff?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2772-0
00:11:19.377 --> 00:11:21.497
It's it's the the previous one.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2756-0
00:11:19.507 --> 00:11:19.707
Uh.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2777-0

Yes, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2785-0
00:11:23.157 --> 00:11:23.717
It's at least.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2780-0
00:11:23.667 --> 00:11:24.157
Yes, Sir.

00:11:49.867 --> 00:11:51.757
And this is my V1.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2850-0
00:11:51.767 --> 00:11:52.867
This is my V2.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2856-0
00:11:52.917 --> 00:11:54.127
This is my V3.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2862-0
00:11:54.137 --> 00:11:55.287
This is my V4.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2867-0
00:11:55.297 --> 00:11:56.707
This is my V5, agree.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2878-0

00:12:02.167 --> 00:12:06.377
Now what all I can generate is I
will take some spoons.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2906-0
00:12:06.497 --> 00:12:08.897
A1 spoons of spoons of tea
leaves.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2914-0
00:12:09.367 --> 00:12:12.987
Add it to A2 spoons of sugar.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2937-0
00:12:14.117 --> 00:12:23.307
And A3 ounces of water plus A4
ounces of milk plus A5 spoons of

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2937-1
00:12:23.307 --> 00:12:25.317
masala. Agree.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2942-0

00:12:29.227 --> 00:12:34.307
How I keep changing A1A2A3A4A5
then what will it generate?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2971-0
00:12:34.317 --> 00:12:36.687
I will generate all sorts of
things.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2977-0
00:12:36.777 --> 00:12:37.617
What will it generate?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2981-0
00:12:37.627 --> 00:12:38.037
You tell me.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3002-0
00:12:39.497 --> 00:12:43.864
Only you will generate that of
different quantity if you change

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/2993-0
00:12:40.987 --> 00:12:41.167
What?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3003-0
00:12:43.727 --> 00:12:44.367
I can generate.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3002-1
00:12:43.864 --> 00:12:44.137
the.

00:12:46.397 --> 00:12:50.293
So you can generate a tease of
different varieties, kind of

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3024-0
00:12:47.497 --> 00:12:48.447
Different types of thing.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3027-0
00:12:48.507 --> 00:12:49.757
Be different.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3067-0
00:12:49.767 --> 00:12:53.357
Variety of different quantity,
different quantity, different

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3054-1
00:12:50.293 --> 00:12:51.397
masala tea, yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3060-0
00:12:50.737 --> 00:12:52.227
It's been quantity, different
quality.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3061-0
00:12:50.777 --> 00:12:52.747
No, you, you, you, you tell me.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3068-0
00:12:52.957 --> 00:12:55.117
So for example, I can I can do.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3067-1
00:12:53.357 --> 00:12:53.887
quantity.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3073-0
00:12:55.907 --> 00:12:57.167
And I will.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3091-0
00:12:57.177 --> 00:13:00.512
I'm writing a few members of the
set and there is something

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3091-1
00:13:00.512 --> 00:13:01.457
called black tea.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3110-0
00:13:04.977 --> 00:13:09.011
I will just combine tea leaves
and water and I will take black

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3110-1
00:13:09.011 --> 00:13:09.267
tea.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3115-0
00:13:09.277 --> 00:13:10.117
Maybe without sugar.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3128-0
00:13:12.117 --> 00:13:15.387
I can take uh black tea with
sugar, correct?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3129-0
00:13:16.277 --> 00:13:16.467
Yeah.

00:13:18.687 --> 00:13:19.177
You know that?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3157-0
00:13:19.277 --> 00:13:23.847
Then I can take masala tea,
PASCOAL Arti without sugar.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3156-0
00:13:24.307 --> 00:13:24.947
To go outside.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3161-0
00:13:25.087 --> 00:13:27.467
I can do a plain milk.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3168-0
00:13:29.547 --> 00:13:29.767
Umm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3169-0
00:13:30.397 --> 00:13:31.517
I can make dilute milk.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3176-0
00:13:33.557 --> 00:13:34.707
I can make milk with sugar.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3208-0
00:13:37.487 --> 00:13:42.567
You see what all I can generate
so I need to just play around

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3208-1
00:13:42.567 --> 00:13:44.697
with the A1A2A3A4A3 agree.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3215-0
00:13:45.637 --> 00:13:45.897
Quickly.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3222-0
00:13:47.107 --> 00:13:47.427
Agree.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3223-0
00:13:47.427 --> 00:13:49.097
Now that is what you do with
vectors.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3225-0
00:13:47.717 --> 00:13:47.887
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3230-0
00:13:49.107 --> 00:13:50.617
Also you have vectors.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3262-0
00:13:50.867 --> 00:13:54.820
You can maybe take one set of
A1A2 up to alpha and you can

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3262-1
00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:58.037
take a different set of A1A2 up
to alpha north.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3315-0
00:13:58.517 --> 00:14:02.060
Now whatever it generates, so
every time you keep collecting

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3315-1
00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:05.372
these vectors, you try to
generate this and then you see

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3315-2
00:14:05.372 --> 00:14:09.031
you put all of them in a dubba
that Dubai is called the linear

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3315-3
00:14:09.031 --> 00:14:11.297
span of here V1 up to be here.
Agreed.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3324-0
00:14:14.407 --> 00:14:15.137
OK. Agree.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3339-0
00:14:15.747 --> 00:14:19.442
OK, so you will generate so many
varieties because you can have

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3339-1
00:14:19.442 --> 00:14:20.597
less sugar variante.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3350-0
00:14:20.607 --> 00:14:23.247
You can have more sugar variant
if you have more sugar.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3356-0
00:14:23.667 --> 00:14:24.877
Your A2 is more.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3360-0
00:14:28.327 --> 00:14:28.757
Umm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3369-0
00:14:29.157 --> 00:14:29.317
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3373-0
00:14:29.487 --> 00:14:31.157
And so here I work.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3380-0
00:14:30.347 --> 00:14:30.987
If, if, if.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3385-0
00:14:31.167 --> 00:14:33.077
One more thing I want to
understand here.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3388-0
00:14:31.297 --> 00:14:31.897
But yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3394-0
00:14:33.087 --> 00:14:34.797
One more thing I want to
understand Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3404-0
00:14:35.227 --> 00:14:37.907
Here is the field field means
any variety.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3416-0
00:14:37.917 --> 00:14:41.197
We can either milk or tea or
only water.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3423-0
00:14:41.447 --> 00:14:42.167
Something like that.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3424-0
00:14:42.557 --> 00:14:43.367
You everything.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3445-0
00:14:43.617 --> 00:14:49.087
Only water is only you put
A1A2A4A5 equal to zero.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3450-0
00:14:49.157 --> 00:14:50.267
That is also one possibility.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3453-0
00:14:55.157 --> 00:14:55.397
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3472-0
00:14:57.017 --> 00:14:59.886
So then what is the difference
between the generating set and

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3469-0
00:14:57.487 --> 00:14:57.757
If I.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3472-1
00:14:59.886 --> 00:15:00.117
this?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3500-0
00:15:00.127 --> 00:15:03.436
Because even in the generating
set we have vectors and the

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3500-1
00:15:03.436 --> 00:15:06.914
combination linear combinations
vector will generate one more

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3500-2
00:15:06.914 --> 00:15:07.307
vector.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3504-0
00:15:08.047 --> 00:15:08.297
Uh.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3513-0
00:15:08.307 --> 00:15:08.777
Correct.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3510-0
00:15:08.357 --> 00:15:09.447
So what is that going?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3534-0
00:15:08.907 --> 00:15:15.827
So so so I am saying this is
what this is going to be.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3515-0
00:15:09.457 --> 00:15:09.827
Yes, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3520-0
00:15:09.837 --> 00:15:10.097
What is?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3568-0
00:15:17.387 --> 00:15:22.474
No, if I if I can continue the
same example if I want to

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3568-1
00:15:22.474 --> 00:15:28.096
prepare coffee now, we may be
able to prepare coffee from this

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3568-2
00:15:28.096 --> 00:15:29.167
ingredients.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3580-0
00:15:30.947 --> 00:15:31.867
No, no.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3575-0
00:15:31.437 --> 00:15:31.617
And.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3579-0
00:15:31.477 --> 00:15:31.877
No, no.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3583-0
00:15:31.997 --> 00:15:32.677
No, no.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3601-0
00:15:33.337 --> 00:15:38.283
In the generating set, I said
any we belonging to V can be

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3601-1
00:15:38.283 --> 00:15:41.217
written as this combination
agree.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3603-0
00:15:42.777 --> 00:15:42.947
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3611-0
00:15:44.467 --> 00:15:46.047
That is what a generating set
is.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3624-0
00:15:50.217 --> 00:15:51.977
Now in this case I can.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3625-0
00:15:51.327 --> 00:15:52.097
It.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3652-0
00:15:54.327 --> 00:15:56.247
This is with the reference for
the post code.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3674-0
00:15:54.417 --> 00:15:58.691
If I have it, if I have a
generating set there, if I have

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3674-1
00:15:58.691 --> 00:16:03.334
a generating sector, then any
element in that vector space can

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3674-2
00:16:03.334 --> 00:16:06.577
be written as a linear
combination, agreed.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3683-0
00:16:09.297 --> 00:16:09.987
Yeah, I agree.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3697-0
00:16:10.697 --> 00:16:13.740
But if I have only two
ingredients, it cannot produce

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3697-1
00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:16.107
every element in my vector
space. Agreed.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3701-0
00:16:20.347 --> 00:16:20.547
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3715-0
00:16:22.067 --> 00:16:26.036
So I am talking about if I want
coffee or I want paneer butter

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3715-1
00:16:26.036 --> 00:16:26.477
masala.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3727-0
00:16:29.187 --> 00:16:31.097
I cannot make from these things
correct.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3750-0
00:16:32.397 --> 00:16:35.733
Can I make paneer butter masala
from V1V2V3V4V5 impossible,

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3747-0
00:16:33.127 --> 00:16:33.317
It's.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3750-1
00:16:35.733 --> 00:16:36.067
right?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3751-0
00:16:36.387 --> 00:16:37.007
Don't know.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3817-0
00:16:37.297 --> 00:16:37.697
Correct.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3771-0
00:16:38.867 --> 00:16:42.689
But what I can generate out of
this is something else that is

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3771-1
00:16:42.689 --> 00:16:44.107
called the linear span.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3797-0
00:16:44.557 --> 00:16:48.095
Now, if every element in this
can be generated from these

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3797-1
00:16:48.095 --> 00:16:51.267
things, then it will be called
as a generating set.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3813-0
00:16:52.017 --> 00:16:54.708
So if you go to a restaurant in
the restaurant, they have

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3813-1
00:16:54.708 --> 00:16:56.007
finitely many things, right?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3829-0
00:16:58.007 --> 00:16:58.207
And.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3836-0
00:16:59.407 --> 00:17:00.477
In the restaurant, if you.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3843-0
00:16:59.507 --> 00:17:02.827
But since then you can, Sir, can
we consider like the like?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3849-0
00:17:02.837 --> 00:17:04.737
Say we have tea leaf example.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3860-0
00:17:04.747 --> 00:17:07.097
You're given 5 to V5.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3909-0
00:17:07.427 --> 00:17:11.098
Let's say if you add coffee also
as V6, then does it that those

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3867-0
00:17:07.607 --> 00:17:07.767
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3911-0
00:17:10.567 --> 00:17:14.832
If you put it there, so I I'm
going to come to that in the

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3909-1
00:17:11.098 --> 00:17:13.507
set of vectors are called
generating set.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3911-1
00:17:14.832 --> 00:17:15.627
next point.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3926-0
00:17:18.967 --> 00:17:22.017
If you are given only two items,
so then what?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3952-0
00:17:22.027 --> 00:17:27.539
So for example, example if I
have a set where I have just a

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3952-1
00:17:27.539 --> 00:17:31.397
milk and uh sugar, what kind of
generate?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3958-0
00:17:33.277 --> 00:17:34.297
What is the linear span of this?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3961-0
00:17:37.237 --> 00:17:37.767
Milk.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3980-0
00:17:37.777 --> 00:17:39.507
Milk with sugar and milk without
sugar.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3984-0
00:17:38.667 --> 00:17:40.757
Was that with the?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3991-0
00:17:40.017 --> 00:17:45.367
So what milk without sugar and
milk with sugar correct?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/3996-0
00:17:42.657 --> 00:17:42.927
K.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4001-0
00:17:47.367 --> 00:17:48.417
Plain milk plain sugar.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4002-0
00:17:47.997 --> 00:17:48.877
Some sweet also.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4014-0
00:17:51.037 --> 00:17:52.747
The I am gently talking about
liquid.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4030-0
00:17:52.757 --> 00:17:55.599
If you just want to have one, I
mean I I want to have

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4030-1
00:17:55.599 --> 00:17:56.547
combinations here.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4043-0
00:17:56.887 --> 00:17:59.137
No, if you just want to have
sugar, you can have sugar.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4060-0
00:17:59.147 --> 00:18:02.418
Also taken now the point is
there is something called

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4060-1
00:18:02.418 --> 00:18:03.327
generating set.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4068-0
00:18:03.337 --> 00:18:05.677
The generating set is something
like.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4094-0
00:18:05.687 --> 00:18:09.330
You walk into a restaurant,
let's say you walk into a 5 star

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4094-1
00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:12.972
restaurant and then the Visa
restaurant has lots and lots of

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4094-2
00:18:12.972 --> 00:18:14.107
ingredients, right?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4106-0
00:18:16.917 --> 00:18:19.227
So let's say it has 500
ingredients.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4116-0
00:18:20.937 --> 00:18:22.717
Agree this is the first
ingredient.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4123-0
00:18:22.727 --> 00:18:24.117
This is a 500 ingredient.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4127-0
00:18:24.337 --> 00:18:25.177
What does it generate?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4139-0
00:18:28.397 --> 00:18:29.467
And number of 80s.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4169-0
00:18:30.177 --> 00:18:32.701
So you can generate everything
what is available in the

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4152-0
00:18:30.537 --> 00:18:32.187
All. All.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4157-0
00:18:30.817 --> 00:18:31.307
All.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4165-0
00:18:31.947 --> 00:18:32.887
You're very delicious.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4173-0
00:18:32.237 --> 00:18:35.347
All what is all what is there in
the menu bar correct?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4169-1
00:18:32.701 --> 00:18:33.107
industry.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4174-0
00:18:36.567 --> 00:18:36.707
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4175-0
00:18:36.627 --> 00:18:36.847
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4186-0
00:18:39.817 --> 00:18:40.507
You get my point.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4198-0
00:18:40.737 --> 00:18:42.527
OK, but yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4196-0
00:18:41.547 --> 00:18:42.117
Yes, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4226-0
00:18:42.617 --> 00:18:46.576
All what is there in the menu
card so when somebody says I

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4200-0
00:18:42.627 --> 00:18:42.787
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4226-1
00:18:46.576 --> 00:18:50.736
need paneer butter masala, what
he does is he takes something

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4226-2
00:18:50.736 --> 00:18:51.407
from here.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4231-0
00:18:51.417 --> 00:18:52.777
He can take something from here.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4244-0
00:18:52.787 --> 00:18:55.207
He can take something from here
and he can take this.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4255-0
00:18:55.297 --> 00:18:57.547
He can combine these two in some
proportions.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4257-0
00:18:57.557 --> 00:18:58.067
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4266-0
00:18:58.157 --> 00:19:00.037
And then he can prepare paneer
butter masala, correct?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4272-0
00:19:01.657 --> 00:19:01.937
Correct.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4274-0
00:19:02.287 --> 00:19:02.417
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4284-0
00:19:02.727 --> 00:19:07.224
OK, but you can't ask this
fellow to prepare your dining

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4284-1
00:19:07.224 --> 00:19:07.697
table.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4295-0
00:19:10.247 --> 00:19:10.457
Correct.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4297-0
00:19:10.657 --> 00:19:12.397
And they will not be the
generating sector.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4331-0
00:19:12.407 --> 00:19:16.205
So whatever ingredients are
there in in the kitchen, he'll

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4331-1
00:19:16.205 --> 00:19:20.324
be able to generate the dishes
which are there only in the menu

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4331-2
00:19:20.324 --> 00:19:22.127
card, outside the menu card.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4339-0
00:19:22.137 --> 00:19:23.647
He will not commit anything,
correct.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4358-0
00:19:24.757 --> 00:19:26.247
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4355-0
00:19:25.947 --> 00:19:26.167
Yep.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4349-0
00:19:25.957 --> 00:19:26.057
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4382-0
00:19:26.207 --> 00:19:29.520
That is what I'm saying, but the
linear span is different and the

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4351-0
00:19:26.637 --> 00:19:27.157
Sounds.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4375-0
00:19:27.957 --> 00:19:28.777
That so the minute.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4419-0
00:19:28.357 --> 00:19:28.567
I.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4382-1
00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.377
and the general is a generating
set.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4389-0
00:19:31.387 --> 00:19:34.337
Is something like you give me
any item?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4400-0
00:19:34.627 --> 00:19:37.287
I will be able to generate with
a set of items.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4408-0
00:19:38.987 --> 00:19:40.477
Live near Spanish.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4430-0
00:19:40.487 --> 00:19:43.624
You play around with the set of
items, it may not generate

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4430-1
00:19:43.624 --> 00:19:44.847
everything it generate.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4434-0
00:19:43.887 --> 00:19:44.457
So the.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4437-0
00:19:44.857 --> 00:19:46.087
Something's only agree.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4460-0
00:19:47.127 --> 00:19:50.727
So the agree this linear span of
the generating set will be the

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4460-1
00:19:50.727 --> 00:19:52.977
vector space is what we are
saying the.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4473-0
00:19:54.887 --> 00:19:56.697
But maybe can we assume this
way?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4490-0
00:19:56.707 --> 00:20:00.737
Sir, let's say vector space is a
whole and and then generate.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4515-0
00:20:00.747 --> 00:20:05.140
This setting is it is for the
whole vector space and then

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4515-1
00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:09.837
these small span is only a small
subset of that vector space.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4520-0
00:20:12.817 --> 00:20:12.977
Hello.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4525-0
00:20:13.047 --> 00:20:13.187
Well.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4530-0
00:20:13.057 --> 00:20:13.217
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4543-0
00:20:14.497 --> 00:20:15.287
Can you hear us, Sir?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4574-0
00:20:15.327 --> 00:20:18.805
I think I lost you guys for a
minute or so, so that is the

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4574-1
00:20:18.805 --> 00:20:22.047
difference between generating
set and the linear path.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4549-0
00:20:19.287 --> 00:20:19.637
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4567-0
00:20:19.647 --> 00:20:20.267
So it is saying with.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4590-0
00:20:23.017 --> 00:20:25.899
But we can we say that the
linear span of the generating

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4590-1
00:20:25.899 --> 00:20:27.467
set is the vector space itself.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4594-0
00:20:27.537 --> 00:20:28.057
Can we say that?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4595-0
00:20:29.197 --> 00:20:29.337
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4612-0
00:20:31.397 --> 00:20:31.937
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4608-0
00:20:31.587 --> 00:20:33.137
Yeah, you can say that.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4616-0
00:20:33.147 --> 00:20:34.117
I'm going to come to that now.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4630-0
00:20:35.687 --> 00:20:38.597
So one more question before we
move on linear independence.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4634-0
00:20:38.297 --> 00:20:38.457
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4676-0
00:20:38.607 --> 00:20:42.227
Just one question, very small
question this there in like I

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4647-0
00:20:41.017 --> 00:20:41.197
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4676-1
00:20:42.227 --> 00:20:45.787
just want to confirm this, the
system, the linear equation

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4676-2
00:20:45.787 --> 00:20:49.347
system represented by two
equations X + y + Z equal to One

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4676-3
00:20:49.347 --> 00:20:51.157
X + y + Z equal to four right?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4694-0
00:20:51.447 --> 00:20:53.527
Is this system linearly
independent or dependent?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4702-0
00:20:52.087 --> 00:20:55.457
One X + y + Z E equal to four
uh.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4707-0
00:20:55.997 --> 00:20:58.897
Or is this linearly independent
system or dependent system?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4727-0
00:21:01.167 --> 00:21:03.913
There is nothing like you near
independence and dependence of

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4727-1
00:21:03.913 --> 00:21:04.267
systems.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4735-0
00:21:04.307 --> 00:21:06.317
Linear independence is only for
vectors.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4738-0
00:21:08.187 --> 00:21:08.477
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4746-0
00:21:08.897 --> 00:21:11.117
So, OK, one one small question
there.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4786-0
00:21:11.267 --> 00:21:15.994
So generally like what I've been
reading this if system if a set

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4786-1
00:21:15.994 --> 00:21:19.921
of vectors is linearly
independent then a system this

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4775-0
00:21:17.977 --> 00:21:18.177
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4786-2
00:21:19.921 --> 00:21:23.557
is corresponding system will be
consistent right?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4792-0
00:21:24.107 --> 00:21:24.897
So that is.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4795-0
00:21:24.477 --> 00:21:24.807
Penny.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4818-0
00:21:25.127 --> 00:21:29.740
Is that true to a linearly sorry
linearly dependent system of

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4818-1
00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:33.907
vectors is consistent with
something I read everywhere?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4834-0
00:21:33.917 --> 00:21:37.657
Basically, but you know, like
this example, it's not so right.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4846-0
00:21:38.147 --> 00:21:40.988
These two vectors are linearly
dependent, but the system itself

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4846-1
00:21:40.988 --> 00:21:41.787
is not consistent.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4850-0
00:21:44.297 --> 00:21:44.567
No.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4864-0
00:21:44.577 --> 00:21:47.197
What is the system you are
talking about?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4867-0
00:21:47.207 --> 00:21:48.037
Systems in India.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4872-0
00:21:48.047 --> 00:21:48.497
Independence.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4884-0
00:21:48.507 --> 00:21:49.897
You're mixing A22 minute terms.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4917-0
00:21:49.937 --> 00:21:55.732
Terms that what I'm saying is,
suppose you have alpha 1 * 1

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4917-1
00:21:55.732 --> 00:22:01.721
vector, I will call it as X1 X
2X1X is 1 vector plus A2 times

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4917-2
00:22:01.721 --> 00:22:02.977
other vector.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4931-0
00:22:03.147 --> 00:22:08.517
I'll call X3X4 plus A3 times and
X.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4942-0
00:22:10.057 --> 00:22:13.467
Suppose this is equal to X7X A.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4946-0
00:22:14.807 --> 00:22:15.037
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4949-0
00:22:16.277 --> 00:22:16.447
No.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4979-0
00:22:18.097 --> 00:22:28.761
Now this will have a solution
only when only when X1X2 taxi

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4955-0
00:22:18.557 --> 00:22:18.717
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4979-1
00:22:28.761 --> 00:22:33.027
export X by X6 and X7X8.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4985-0
00:22:35.217 --> 00:22:36.367
Are linearly dependent.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4987-0
00:22:39.937 --> 00:22:40.297
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4990-0
00:22:42.077 --> 00:22:42.347
So.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/4998-0
00:22:42.717 --> 00:22:43.097
So.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5013-0
00:22:44.117 --> 00:22:46.960
You will be able to write one of
them as a linear combination of

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5013-1
00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:47.747
the others. Agree.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5021-0
00:22:49.777 --> 00:22:50.077
Agreed.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5024-0
00:22:51.277 --> 00:22:52.267
Now that is what is required.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5028-0
00:22:53.897 --> 00:22:54.327
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5037-0
00:22:54.377 --> 00:22:55.247
So, OK, fine.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5056-0
00:22:54.767 --> 00:22:58.241
In just the in case they are
linearly independent, they do

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5047-0
00:22:55.257 --> 00:22:55.927
Let me reprint.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5056-1
00:22:58.241 --> 00:22:59.537
not have any solution.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5063-0
00:23:00.807 --> 00:23:02.357
OK, I just got it.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5105-0
00:23:02.367 --> 00:23:07.179
So just let me rephrase the
question for a a system AX equal

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5105-1
00:23:07.179 --> 00:23:12.148
to B if the vectors in the in a
right the column vectors in a,

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5088-0
00:23:07.397 --> 00:23:07.667
Hmm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5105-2
00:23:12.148 --> 00:23:14.357
they are linearly dependent.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5128-0
00:23:14.747 --> 00:23:17.588
It is possible that for some
values of B, the system will

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5128-1
00:23:17.588 --> 00:23:20.577
still be inconsistent, although
the vectors are independent.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5136-0
00:23:20.587 --> 00:23:21.327
Basically right.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5150-0
00:23:22.917 --> 00:23:27.010
The yeah, I want to hear now
event to Anor linearly

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5142-0
00:23:22.987 --> 00:23:24.687
And not really.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5150-1
00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:27.797
dependent.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5162-0
00:23:27.887 --> 00:23:28.987
Suppose then.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5157-0
00:23:28.657 --> 00:23:29.507
No, no, I.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5182-0
00:23:29.547 --> 00:23:33.683
No, no, I I I am not saying A1
to a in a linearly independent

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5182-1
00:23:33.683 --> 00:23:34.617
A1 to A1 line.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5196-0
00:23:34.627 --> 00:23:36.807
The independent and it does end
by end square matrix.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5212-0
00:23:37.767 --> 00:23:38.937
Then it allow units solution.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5218-0
00:23:40.077 --> 00:23:42.297
Right I they're literally
dependent.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5231-0
00:23:40.337 --> 00:23:47.597
You give me one after a NR
linearly independent then.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5229-0
00:23:43.337 --> 00:23:44.187
Suppose there Live.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5248-0
00:23:50.477 --> 00:23:53.877
X equal to B, where A is a N
cross and matrix.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5255-0
00:23:55.607 --> 00:23:58.137
We'll have and you need to
solution.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5256-0
00:23:57.917 --> 00:23:58.067
What?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5260-0
00:24:03.547 --> 00:24:03.807
Agree.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5263-0
00:24:05.017 --> 00:24:05.377
Agreed.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5266-0
00:24:05.817 --> 00:24:06.387
OK. Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5267-0
00:24:06.077 --> 00:24:06.357
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5285-0
00:24:08.627 --> 00:24:11.971
If they're linearly dependent,
we can't comment on any X equal

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5285-1
00:24:11.971 --> 00:24:12.237
to B.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5297-0
00:24:12.247 --> 00:24:13.537
We we can't conclude anything.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5309-0
00:24:13.547 --> 00:24:14.557
It depends, right?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5306-0
00:24:13.867 --> 00:24:14.427
In not.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5310-0
00:24:14.467 --> 00:24:15.887
You're gonna need it. Suppose.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5321-0
00:24:17.677 --> 00:24:21.177
Yes, you will have infinitely
many solutions.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5331-0
00:24:25.697 --> 00:24:27.037
Ohh no solution. Also right?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5358-0
00:24:27.047 --> 00:24:31.357
That's the example I gave X + 5
plus equal to One X + y + Z

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5358-1
00:24:31.357 --> 00:24:32.147
equal to 4.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5369-0
00:24:32.157 --> 00:24:36.631
The vectors themselves are
dependent, but there is no

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5369-1
00:24:36.631 --> 00:24:37.377
solution.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5381-0
00:24:38.107 --> 00:24:40.717
No, the point is here it is
inconsistent, right?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5391-0
00:24:42.097 --> 00:24:43.107
It is inconsistent.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5398-0
00:24:43.167 --> 00:24:44.667
I have talked about consistent
systems only.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5404-0
00:24:45.827 --> 00:24:46.607
Only consisted.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5411-0
00:24:46.817 --> 00:24:47.987
I have talking about 30.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5417-0
00:24:46.907 --> 00:24:47.817
OK, fine, but this.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5449-0
00:24:47.997 --> 00:24:54.296
If you're talking about this
1114, then if you do, R2 goes to

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5449-1
00:24:54.296 --> 00:24:58.767
R 2 -, R one, you will get A1111
and A0003.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5488-0
00:25:00.317 --> 00:25:00.487
That.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5466-0
00:25:01.427 --> 00:25:06.337
Now rank of gay will be equal to
three, but rank of yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5473-0
00:25:06.347 --> 00:25:08.097
But B will be equal to four.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5478-0
00:25:08.647 --> 00:25:10.007
Therefore, this is inconsistent.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5494-0
00:25:13.257 --> 00:25:15.047
How inclusive systems will have
no solutions.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5497-0
00:25:16.407 --> 00:25:16.917
That's right.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5516-0
00:25:17.227 --> 00:25:20.827
But the call the column vectors
of a in this case are dependent

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5516-1
00:25:20.827 --> 00:25:21.727
actually, right?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5523-0
00:25:21.217 --> 00:25:21.977
Yeah, dependent.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5528-0
00:25:21.737 --> 00:25:24.417
But but the OK that was my
question.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5542-0
00:25:24.427 --> 00:25:25.807
Yeah, this possibility is.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5532-0
00:25:24.747 --> 00:25:25.267
Huh.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5548-0
00:25:25.307 --> 00:25:28.837
Now the point is I, you know, we
already I I thought we were.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5564-0
00:25:28.887 --> 00:25:31.117
We were using the theorem which
we did in the last class.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5585-0
00:25:31.527 --> 00:25:34.765
Your system of linear equations
can either have a unique

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5585-1
00:25:34.765 --> 00:25:37.719
solution, no solution, or
infinitely many solutions

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5585-2
00:25:37.719 --> 00:25:38.117
agreed.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5609-0
00:25:39.487 --> 00:25:42.707
Yeah, yeah, I got it said, I
think I think the mobile.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5614-0
00:25:40.697 --> 00:25:44.447
Now, uh, so I am not talking
about inconsistency at all.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5622-0
00:25:44.457 --> 00:25:46.287
If it is inconsistent, there is
no solution.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5656-0
00:25:46.297 --> 00:25:49.788
I mean, then we throw it away
directly in case it resolution

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5656-1
00:25:49.788 --> 00:25:53.164
and you find something like
having linear dependence, then

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5656-2
00:25:53.164 --> 00:25:55.797
you'll have infinitely many
solutions. Agree.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5658-0
00:25:57.307 --> 00:25:57.657
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5662-0
00:25:57.667 --> 00:25:58.087
Got it. Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5663-0
00:25:58.567 --> 00:25:59.147
OK, fine.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5667-0
00:26:02.007 --> 00:26:02.497
Sure.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5678-0
00:26:02.867 --> 00:26:08.417
Now the 4th point, if you have
the generating set.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5683-0
00:26:12.407 --> 00:26:13.507
That that is.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5687-0
00:26:15.177 --> 00:26:16.157
Linearly independent.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5697-0
00:26:19.637 --> 00:26:22.107
Then it is called the basis.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5709-0
00:26:27.747 --> 00:26:33.047
OK alternate thing is B1 up to
BN.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5716-0
00:26:34.727 --> 00:26:36.017
He's a basis of we.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5718-0
00:26:37.847 --> 00:26:38.057
If.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5729-0
00:26:40.707 --> 00:26:44.497
We went up to VN are linearly
independent and.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5742-0
00:26:47.147 --> 00:26:50.777
Linear span of V1 up to VN equal
to be.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5744-0
00:26:53.327 --> 00:26:53.587
Agree.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5757-0
00:27:00.237 --> 00:27:02.987
Now I just want to give you some
examples.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5777-0
00:27:03.217 --> 00:27:10.527
If you see for example 1001 and
two three now you tell me.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5783-0
00:27:10.537 --> 00:27:11.987
I consider these three elements.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5788-0
00:27:12.397 --> 00:27:13.107
Now you tell me.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5796-0
00:27:13.117 --> 00:27:16.297
Any point in R2 you tell me any
point?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5804-0
00:27:19.967 --> 00:27:21.067
2142.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5809-0
00:27:21.937 --> 00:27:22.107
What?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5815-0
00:27:22.707 --> 00:27:24.827
The in the 3131.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5827-0
00:27:25.527 --> 00:27:28.357
P1 Now I write this as 3 * 1
zero.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5841-0
00:27:29.317 --> 00:27:32.317
That's one times zero 1 + 0 * 2
three.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5847-0
00:27:33.537 --> 00:27:34.567
I've been able to write it.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5851-0
00:27:36.017 --> 00:27:36.907
It's a linear combination.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5855-0
00:27:41.987 --> 00:27:42.147
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5886-0
00:27:43.127 --> 00:27:49.124
OK, so if you give me any point
AB, I will write as 8 * 1 zero

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5863-0
00:27:43.547 --> 00:27:43.697
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5886-1
00:27:49.124 --> 00:27:53.217
plus B times zero 1 + 0 * 2
three correct?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5891-0
00:27:55.077 --> 00:27:55.237
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5914-0
00:27:56.467 --> 00:28:00.699
So the entire the R2 can be
generated from these three

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5914-1
00:28:00.699 --> 00:28:03.777
things, but now will it become a
basis?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5939-0
00:28:03.787 --> 00:28:08.062
No, because why there's two or
three itself can be written as 2

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5939-1
00:28:08.062 --> 00:28:10.667
* 1 zero plus three times 01,
correct.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5948-0
00:28:14.517 --> 00:28:14.657
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5953-0
00:28:14.777 --> 00:28:15.107
Great.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5954-0
00:28:14.977 --> 00:28:15.197
About.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5962-0
00:28:15.667 --> 00:28:18.885
So this generating set is your
over killing the generating

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5962-1
00:28:18.885 --> 00:28:19.267
sector.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5976-0
00:28:19.277 --> 00:28:23.417
But what can actually generate
is 10 comma 01.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5988-0
00:28:24.987 --> 00:28:28.968
This is good enough for it to
generate the entire arc to

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5988-1
00:28:28.968 --> 00:28:29.527
correct.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5997-0
00:28:32.927 --> 00:28:33.187
Agree.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/5998-0
00:28:33.197 --> 00:28:33.957
You help me with me?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6002-0
00:28:34.867 --> 00:28:35.107
Here.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6006-0
00:28:36.507 --> 00:28:37.087
He uses.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6015-0
00:28:38.007 --> 00:28:40.077
OK, so this is the Funda.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6038-0
00:28:40.127 --> 00:28:42.678
So from generating set
generating set can have more

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6038-1
00:28:42.678 --> 00:28:45.623
elements you cut down so that
all the elements are linearly

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6038-2
00:28:45.623 --> 00:28:46.457
independent here.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6045-0
00:28:46.467 --> 00:28:47.437
Then you'll get a basis.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6055-0
00:28:47.847 --> 00:28:50.637
Alternatively, you start with
any nonzero element.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6060-0
00:28:52.767 --> 00:28:53.077
A plus.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6069-0
00:28:53.087 --> 00:28:55.177
I want to find a basis for R2.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6081-0
00:28:55.227 --> 00:28:56.897
I start with any nonzero
element.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6087-0
00:28:56.907 --> 00:28:58.237
Let's say I start with two
three.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6107-0
00:29:01.987 --> 00:29:06.699
I will check whether I can
generate all the elements in in

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6107-1
00:29:06.699 --> 00:29:07.737
R2 using 2-3.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6118-0
00:29:08.127 --> 00:29:10.037
Can you generate every element
using 2-3 alone?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6127-0
00:29:11.027 --> 00:29:11.217
No.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6135-0
00:29:12.447 --> 00:29:13.947
You give an example which you
cannot generate.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6133-0
00:29:12.687 --> 00:29:12.937
You know.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6134-0
00:29:13.837 --> 00:29:13.997
No.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6155-0
00:29:18.367 --> 00:29:19.667
Five you cannot generate.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6162-0
00:29:18.797 --> 00:29:20.467
You what?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6147-0
00:29:19.157 --> 00:29:19.777
Both.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6167-0
00:29:19.857 --> 00:29:22.207
Both both 4/4.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6171-0
00:29:20.337 --> 00:29:22.327
Fighting and what, 57?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6183-0
00:29:22.477 --> 00:29:25.027
474447.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6190-0
00:29:24.007 --> 00:29:27.617
1 foot 1/4 cannot be generated
on 2/3.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6196-0
00:29:28.687 --> 00:29:28.827
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6205-0
00:29:29.527 --> 00:29:31.387
OK, so you please add 1/4 to
this.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6221-0
00:29:32.597 --> 00:29:36.267
Now check whether you can
generate every element in R2.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6224-0
00:29:36.277 --> 00:29:40.127
From these two you will be able
to correct.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6232-0
00:29:44.957 --> 00:29:46.167
Yeah, yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6238-0
00:29:46.527 --> 00:29:49.317
That means this becomes linearly
independent.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6252-0
00:29:49.327 --> 00:29:52.003
These two are linearly
independent and these two span

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6252-1
00:29:52.003 --> 00:29:52.697
the entire R2.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6257-0
00:29:52.707 --> 00:29:53.687
So this becomes a basis.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6263-0
00:29:57.887 --> 00:29:58.777
This is Frank.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6272-0
00:30:00.057 --> 00:30:02.047
This is also a basis for R2.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6303-0
00:30:02.277 --> 00:30:05.645
Now you can see that the number
of bases can be infinite, but

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6303-1
00:30:05.645 --> 00:30:09.121
the dimension which is basically
the number of elements will be

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6303-2
00:30:09.121 --> 00:30:09.447
fixed.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6317-0
00:30:09.717 --> 00:30:12.887
So dimension of this is 2
because number of elements is 2.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6323-0
00:30:13.097 --> 00:30:14.847
Dimension of this is also
agreed.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6330-0
00:30:15.787 --> 00:30:18.047
Now I can also write another
basis.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6342-0
00:30:19.777 --> 00:30:23.107
Uh 37422.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6346-0
00:30:23.217 --> 00:30:24.267
This is also basics.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6358-0
00:30:28.157 --> 00:30:31.327
But number of elements will be
just to agree.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6366-0
00:30:37.147 --> 00:30:37.327
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6381-0
00:30:37.717 --> 00:30:40.537
How this is also business like
this, this.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6380-0
00:30:40.007 --> 00:30:40.277
No.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6383-0
00:30:40.077 --> 00:30:41.847
You tell me any element, I'll
generate it.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6384-0
00:30:41.977 --> 00:30:42.477
7000.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6395-0
00:30:44.697 --> 00:30:47.277
Uh, I like 10/10/12.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6401-0
00:30:47.957 --> 00:30:49.867
OK, you want to generate 1012?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6429-0
00:30:50.137 --> 00:30:54.693
I will say this is nothing but
alpha times 37 plus beta times

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6415-0
00:30:50.227 --> 00:30:50.437
Umm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6438-0
00:30:54.557 --> 00:30:56.187
14 to two, OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6429-1
00:30:54.693 --> 00:30:54.987
422.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6439-0
00:30:54.997 --> 00:30:55.227
Correct.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6483-0
00:30:56.877 --> 00:31:04.508
But 3A plus 4 beta equal to 10
and 7A plus 22 beta equal to 12

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6444-0
00:30:56.897 --> 00:30:57.177
Correct.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6492-0
00:31:01.397 --> 00:31:06.377
7 revolve Plus 2218 required to
12 yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6478-0
00:31:02.907 --> 00:31:04.087
Pro plus 22.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6483-1
00:31:04.508 --> 00:31:05.477
correct?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6488-0
00:31:06.057 --> 00:31:06.227
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6518-0
00:31:06.937 --> 00:31:13.167
So can you not write this as
three 4722A beta equal to 1012?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6511-0
00:31:10.997 --> 00:31:11.527
Intel.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6520-0
00:31:12.107 --> 00:31:14.317
And 10:12 yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6525-0
00:31:13.967 --> 00:31:14.347
Uh, yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6528-0
00:31:14.887 --> 00:31:15.107
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6554-0
00:31:15.737 --> 00:31:21.527
He's invertible 66 -, 28 liter
minute which is non zero.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6566-0
00:31:20.167 --> 00:31:23.307
Then yeah. OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6589-0
00:31:21.917 --> 00:31:25.496
Therefore, alpha beta equal to
if I call this matrix as yeah,

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6558-0
00:31:21.967 --> 00:31:22.437
Hmm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6576-0
00:31:24.297 --> 00:31:24.487
That's.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6589-1
00:31:25.496 --> 00:31:28.267
it is nothing but a inverse into
1012, correct?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6590-0
00:31:27.887 --> 00:31:28.167
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6606-0
00:31:29.657 --> 00:31:31.077
In version 210 to.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6614-0
00:31:30.677 --> 00:31:31.857
So I'll get the alpha and beta.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6616-0
00:31:32.867 --> 00:31:33.527
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6627-0
00:31:33.087 --> 00:31:35.177
In this in this.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6625-0
00:31:33.667 --> 00:31:34.697
Yeah. Two questions.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6638-0
00:31:34.707 --> 00:31:35.937
Two. Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6643-0
00:31:35.187 --> 00:31:36.707
OK, OK, in.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6653-0
00:31:35.997 --> 00:31:39.007
So you give me any element, I
will be able to generate it with

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6653-1
00:31:39.007 --> 00:31:39.867
these two vectors.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6669-0
00:31:40.097 --> 00:31:43.367
So what I have told you is you
you can do two things.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6671-0
00:31:42.987 --> 00:31:43.167
That.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6698-0
00:31:43.977 --> 00:31:48.370
One is you start with a very big
set and start, uh, cutting down

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6698-1
00:31:48.370 --> 00:31:52.223
members so that it becomes
demailly independent from the

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6698-2
00:31:52.223 --> 00:31:53.237
generating set.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6723-0
00:31:53.247 --> 00:31:56.585
At the same time, generating and
then you'll end up with the

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6723-1
00:31:56.585 --> 00:31:59.047
basis or you start with the
nonzero element.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6736-0
00:31:59.057 --> 00:32:03.271
You start adding elements to the
set till the linear span of

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6736-1
00:32:03.271 --> 00:32:03.617
that.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6751-0
00:32:04.877 --> 00:32:07.422
Here's the entire vector space
and you'll be able to do it.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6751-1
00:32:07.422 --> 00:32:07.677
Agree.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6792-0
00:32:10.027 --> 00:32:13.801
Does this also mean that any two
linearly independent vectors

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6767-0
00:32:10.947 --> 00:32:11.137
It's.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6780-0
00:32:13.327 --> 00:32:13.577
Nothing.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6792-1
00:32:13.801 --> 00:32:16.297
will be able to generate R2,
right? Any.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6785-0
00:32:15.747 --> 00:32:16.217
Yeah, correct.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6787-0
00:32:16.227 --> 00:32:16.777
Exactly.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6798-0
00:32:17.027 --> 00:32:18.537
Yeah, because the dimension is
too.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6804-0
00:32:18.547 --> 00:32:20.197
Not R2's dimension is 2.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6822-0
00:32:20.587 --> 00:32:23.830
You will be able to do that any
two linearly independent vectors

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6822-1
00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:25.127
will be able to span this.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6826-0
00:32:29.857 --> 00:32:30.117
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6837-0
00:32:34.047 --> 00:32:35.497
Then I I'm sorry.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6844-0
00:32:35.187 --> 00:32:35.367
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6856-0
00:32:35.507 --> 00:32:40.577
I I if I'm asking where in you
know bad question.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6862-0
00:32:40.627 --> 00:32:42.517
R2 is what R2 I'm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6873-0
00:32:42.527 --> 00:32:43.427
I'm just trying to.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6887-0
00:32:42.737 --> 00:32:46.587
The set of all set of all two
dimensional points that is R2.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6894-0
00:32:46.417 --> 00:32:48.227
OK, OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6885-0
00:32:47.327 --> 00:32:47.577
Are you?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6912-0
00:32:47.737 --> 00:32:51.277
I don't say that you only 91.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6910-0
00:32:49.097 --> 00:32:51.717
So that means A2 dimensional
array sort of thing, right?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6977-0
00:32:52.117 --> 00:32:56.117
Two dimensional matrix. Umm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6914-0
00:32:52.167 --> 00:32:52.427
Hmm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6918-0
00:32:54.267 --> 00:32:54.547
Correct.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6920-0
00:32:57.717 --> 00:32:57.857
So.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6926-0
00:33:00.587 --> 00:33:00.987
Is it clear?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6948-0
00:33:02.617 --> 00:33:05.813
So, Sir, when you say inverse
10-12, how can we regenerate

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6948-1
00:33:05.813 --> 00:33:07.817
this using this inverse 1012 I
mean.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6961-0
00:33:09.987 --> 00:33:13.917
You can find a inverse
multiplayer 1012.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6969-0
00:33:13.927 --> 00:33:14.927
You'll get alpha and beta.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6972-0
00:33:15.107 --> 00:33:15.647
Very wrong.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6973-0
00:33:16.267 --> 00:33:16.717
Hmm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7018-0
00:33:17.247 --> 00:33:20.863
Hmm, yeah, that, that that value
of a, if you're going to make it

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6988-0
00:33:18.547 --> 00:33:18.787
Ugly.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6990-0
00:33:18.597 --> 00:33:18.997
Well.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/6989-0
00:33:18.747 --> 00:33:19.087
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7018-1
00:33:20.863 --> 00:33:23.877
inverse and multiply with 10
till probably we can get.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7010-0
00:33:23.587 --> 00:33:23.817
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7013-0
00:33:23.827 --> 00:33:24.077
Correct.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7020-0
00:33:24.087 --> 00:33:25.297
Then you will get alpha beta.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7021-0
00:33:26.027 --> 00:33:26.247
Umm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7031-0
00:33:28.467 --> 00:33:28.727
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7048-0
00:33:28.697 --> 00:33:31.147
So a inverse nothing but
transposing the things, right

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7048-1
00:33:31.147 --> 00:33:31.637
Venkat Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7051-0
00:33:31.597 --> 00:33:32.807
Why transpose inverse not?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7062-0
00:33:32.817 --> 00:33:35.557
Why transpose only for
orthogonal matrix?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7072-0
00:33:33.567 --> 00:33:36.107
Inverse OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7074-0
00:33:35.567 --> 00:33:37.761
Transpose and inverse are same,
otherwise you have to inverse

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7074-1
00:33:37.761 --> 00:33:37.867
it.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7079-0
00:33:38.347 --> 00:33:38.677
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7086-0
00:33:39.927 --> 00:33:41.777
Yeah, it's equal to B.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7097-0
00:33:42.127 --> 00:33:45.877
Now you multiply both sides by a
inverse the inverse B.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7112-0
00:33:46.147 --> 00:33:48.497
This is nothing but I X equal to
a inverse.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7123-0
00:33:48.507 --> 00:33:50.787
BIX is nothing but X, which is
equal to a inverse.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7128-0
00:33:51.917 --> 00:33:54.287
Agree chicken.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7127-0
00:33:52.697 --> 00:33:53.077
Yeah, yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7139-0
00:33:55.667 --> 00:33:57.577
So I have told you something.
Linear independence.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7142-0
00:33:57.827 --> 00:33:58.317
Dependence.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7158-0
00:33:58.327 --> 00:34:01.076
Then I've told you generating
said the linear span basis and

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7158-1
00:34:01.076 --> 00:34:01.797
dimension agree.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7164-0
00:34:03.267 --> 00:34:04.387
Have you forgotten something?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7169-0
00:34:05.427 --> 00:34:06.197
Don't think so.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7173-0
00:34:06.207 --> 00:34:07.227
But anyway let me check.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7187-0
00:34:09.747 --> 00:34:12.117
Then kisser this nodes where you
are keeping.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7189-0
00:34:10.667 --> 00:34:10.847
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7194-0
00:34:12.127 --> 00:34:13.037
I'm I'm very much sorry.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7199-0
00:34:13.047 --> 00:34:14.177
I tried to find it out.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7222-0
00:34:14.187 --> 00:34:16.907
I'm not getting this notes this
type of note.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7230-0
00:34:16.357 --> 00:34:19.963
That is the easy see finding
notes is the easiest part of my

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7230-1
00:34:19.963 --> 00:34:20.377
course.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7245-0
00:34:22.907 --> 00:34:23.917
I'm seeing in models.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7260-0
00:34:23.007 --> 00:34:27.587
You go to this place, you go to
this place in teams.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7253-0
00:34:26.587 --> 00:34:28.517
In. Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7256-0
00:34:28.527 --> 00:34:28.757
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7261-0
00:34:28.767 --> 00:34:29.197
Is there?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7264-0
00:34:29.207 --> 00:34:29.417
I'm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7281-0
00:34:29.427 --> 00:34:30.667
I'm I'm seeing this only.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7274-0
00:34:29.447 --> 00:34:30.957
OK, you find you.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7287-0
00:34:30.967 --> 00:34:32.137
You go to find Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7286-0
00:34:32.517 --> 00:34:32.757
Umm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7289-0
00:34:33.567 --> 00:34:34.457
I'm fine.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7296-0
00:34:34.467 --> 00:34:36.107
So you have this not.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7310-0
00:34:37.667 --> 00:34:40.777
Class materials, but I'm not
able to see him just saying.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7334-0
00:34:41.817 --> 00:34:44.737
Why it should be visible to
everybody, Bubba.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7336-0
00:34:45.627 --> 00:34:46.397
It's a PDF.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7360-0
00:34:45.757 --> 00:34:48.887
It is the MFDS PDF file PDF
files.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7354-0
00:34:46.407 --> 00:34:47.667
I think he's asking about notes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7359-0
00:34:48.547 --> 00:34:49.477
Yeah, it's a video file.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7362-0
00:34:49.967 --> 00:34:50.797
OK, OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7376-0
00:34:50.807 --> 00:34:54.207
OK, I thought something
different this I OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7370-0
00:34:51.827 --> 00:34:52.077
Right.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7380-0
00:34:54.217 --> 00:34:55.027
Yeah, it's there.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7383-0
00:34:55.487 --> 00:34:55.817
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7385-0
00:34:55.517 --> 00:34:55.707
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7394-0
00:34:56.427 --> 00:34:56.947
OK, fine.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7388-0
00:34:56.497 --> 00:34:56.887
Thank you.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7391-0
00:34:56.897 --> 00:34:57.417
Thank you.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7399-0
00:34:57.427 --> 00:34:57.717
That, yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7401-0
00:34:57.847 --> 00:34:58.387
OK, fine.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7416-0
00:34:59.197 --> 00:35:03.057
But this is what I had to cover
in uh session Lecture 2.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7421-0
00:35:03.927 --> 00:35:06.347
Umm, so we have given some.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7433-0
00:35:09.357 --> 00:35:11.507
So for example, this is not a
basis scanning.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7442-0
00:35:11.517 --> 00:35:13.687
Somebody tell me why why this is
not a basis?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7465-0
00:35:19.547 --> 00:35:21.187
The 2nd and 3rd order needed.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7464-0
00:35:19.737 --> 00:35:20.727
Is it linearly dependent?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7490-0
00:35:21.787 --> 00:35:25.226
So they are linearly and you can
check it using any of the things

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7490-1
00:35:25.226 --> 00:35:28.457
they'll be linearly independent,
but still it is not a basis.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7512-0
00:35:30.327 --> 00:35:31.847
You need 4 for our four.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7522-0
00:35:31.307 --> 00:35:33.687
Dimension should be 4 Bracco.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7515-0
00:35:31.707 --> 00:35:32.667
Well, yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7530-0
00:35:32.517 --> 00:35:35.957
Because there are three three
vectors, we need 4.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7527-0
00:35:34.697 --> 00:35:35.627
Well, it's matters.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7548-0
00:35:36.937 --> 00:35:40.831
Yeah, it's a four dimensional
space R4, no three can be

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7548-1
00:35:40.831 --> 00:35:42.987
linearly, linearly independent.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7552-0
00:35:42.997 --> 00:35:43.347
Spandex.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7556-0
00:35:44.817 --> 00:35:45.897
You require 4 vectors.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7558-0
00:35:50.287 --> 00:35:50.507
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7563-0
00:35:53.257 --> 00:35:53.417
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7564-0
00:35:53.417 --> 00:35:54.067
You should.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7576-0
00:35:56.267 --> 00:35:56.627
Agreed.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7583-0
00:35:56.397 --> 00:35:58.157
So one more vector we need or
what?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7594-0
00:35:57.867 --> 00:36:00.403
One more vector which is
linearly independent with this

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7594-1
00:36:00.403 --> 00:36:00.947
is required.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7595-0
00:36:01.497 --> 00:36:02.037
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7597-0
00:36:02.047 --> 00:36:03.117
So it's OK. OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7620-0
00:36:05.237 --> 00:36:11.396
OK, uh, now this is the these
are just results which will be

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7620-1
00:36:11.396 --> 00:36:15.637
useful to you in some theorem
proving so.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7637-0
00:36:17.627 --> 00:36:19.827
We consider only finite
dimension vector space or

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7637-1
00:36:19.827 --> 00:36:21.147
dimension of the vector space.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7657-0
00:36:21.157 --> 00:36:23.765
We consider with only be finite
in this case, but there is

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7657-1
00:36:23.765 --> 00:36:25.357
something called topological
space.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7659-0
00:36:26.777 --> 00:36:27.267
Uh.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7703-0
00:36:27.277 --> 00:36:30.174
Which had infinite dimensional
vector spaces and I'm not going

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7703-1
00:36:30.174 --> 00:36:33.026
to consider any of them here
because all our mission learning

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7703-2
00:36:33.026 --> 00:36:35.923
things are finite in number and
we're going to use only finite

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7703-3
00:36:35.923 --> 00:36:36.797
dimensional spaces.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7744-0
00:36:39.077 --> 00:36:44.433
Now if U is a subspace of B then
dimension of U will be less than

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7744-1
00:36:44.433 --> 00:36:49.221
or equal dimension of V and
dimension of U equal dimension

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7744-2
00:36:49.221 --> 00:36:52.467
of V if one only if uh U equal
to B OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7749-0
00:36:54.917 --> 00:36:55.087
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7762-0
00:36:56.117 --> 00:37:01.190
OK, so these are just two simple
consequences which are there

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7762-1
00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:01.517
now.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7769-0
00:37:01.527 --> 00:37:04.677
I have already given these uh,
things.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7781-0
00:37:04.687 --> 00:37:06.327
Now, how do you find these
basis?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7786-0
00:37:06.337 --> 00:37:09.527
The basis is basically you try
the.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7811-0
00:37:11.817 --> 00:37:18.988
And you try finding out the RREF
form and then you can find the

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7811-1
00:37:18.988 --> 00:37:20.557
pivot columns.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7818-0
00:37:20.567 --> 00:37:22.207
They form a the basis.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7846-0
00:37:22.217 --> 00:37:27.745
So for example, if I take X1 X
2X3X4 and this is a subspace of

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7846-1
00:37:27.745 --> 00:37:31.167
R5 Now everything is fine
dimensional.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7860-0
00:37:31.177 --> 00:37:34.207
Are you able to see that one 2
-, 1 -, 1, one?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7866-0
00:37:34.217 --> 00:37:35.217
There are five elements here.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7886-0
00:37:36.037 --> 00:37:40.863
Now we want to check whether X1
X 2X3X4 constitute the basis for

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7886-1
00:37:40.863 --> 00:37:41.977
the subspace U.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7899-0
00:37:43.067 --> 00:37:45.877
OK, So what are the two things
it should do?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7946-0
00:37:49.037 --> 00:37:53.258
Quarterly basis, there are two
conditions it should be able to

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7917-0
00:37:49.857 --> 00:37:50.207
Should be.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7954-0
00:37:51.587 --> 00:37:55.407
It should be linearly dependent
linearly independent.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7929-0
00:37:52.167 --> 00:37:52.637
And then maybe.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7946-1
00:37:53.258 --> 00:37:55.067
span lead in independently.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7937-0
00:37:53.797 --> 00:37:54.027
And.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7943-0
00:37:54.337 --> 00:37:54.557
We.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7952-0
00:37:54.887 --> 00:37:55.047
And.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7968-0
00:37:55.217 --> 00:38:00.259
So you you write them as columns
and do the RREF and if you try

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7968-1
00:38:00.259 --> 00:38:01.047
to do the.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7993-0
00:38:02.937 --> 00:38:06.253
Are you of this you will try to
find whether you are getting

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/7993-1
00:38:06.253 --> 00:38:08.427
them to be linearly independent
or not.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8000-0
00:38:08.897 --> 00:38:10.127
Yeah, linearly independent.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8013-0
00:38:10.137 --> 00:38:13.367
Then you you it will constitute
a basis, agree.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8017-0
00:38:14.807 --> 00:38:15.317
The guitar.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8024-0
00:38:15.327 --> 00:38:17.027
Is it possible to sew please?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8028-0
00:38:18.227 --> 00:38:18.687
This one.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8033-0
00:38:19.497 --> 00:38:19.737
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8036-0
00:38:19.627 --> 00:38:19.987
Because.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8039-0
00:38:21.137 --> 00:38:22.057
Can I use octave?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8038-0
00:38:21.507 --> 00:38:21.927
Difficult.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8054-0
00:38:24.267 --> 00:38:26.247
OK. Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8053-0
00:38:24.937 --> 00:38:25.597
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8067-0
00:38:27.007 --> 00:38:27.527
OK, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8073-0
00:38:28.497 --> 00:38:29.587
OK, Sir, use the OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8062-0
00:38:28.777 --> 00:38:29.127
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8077-0
00:38:29.137 --> 00:38:30.327
Can I do a smaller example?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8079-0
00:38:30.777 --> 00:38:31.247
Yeah, yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8097-0
00:38:31.257 --> 00:38:33.727
Smaller will be helpful when
this definitely.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8113-0
00:38:32.977 --> 00:38:35.447
Because this will it will take
take 10 minutes for me.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8102-0
00:38:33.977 --> 00:38:34.657
Yeah, it's very.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8122-0
00:38:34.667 --> 00:38:36.207
Yeah, I can understand. Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8130-0
00:38:36.307 --> 00:38:38.997
I'll take 10 minutes for me to
even do this now.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8134-0
00:38:38.677 --> 00:38:39.137
Yeah, yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8151-0
00:38:39.007 --> 00:38:48.619
So so I will, I will give you
this example can 123 and two 1

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8151-1
00:38:48.619 --> 00:38:49.407
-, 3.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8153-0
00:38:51.267 --> 00:38:51.607
Uh.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8163-0
00:38:56.837 --> 00:39:00.147
So you is spanned.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8161-0
00:38:56.917 --> 00:38:57.317
22.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8184-0
00:39:01.787 --> 00:39:07.127
By, let's call it U-1 and U2U
spanned by U-1 and U2.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8191-0
00:39:08.137 --> 00:39:10.877
Now is this a?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8215-0
00:39:13.357 --> 00:39:15.227
BITS isn't agreed.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8219-0
00:39:16.677 --> 00:39:16.967
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8233-0
00:39:16.977 --> 00:39:18.777
When you realize this is, this
is OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8235-0
00:39:18.697 --> 00:39:20.067
Basis for our three error.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8236-0
00:39:21.247 --> 00:39:21.427
What?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8260-0
00:39:23.917 --> 00:39:26.577
Basis for R3 is what we're
looking for, right, R3?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8261-0
00:39:25.937 --> 00:39:27.547
No, no, it is a no, no.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8267-0
00:39:27.657 --> 00:39:29.757
You is a subspace of artery.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8297-0
00:39:31.997 --> 00:39:36.737
And R3 is nothing but the this
one ohh 3 universal space OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8284-0
00:39:32.347 --> 00:39:32.987
Look like.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8292-0
00:39:34.187 --> 00:39:34.887
3 dimensional space.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8308-0
00:39:37.747 --> 00:39:40.337
This is ugly items.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8300-0
00:39:38.797 --> 00:39:39.187
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8321-0
00:39:39.197 --> 00:39:41.037
OK, OK. Umm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8337-0
00:39:40.667 --> 00:39:43.688
The room where you are sitting,
this is 3 times space and you

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8334-0
00:39:42.877 --> 00:39:43.097
Umm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8337-1
00:39:43.688 --> 00:39:45.247
are spanned by you on a new two.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8353-0
00:39:45.447 --> 00:39:47.307
Now is you on and you two are
basis.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8352-0
00:39:45.577 --> 00:39:45.807
Hmm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8377-0
00:39:47.427 --> 00:39:50.372
Then it is very easy to check
now what you should check

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8377-1
00:39:50.372 --> 00:39:52.897
whether they are linearly
independent, correct.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8389-0
00:39:53.467 --> 00:39:55.477
And so they're linearly
independent here.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8391-0
00:39:55.717 --> 00:39:57.287
So how do you check any
independence?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8406-0
00:39:57.297 --> 00:40:02.117
You just put them in 12321 minus
3, correct?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8412-0
00:40:02.687 --> 00:40:02.897
Umm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8417-0
00:40:04.047 --> 00:40:05.977
And then you will do the roll
action business.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8424-0
00:40:05.987 --> 00:40:06.667
So what did you get?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8433-0
00:40:09.137 --> 00:40:10.457
How many pivot columns did you
get?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8448-0
00:40:15.327 --> 00:40:15.887
They do that here.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8455-0
00:40:16.637 --> 00:40:16.897
1.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8466-0
00:40:16.787 --> 00:40:18.527
Yeah, 222.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8468-0
00:40:17.067 --> 00:40:20.437
If I do, if I do, R2 goes to R 2
-, 2, R one.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8472-0
00:40:18.757 --> 00:40:19.397
Who? Who?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8477-0
00:40:20.447 --> 00:40:20.967
What will I get?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8503-0
00:40:22.087 --> 00:40:28.647
Two or two 120 and minus 3.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8498-0
00:40:27.207 --> 00:40:27.747
And that's three.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8519-0
00:40:29.417 --> 00:40:32.537
Then do R3 goes to R 3 -, 3, R
one.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8536-0
00:40:33.997 --> 00:40:38.197
Three 0 -, 3, -, 6.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8527-0
00:40:34.287 --> 00:40:35.197
0 -, 9.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8532-0
00:40:36.567 --> 00:40:36.887
My.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8538-0
00:40:38.427 --> 00:40:40.197
Ohh minus nine.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8547-0
00:40:40.207 --> 00:40:41.007
Yeah, OK. Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8550-0
00:40:41.427 --> 00:40:42.597
Now, what are the different
columns?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8557-0
00:40:43.987 --> 00:40:45.897
Ohh one.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8559-0
00:40:45.727 --> 00:40:45.987
1.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8570-0
00:40:46.447 --> 00:40:48.077
One and minus 3.

00:40:50.057 --> 00:40:50.597
One and two.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8602-0
00:40:51.107 --> 00:40:51.687
Running to.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8595-0
00:40:51.197 --> 00:40:52.047
Both are one.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8617-0
00:40:51.427 --> 00:40:53.727
Both are favorite columns, both
are.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8623-0
00:40:53.017 --> 00:40:54.697
One and two when.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8626-0
00:40:54.177 --> 00:40:55.367
One is this, yeah, yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8627-0
00:40:54.527 --> 00:40:56.617
These two are feeling 2 pivot
columns.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8629-0
00:40:56.627 --> 00:40:56.927
This is.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8655-0
00:40:58.417 --> 00:41:02.739
How how this is to when they
said one, I can understand 100

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8655-1
00:41:02.739 --> 00:41:03.387
is there.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8663-0
00:41:04.157 --> 00:41:06.627
What do no consulate row wise?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8705-0
00:41:06.677 --> 00:41:09.936
If you see from the first row,
you have first nonzero entry,

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8705-1
00:41:09.936 --> 00:41:13.142
here the second one nonzero
entry is here, so these two are

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8687-0
00:41:10.207 --> 00:41:11.227
Yeah, yeah, correct.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8697-0
00:41:12.917 --> 00:41:13.267
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8705-2
00:41:13.142 --> 00:41:14.157
proven columns, no?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8699-0
00:41:13.277 --> 00:41:13.567
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8703-0
00:41:13.657 --> 00:41:15.277
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, correct.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8712-0
00:41:15.287 --> 00:41:15.747
Yes. Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8722-0
00:41:16.207 --> 00:41:19.157
If you have a situation, so I'll
try drawing a different thing.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8754-0
00:41:19.167 --> 00:41:24.674
If you have a situation where
you have a 100200 uh 3 -, 2,

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8754-1
00:41:24.674 --> 00:41:28.687
four, suppose you have a system
like this.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8749-0
00:41:27.297 --> 00:41:27.517
Hmm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8769-0
00:41:29.377 --> 00:41:32.017
The first nonzero entry here is
1, correct?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8768-0
00:41:31.607 --> 00:41:32.567
Yes, yes, yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8790-0
00:41:33.587 --> 00:41:37.612
The second nonzero entry is
here, and the third nonzero

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8783-0
00:41:35.077 --> 00:41:36.227
This, yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8790-1
00:41:37.612 --> 00:41:38.547
entries here.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8794-0
00:41:38.897 --> 00:41:39.057
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8797-0
00:41:39.737 --> 00:41:40.677
Have you done some mistake?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8810-0
00:41:41.777 --> 00:41:43.277
No stupid column here.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8808-0
00:41:44.217 --> 00:41:44.567
No.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8815-0
00:41:44.527 --> 00:41:45.067
Because to be.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8816-0
00:41:44.577 --> 00:41:45.537
Have I done some mistake?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8851-0
00:41:46.627 --> 00:41:50.107
This like the same column cannot
have like.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8827-0
00:41:46.737 --> 00:41:46.947
No.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8841-0
00:41:48.187 --> 00:41:48.817
No, it's OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8845-0
00:41:48.407 --> 00:41:49.437
Have been going down.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8839-0
00:41:49.897 --> 00:41:50.337
I know.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8853-0
00:41:50.347 --> 00:41:50.667
No, no.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8891-0
00:41:50.667 --> 00:41:52.807
No, for for, for, for it's.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8893-0
00:41:50.677 --> 00:41:53.747
Please understand if the third
one is not the.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8889-0
00:41:50.877 --> 00:41:52.447
No, this is not a favorite
table.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8883-0
00:41:51.357 --> 00:41:52.977
You can do elementary
operations.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8917-0
00:41:52.817 --> 00:41:54.487
It's the whole should be 00.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8900-0
00:41:52.857 --> 00:41:54.697
This phone line, no third has
to.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8908-0
00:41:52.987 --> 00:41:54.027
Support can be made.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8895-0
00:41:54.037 --> 00:41:54.287
Non.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8904-0
00:41:54.777 --> 00:41:55.157
Be zero.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8911-0
00:41:55.167 --> 00:41:55.907
Yeah, that has to be.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8929-0
00:41:55.837 --> 00:41:56.747
You know, it should be 0.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8919-0
00:41:55.997 --> 00:41:56.467
0 right.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8938-0
00:41:57.507 --> 00:41:58.567
It has to do, yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8942-0
00:41:57.527 --> 00:42:01.027
Feel that means you have the
first nonzero entry here.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8943-0
00:42:01.727 --> 00:42:01.947
Umm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8959-0
00:42:04.317 --> 00:42:07.607
And the second nonzero entry in
the 2nd row.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8971-0
00:42:07.817 --> 00:42:10.287
2nd row yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8973-0
00:42:07.907 --> 00:42:11.059
So this becomes one pivot column
and this becomes one pivot

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/8973-1
00:42:11.059 --> 00:42:11.427
column.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9006-0
00:42:12.637 --> 00:42:17.386
Why this is the other 1200 is
not a pivot column is because

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9006-1
00:42:17.386 --> 00:42:20.077
200 is nothing but two times
100.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9018-0
00:42:21.187 --> 00:42:23.697
You can generate a second column
from the first column, right?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9032-0
00:42:24.507 --> 00:42:26.857
Yeah, multiplying by two, yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9047-0
00:42:26.207 --> 00:42:30.138
But you blame me too, so that is
the reason two is 200 is not a

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9047-1
00:42:30.138 --> 00:42:30.937
pivot column.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9066-0
00:42:30.947 --> 00:42:33.146
If the number of pivot columns
are there, it means that they

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9066-1
00:42:33.146 --> 00:42:34.047
are linearly independent.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9068-0
00:42:34.057 --> 00:42:34.437
Agree.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9095-0
00:42:34.797 --> 00:42:38.487
Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9086-0
00:42:35.847 --> 00:42:37.137
OK, that means it is a basis.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9101-0
00:42:38.137 --> 00:42:39.417
Why you change 4 to 0?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9102-0
00:42:38.167 --> 00:42:40.277
And what is the problem with
that earlier when you?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9098-0
00:42:40.377 --> 00:42:40.647
Why?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9106-0
00:42:40.657 --> 00:42:40.987
Why is?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9111-0
00:42:42.447 --> 00:42:43.137
What is the problem?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9121-0
00:42:43.147 --> 00:42:44.957
When you return 3 -, 2, four,
Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9130-0
00:42:46.427 --> 00:42:48.107
Earlier you said this is a
mistake in this.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9131-0
00:42:49.367 --> 00:42:49.657
Hmm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9139-0
00:42:52.197 --> 00:42:52.547
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9157-0
00:42:52.557 --> 00:42:55.687
The the 3 -, 2, four, because it
has to be 0, right?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9156-0
00:42:52.927 --> 00:42:55.427
Because that number was OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9174-0
00:42:55.737 --> 00:43:00.272
The the last four one has to
become zero if we are creating

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9174-1
00:43:00.272 --> 00:43:02.237
the generating the things.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9208-0
00:43:04.187 --> 00:43:08.683
So consecutively then the next
number was non 0 so it should be

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9201-0
00:43:08.247 --> 00:43:08.487
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9208-1
00:43:08.683 --> 00:43:09.737
non zero it is.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9217-0
00:43:08.977 --> 00:43:12.127
Dude actually goes through
active.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9221-0
00:43:10.077 --> 00:43:12.927
There was not an area for my
think Hari form, yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9222-0
00:43:12.177 --> 00:43:13.637
Let's do R2.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9240-0
00:43:16.037 --> 00:43:16.727
Why do you get it?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9259-0
00:43:16.387 --> 00:43:21.417
If these two are three plus 2R0,
it will become 0000.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9263-0
00:43:19.597 --> 00:43:19.857
0.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9270-0
00:43:20.297 --> 00:43:21.007
It will become zero.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9272-0
00:43:21.427 --> 00:43:22.117
It will come, yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9273-0
00:43:22.297 --> 00:43:22.817
It should be.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9285-0
00:43:23.367 --> 00:43:26.177
No, check whether it is in RE
form.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9287-0
00:43:27.287 --> 00:43:27.547
Umm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9290-0
00:43:27.287 --> 00:43:27.917
Correct. Yep.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9308-0
00:43:28.657 --> 00:43:32.037
One yes, it is there and this is
theirs.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9301-0
00:43:29.527 --> 00:43:29.787
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9304-0
00:43:30.427 --> 00:43:30.647
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9312-0
00:43:31.617 --> 00:43:31.987
Like this?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9310-0
00:43:33.477 --> 00:43:33.917
Got it.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9311-0
00:43:34.937 --> 00:43:35.097
But.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9328-0
00:43:37.387 --> 00:43:37.747
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9323-0
00:43:37.437 --> 00:43:38.787
So the same baby proof.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9352-0
00:43:38.827 --> 00:43:42.991
So the same day the above one we
can make 9 into 0 right in the

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9352-1
00:43:42.991 --> 00:43:43.577
last row.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9365-0
00:43:44.727 --> 00:43:48.607
The two years on this, but minus
nine is that becomes 0.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9350-0
00:43:44.947 --> 00:43:45.377
What is it?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9359-0
00:43:45.387 --> 00:43:45.707
Which one?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9391-0
00:43:50.717 --> 00:43:52.527
Yeah, but still it will have
only two, huh?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9384-0
00:43:51.527 --> 00:43:52.557
Minus the fail.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9388-0
00:43:52.967 --> 00:43:53.417
Yeah, two.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9406-0
00:43:53.427 --> 00:43:54.167
Yes, exactly, yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9420-0
00:43:54.417 --> 00:43:57.510
I'm ready too because, because
because I thought you will do

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9407-0
00:43:54.447 --> 00:43:55.517
Yeah, that will be true.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9419-0
00:43:55.527 --> 00:43:55.947
Yes, yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9420-1
00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:58.017
that part.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9446-0
00:44:01.727 --> 00:44:03.876
So what is the condition to
check whether it does, uh,

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9441-0
00:44:02.547 --> 00:44:03.167
I don't sleep.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9446-1
00:44:03.876 --> 00:44:04.697
linearly independent?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9459-0
00:44:06.027 --> 00:44:08.274
You try to find out the number
of pivot columns and the number

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9459-1
00:44:08.274 --> 00:44:08.667
of vectors.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9475-0
00:44:11.307 --> 00:44:12.277
You would column is 2.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9510-0
00:44:12.937 --> 00:44:19.531
So for example, if I give you a
system where it is 100200 and 3

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9491-0
00:44:14.207 --> 00:44:14.597
He worked.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9510-1
00:44:19.531 --> 00:44:25.507
-, 1 and 0, are these three
vectors linearly independent?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9512-0
00:44:26.897 --> 00:44:27.107
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9516-0
00:44:28.067 --> 00:44:28.267
No.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9522-0
00:44:28.257 --> 00:44:28.467
No.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9528-0
00:44:28.927 --> 00:44:29.127
No.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9529-0
00:44:29.227 --> 00:44:29.407
No.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9536-0
00:44:29.377 --> 00:44:30.327
No, no, no, no, no.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9551-0
00:44:30.157 --> 00:44:33.107
Only there are two pivot pivot
columns, no.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9553-0
00:44:30.817 --> 00:44:32.327
2nd dependent on 1st.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9555-0
00:44:32.137 --> 00:44:32.837
OK, which can?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9564-0
00:44:32.277 --> 00:44:35.907
One yes, yes, yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9559-0
00:44:33.677 --> 00:44:34.647
But there are three vectors.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9572-0
00:44:36.437 --> 00:44:36.717
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9570-0
00:44:36.497 --> 00:44:38.087
But the second column is.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9583-0
00:44:38.167 --> 00:44:40.007
Can be generated from first
column right?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9618-0
00:44:40.027 --> 00:44:43.017
By multiplying by two so that is
not really linearly independent.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9598-0
00:44:40.517 --> 00:44:41.187
Exactly.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9609-0
00:44:41.457 --> 00:44:42.527
So if I if I.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9673-0
00:44:42.787 --> 00:44:48.353
So if I if I call this vector
V1, if I call this vector V2, if

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9673-1
00:44:48.353 --> 00:44:53.919
I call this vector V3, I will
have a situation where two times

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9656-0
00:44:52.107 --> 00:44:52.707
Is equal to.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9673-2
00:44:53.919 --> 00:44:57.807
V 1 -, 1 times V 2 + 0 times V3
equal to 0.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9667-0
00:44:54.907 --> 00:44:55.287
Equal to.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9682-0
00:44:57.867 --> 00:44:58.677
This zero is a vector.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9681-0
00:44:58.117 --> 00:44:59.407
Yeah. Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9687-0
00:45:00.437 --> 00:45:02.077
Are all the coefficients zeros
here?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9697-0
00:45:03.927 --> 00:45:04.127
No.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9700-0
00:45:05.037 --> 00:45:06.697
That means they're linearly
dependent, right?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9710-0
00:45:09.167 --> 00:45:09.607
Yes, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9714-0
00:45:10.267 --> 00:45:12.007
That's what you find out using
this REF.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9726-0
00:45:13.507 --> 00:45:16.077
What is the equation 2V1 minus
V2?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9738-0
00:45:16.087 --> 00:45:17.967
How you are you are you busy?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9742-0
00:45:19.177 --> 00:45:20.387
Your voice is not very clear.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9755-0
00:45:20.397 --> 00:45:21.147
Can you be a little louder?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9756-0
00:45:21.747 --> 00:45:22.817
So have you worried?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9776-0
00:45:22.827 --> 00:45:25.767
Arrived at this equation, my 2 V
1 -, 1 V 2.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9801-0
00:45:25.527 --> 00:45:29.173
Yeah, the The thing is because
the second column can be written

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9801-1
00:45:29.173 --> 00:45:32.705
as two teams of first column
because it's a non pivot column,

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9801-2
00:45:32.705 --> 00:45:33.047
right?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9812-0
00:45:34.087 --> 00:45:35.397
Ah, yes, OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9828-0
00:45:36.247 --> 00:45:40.727
But I write that 2 V 1 -, 1 V 2
+ 0, V 3 equal to 0.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9830-0
00:45:44.807 --> 00:45:45.107
Agree.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9837-0
00:45:47.867 --> 00:45:48.127
Agree.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9838-0
00:45:48.757 --> 00:45:49.487
OK, fine.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9842-0
00:45:48.997 --> 00:45:49.267
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9883-0
00:45:49.557 --> 00:45:53.112
So when you when we, when we
when I use it in cooking for

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9883-1
00:45:53.112 --> 00:45:56.912
example I check where linear
dependence or independence based

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9883-2
00:45:56.912 --> 00:46:00.651
on whether I can get one item as
a linear combination of the

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9883-3
00:46:00.651 --> 00:46:01.387
other items.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9891-0
00:46:01.577 --> 00:46:02.887
So I will write a few items.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9907-0
00:46:02.897 --> 00:46:05.217
You stop me whenever I'm
crossing the linear

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9907-1
00:46:05.217 --> 00:46:05.887
independence.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9913-0
00:46:06.777 --> 00:46:08.237
So I take a salt.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9917-0
00:46:08.517 --> 00:46:09.597
Is it linearly independent?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9921-0
00:46:12.497 --> 00:46:12.657
No.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9935-0
00:46:12.627 --> 00:46:14.597
Linear eat.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9938-0
00:46:14.407 --> 00:46:14.847
Do.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9933-0
00:46:14.417 --> 00:46:14.607
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9931-0

00:46:15.947 --> 00:46:16.067
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9950-0
00:46:16.147 --> 00:46:16.307
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9952-0
00:46:16.267 --> 00:46:17.357
Yes, yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9946-0
00:46:16.387 --> 00:46:16.887
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9953-0
00:46:17.217 --> 00:46:17.787
Then sugar.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9959-0
00:46:18.547 --> 00:46:19.787
Yes, yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9958-0
00:46:19.477 --> 00:46:19.617
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9960-0
00:46:19.837 --> 00:46:19.977
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9967-0
00:46:20.557 --> 00:46:22.467
Uh people that.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9990-0
00:46:23.677 --> 00:46:26.307
He powder people, yes, yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9975-0
00:46:24.107 --> 00:46:24.327
No.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9989-0
00:46:24.787 --> 00:46:26.127
Yes, yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9986-0
00:46:25.347 --> 00:46:26.907
It's I'm saying.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9995-0
00:46:25.577 --> 00:46:27.257
Umm just yeah, yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/9999-0
00:46:27.367 --> 00:46:29.237
Hey, the game is very simple.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10018-0
00:46:29.367 --> 00:46:33.139
Check if any one of them can be
got as a linear combination of

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10018-1
00:46:33.139 --> 00:46:34.277
the other elements.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10035-0
00:46:34.287 --> 00:46:35.887
Can you get solved from sugar
and tea?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10029-0
00:46:34.367 --> 00:46:34.927
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10037-0
00:46:36.207 --> 00:46:36.567
No, no.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10053-0
00:46:37.297 --> 00:46:40.827
Sugar from salt and tea he from
salt and sugar.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10049-0
00:46:37.597 --> 00:46:37.777
So.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10048-0
00:46:38.777 --> 00:46:39.057
Never.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10050-0
00:46:39.517 --> 00:46:39.717
No.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10058-0
00:46:41.177 --> 00:46:41.397
No.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10060-0
00:46:41.907 --> 00:46:42.097
No.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10061-0
00:46:42.137 --> 00:46:42.357
No.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10063-0
00:46:43.257 --> 00:46:43.827
Milk powder.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10074-0
00:46:44.507 --> 00:46:47.517
No milk powder, sugar it is
sugar.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10073-0
00:46:45.737 --> 00:46:45.917
No.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10081-0
00:46:47.527 --> 00:46:48.787
Is there right and milk powder?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10084-0
00:46:49.727 --> 00:46:49.997
I'm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10090-0
00:46:49.907 --> 00:46:50.367
That means.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10097-0
00:46:50.007 --> 00:46:51.777
I'm just trying to understand,
yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10098-0
00:46:52.327 --> 00:46:52.947
Yeah, yeah, correct.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10103-0
00:46:52.677 --> 00:46:53.317
Milk is also.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10113-0
00:46:54.687 --> 00:46:56.097
OK, so I.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10115-0
00:46:55.057 --> 00:46:56.627
So that means it is not.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10138-0
00:46:56.637 --> 00:46:59.677
It is not, uh, linear
independent.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10118-0
00:46:57.327 --> 00:46:57.677
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10124-0
00:46:57.687 --> 00:46:58.017
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10127-0
00:46:58.027 --> 00:46:58.757
So let let.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10143-0
00:46:58.847 --> 00:47:00.977
So let let me let me write only
milker.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10146-0
00:47:01.757 --> 00:47:02.017
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10151-0
00:47:01.807 --> 00:47:06.317
Then the moment I say this is
and the.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10157-0
00:47:07.807 --> 00:47:09.347
Uh harmonic?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10169-0
00:47:10.997 --> 00:47:12.747
And no, it it doesn't.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10178-0
00:47:12.227 --> 00:47:14.277
Then I will say Chili's.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10173-0
00:47:12.637 --> 00:47:12.807
You know.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10174-0
00:47:12.757 --> 00:47:13.267
Metric.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10176-0
00:47:13.317 --> 00:47:13.557
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10180-0
00:47:15.287 --> 00:47:15.857
No.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10192-0
00:47:15.907 --> 00:47:18.277
So these are all linear
independent.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10190-0
00:47:16.507 --> 00:47:16.697
You know.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10233-0
00:47:16.677 --> 00:47:16.817
But.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10213-0
00:47:18.287 --> 00:47:20.247
These are all linear
independent, yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10221-0
00:47:18.677 --> 00:47:22.347
These are independent, but the
moment I put some masala powder.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10228-0
00:47:23.507 --> 00:47:25.417
Then it will become linear
dependent, right?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10227-0
00:47:23.677 --> 00:47:24.147
Exactly.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10242-0
00:47:25.427 --> 00:47:26.747
Anything can be, yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10277-0
00:47:25.637 --> 00:47:29.444
Yeah, gotta why this is linear
dependent because you can write

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10277-1
00:47:29.444 --> 00:47:32.889
masala powder as a linear
combination of salt, turmeric,

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10277-2
00:47:32.889 --> 00:47:34.037
chillies et cetera.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10265-0
00:47:33.087 --> 00:47:34.117
Anything it can be.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10285-0
00:47:34.127 --> 00:47:36.217
Yeah, it can be mixture of
anyone other thing.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10290-0
00:47:34.927 --> 00:47:38.197
So that is what I am trying to
do.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10312-0
00:47:38.467 --> 00:47:42.451
The moment I add 200 I'm getting
this to be 2 times 100 so it

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10318-0
00:47:38.747 --> 00:47:38.877
You.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10312-1
00:47:42.451 --> 00:47:43.737
becomes independent.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10354-0
00:47:46.617 --> 00:47:46.897
You know.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10335-0
00:47:46.757 --> 00:47:50.867
I never to get the second column
from the first column agree.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10332-0
00:47:46.917 --> 00:47:47.147
Umm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10341-0
00:47:51.367 --> 00:47:51.607
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10355-0
00:47:52.807 --> 00:47:55.283
That is how you make you are you
understand whether this is

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10355-1
00:47:55.283 --> 00:47:56.727
linearly independent or
dependent.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10356-0
00:47:57.267 --> 00:47:57.477
Umm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10368-0
00:47:59.707 --> 00:47:59.967
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10364-0
00:48:00.377 --> 00:48:00.947
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10371-0
00:48:00.687 --> 00:48:01.657
Sept said.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10377-0
00:48:01.347 --> 00:48:01.877
No. Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10380-0
00:48:01.667 --> 00:48:03.347
I had a quick question here.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10390-0
00:48:02.137 --> 00:48:05.547
Within basis, Sir basis basis.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10385-0
00:48:04.037 --> 00:48:04.197
What?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10394-0
00:48:05.407 --> 00:48:07.117
I had a quick question here Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10428-0
00:48:07.307 --> 00:48:11.072
So for establishing linear
independence, if we get it to

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10428-1
00:48:11.072 --> 00:48:14.904
RAJKARAN form, is it enough or
should should we get it to

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10428-2
00:48:14.904 --> 00:48:15.697
reduced row?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10435-0
00:48:16.807 --> 00:48:17.937
You can do with both.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10445-0
00:48:17.947 --> 00:48:20.397
Baba. Doesn't matter.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10437-0
00:48:18.797 --> 00:48:19.327
OK, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10448-0
00:48:19.337 --> 00:48:20.767
Sir Roy Echelon will.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10466-0
00:48:21.037 --> 00:48:24.767
OK, reduced draw will always be
unique, right?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10450-0
00:48:21.327 --> 00:48:21.817
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10463-0
00:48:21.887 --> 00:48:23.097
So if you if you.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10475-0
00:48:26.117 --> 00:48:28.067
Yeah, the news story is unique.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10489-0
00:48:28.437 --> 00:48:32.627
You can you you can do RREF, REF
whatever business you want.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10481-0
00:48:28.667 --> 00:48:28.947
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10531-0
00:48:32.637 --> 00:48:35.308
But then you try to find the
pivot rows and the non pivot

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10531-1
00:48:35.308 --> 00:48:37.197
pivot columns and the non pivot
columns.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10515-0
00:48:35.397 --> 00:48:35.977
Got it.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10521-0
00:48:36.017 --> 00:48:36.447
Got it.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10528-0
00:48:36.457 --> 00:48:38.947
So yeah, that part is clear.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10547-0
00:48:39.107 --> 00:48:39.927
Just wanted to know if.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10552-0
00:48:39.157 --> 00:48:42.167
If you have non pivot columns
then you can do it.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10562-0
00:48:42.177 --> 00:48:44.587
RREF is a few more steps after
REF.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10573-0
00:48:44.597 --> 00:48:45.657
So you're spending more energy?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10577-0
00:48:44.857 --> 00:48:47.567
Yes, yes, yes, yes, got it.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10600-0
00:48:47.767 --> 00:48:51.978
You can do it with less energy
itself if it is computationally

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10585-0
00:48:47.877 --> 00:48:48.217
Got it.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10591-0
00:48:50.407 --> 00:48:51.037
Yes, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10602-0
00:48:51.307 --> 00:48:51.697
Thank you, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10600-1
00:48:51.978 --> 00:48:52.647
intensive.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10606-0
00:48:52.657 --> 00:48:53.127
OK, fine.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10618-0
00:48:53.627 --> 00:48:56.247
Now there is something called as
a land 90 theorem.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10644-0
00:48:56.757 --> 00:49:00.884
While many of my colleagues said
they were not very happy with

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10644-1
00:49:00.884 --> 00:49:05.207
this, putting it here, I thought
for whatever it is worth, it is.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10660-0
00:49:05.277 --> 00:49:07.571
It is given here because it will
help you in solving some

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10660-1
00:49:07.571 --> 00:49:07.927
problems.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10683-0
00:49:09.007 --> 00:49:13.101
Now what this says is you try to
find the rank of a matrix A and

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10683-1
00:49:13.101 --> 00:49:15.117
the dimension of the null space.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10708-0
00:49:15.127 --> 00:49:18.499
Now you know null space, the set
of all vectors which solve a X

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10708-1
00:49:18.499 --> 00:49:19.237
equal to zero.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10720-0
00:49:19.247 --> 00:49:20.657
You put them all in a Dumber.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10734-0
00:49:21.207 --> 00:49:27.083
It'll be a vector space and and
you can find the dimension of

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10734-1
00:49:27.083 --> 00:49:27.367
it.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10750-0
00:49:27.697 --> 00:49:30.881
If you add these two, you should
get the number of columns of a

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10750-1
00:49:30.881 --> 00:49:31.727
which is N agree.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10772-0
00:49:35.977 --> 00:49:37.397
Motivating, not getting.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10777-0
00:49:36.657 --> 00:49:38.387
Sir, can you please repeat the
statement?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10770-0
00:49:36.747 --> 00:49:38.417
So yeah, what is it now?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10780-0
00:49:38.427 --> 00:49:38.947
Yeah, yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10798-0
00:49:39.887 --> 00:49:41.177
Can you do an example and throw
you?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10792-0
00:49:41.617 --> 00:49:42.267
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10814-0
00:49:42.337 --> 00:49:44.197
Yeah, you're going to say that
will better.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10810-0
00:49:42.417 --> 00:49:42.997
Yeah, that's better.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10812-0
00:49:42.827 --> 00:49:43.307
You said.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10817-0
00:49:43.837 --> 00:49:44.567
Yes, please, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10819-0
00:49:45.287 --> 00:49:45.917
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10843-0
00:49:46.287 --> 00:49:49.746
I will ask one of my left
tenants to help me with

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10843-1
00:49:49.746 --> 00:49:53.827
something upper N pritika can
you give me a good matrix A?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10855-0
00:49:58.457 --> 00:49:59.777
Or maybe I will take it.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10865-0
00:49:59.857 --> 00:50:02.057
So let me take 1224.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10875-0
00:50:05.267 --> 00:50:05.587
Umm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10870-0
00:50:05.727 --> 00:50:06.007
Agree.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10878-0
00:50:07.847 --> 00:50:09.227
Now, what is the rank of a?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10886-0
00:50:10.857 --> 00:50:11.277
1.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10890-0
00:50:12.197 --> 00:50:13.077
Then copy.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10891-0
00:50:14.327 --> 00:50:14.487
What?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10895-0
00:50:14.787 --> 00:50:14.997
2.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10940-0
00:50:15.227 --> 00:50:21.436
One we this is 1 because if you
do the RREF business, you'll get

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10904-0
00:50:15.407 --> 00:50:15.557
And.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10911-0
00:50:16.317 --> 00:50:16.547
2.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10908-0
00:50:16.337 --> 00:50:16.787
How?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10913-0
00:50:17.157 --> 00:50:18.007
How how one?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10940-1
00:50:21.436 --> 00:50:24.397
a 1200 number of nonzeros is 1.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10957-0
00:50:25.027 --> 00:50:27.617
00 OK 1/2.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10975-0
00:50:27.557 --> 00:50:33.664
OK, now you try to solve AXE
equal to zero, which means 1224

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10975-1
00:50:33.664 --> 00:50:35.967
times X1X2 equal to 00.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/10983-0
00:50:37.817 --> 00:50:38.067
Hmm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11007-0
00:50:39.067 --> 00:50:44.161
So this will give you X1 plus
2X2 equal to zero and two X 1 +

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11007-1
00:50:44.161 --> 00:50:46.297
4 X 2 equal to 0, correct.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11011-0
00:50:46.757 --> 00:50:46.967
Umm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11014-0
00:50:47.807 --> 00:50:48.307
You should.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11022-0
00:50:48.587 --> 00:50:51.057
Now the second candy question is
not special.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11037-0
00:50:51.067 --> 00:50:53.119
It is exactly the first
equation, but multiplied by two,

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11037-1
00:50:53.119 --> 00:50:53.407
correct.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11046-0
00:50:53.837 --> 00:50:54.117
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11039-0
00:50:53.987 --> 00:50:54.197
But.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11056-0
00:50:54.737 --> 00:50:54.887
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11060-0
00:50:54.927 --> 00:50:55.297
Got it.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11095-0
00:50:55.007 --> 00:51:00.388
So you have basically yeah X1
plus 2X2 equal to zero, which

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11066-0
00:50:55.537 --> 00:50:57.327
To be happy, infinitely many
solutions.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11095-1
00:51:00.388 --> 00:51:06.218
means whenever you take X2 equal
to K you take X1 equal to minus

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11095-2
00:51:06.218 --> 00:51:06.487
2K.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11099-0
00:51:06.697 --> 00:51:07.457
It'll solve correct.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11101-0
00:51:08.167 --> 00:51:08.337
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11105-0
00:51:08.417 --> 00:51:08.627
Umm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11118-0
00:51:09.757 --> 00:51:13.617
So what is your X1 X 2X1X2 is of
the form.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11127-0
00:51:15.767 --> 00:51:17.467
Minus 2K K.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11141-0
00:51:18.357 --> 00:51:21.677
Oh, this is nothing but K *, -,
2, one correct.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11144-0
00:51:22.117 --> 00:51:22.557
Yes, yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11151-0
00:51:23.437 --> 00:51:23.727
And.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11160-0
00:51:23.817 --> 00:51:26.707
Now something which is like done
like this.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11172-0
00:51:26.717 --> 00:51:33.497
This is generated by so solution
space solution is generated by.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11180-0
00:51:35.797 --> 00:51:37.067
Minus 21, correct.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11185-0
00:51:38.547 --> 00:51:38.767
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11187-0
00:51:39.147 --> 00:51:39.317
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11196-0
00:51:39.197 --> 00:51:39.377
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11201-0
00:51:40.187 --> 00:51:40.307
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11203-0
00:51:40.557 --> 00:51:41.737
Now, what is the dimension of
this?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11207-0
00:51:40.657 --> 00:51:43.007
Dimension IS11.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11211-0
00:51:43.737 --> 00:51:45.377
Dimension of nullspace.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11221-0
00:51:47.337 --> 00:51:49.327
Equal to what if you add rank?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11227-0
00:51:51.217 --> 00:51:52.857
Plus dimension of null space.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11243-0
00:51:56.527 --> 00:51:58.657
This will give you 1 + 1 which
is equal 2.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11247-0
00:51:56.817 --> 00:51:57.067
Really.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11255-0
00:51:58.667 --> 00:52:01.047
This two is nothing but number
of columns of a.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11259-0
00:52:01.777 --> 00:52:02.537
No, Jesus.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11260-0
00:52:03.137 --> 00:52:03.417
Please.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11263-0
00:52:05.267 --> 00:52:05.607
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11265-0
00:52:06.747 --> 00:52:07.037
Agree.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11297-0
00:52:07.727 --> 00:52:08.097
Umm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11279-0
00:52:09.957 --> 00:52:10.387

00:52:10.517 --> 00:52:11.157
Yes it.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11287-0
00:52:10.527 --> 00:52:13.047
Said how do we dimension of null
space one?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11298-0
00:52:14.297 --> 00:52:16.477
Because it is generated by only
one vector, no?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11299-0
00:52:16.177 --> 00:52:16.717
Let's see.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11306-0
00:52:19.387 --> 00:52:20.187
Umm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11331-0
00:52:20.987 --> 00:52:21.247
And.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11322-0
00:52:21.157 --> 00:52:23.477
For this example, dimension is
one, yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11312-0
00:52:21.277 --> 00:52:21.637
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11333-0
00:52:23.617 --> 00:52:26.647
Yeah, for this example dimension
is 1 and argued example only.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11355-0
00:52:28.347 --> 00:52:31.967
So I would I would the rank of A
is 1 so 1200.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11360-0
00:52:32.937 --> 00:52:35.077
That would make, yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11383-0
00:52:33.337 --> 00:52:41.252
1200 You do R2 goes to R 2 -, 2
R one, then A will be reduced to

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11383-1
00:52:41.252 --> 00:52:42.957
1200, correct?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11388-0
00:52:43.277 --> 00:52:44.007
Yeah, right. Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11405-0
00:52:44.417 --> 00:52:48.243
I defined rank as number of
nonzero rows in a row reduced

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11405-1
00:52:48.243 --> 00:52:49.167
form, correct?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11433-0
00:52:50.457 --> 00:52:53.397
It is one row only 10.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11410-0
00:52:50.607 --> 00:52:50.997
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11412-0
00:52:51.667 --> 00:52:51.997
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11419-0
00:52:52.007 --> 00:52:52.617
OK, fine.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11447-0
00:52:52.767 --> 00:52:57.957
So it is 112 is a one day row,
000 right tick.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11432-0
00:52:52.887 --> 00:52:53.237
Thank you.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11446-0
00:52:55.467 --> 00:52:56.407
Umm hmm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11452-0
00:52:55.467 --> 00:52:57.097
Yeah, that thing.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11459-0
00:52:58.027 --> 00:53:00.007
OK, so this is what is a
consequence.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11477-0
00:53:00.367 --> 00:53:05.377
Now there is one more thing I
wrote for the general case when

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11477-1
00:53:05.377 --> 00:53:06.347
N being odd.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11502-0
00:53:06.657 --> 00:53:11.791
If N is odd, let's say N is 7,
then can you have dimension of

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11502-1
00:53:11.791 --> 00:53:16.097
the null space of A and the rank
of it to be equal?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11508-0
00:53:19.227 --> 00:53:19.567
Lucy.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11511-0
00:53:19.647 --> 00:53:19.877
No.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11532-0
00:53:20.667 --> 00:53:23.518
No, because rank of A+ dimension
of a both are equal means it

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11517-0
00:53:21.137 --> 00:53:21.267
No.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11532-1
00:53:23.518 --> 00:53:25.817
will be an even number right
rank plus dimension.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11541-0
00:53:27.897 --> 00:53:28.107
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11542-0
00:53:28.047 --> 00:53:28.487
Yes, yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11544-0
00:53:28.447 --> 00:53:28.607
The.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11563-0
00:53:29.637 --> 00:53:33.511
But N is odd, so the sum of two
numbers which are equal it

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11563-1
00:53:33.511 --> 00:53:35.087
cannot be an odd number.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11573-0
00:53:35.097 --> 00:53:38.417
Correct, but these are some
little consequences.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11569-0
00:53:35.797 --> 00:53:36.017
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11581-0
00:53:38.757 --> 00:53:41.467
The which can be drawn.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11593-0
00:53:41.537 --> 00:53:44.437
So what is the maximum value of
dimension of null space of a?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11601-0
00:53:49.407 --> 00:53:50.487
I'm more of call, honey.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11600-0
00:53:49.497 --> 00:53:49.747
Hope.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11628-0
00:53:53.747 --> 00:53:56.456
Yeah, these are both integer
values, right dimension, rank of

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11628-1
00:53:56.456 --> 00:53:58.247
and dimension of null space of
a, right?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11629-0
00:53:58.767 --> 00:53:59.687
N minus rank.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11631-0
00:54:01.987 --> 00:54:02.167
What?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11639-0
00:54:05.527 --> 00:54:06.447
N minus rank.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11645-0
00:54:07.747 --> 00:54:08.427
Maximum.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11659-0
00:54:08.157 --> 00:54:12.281
No, no, I am asking what is the
maximum value of dimension of

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11659-1
00:54:12.281 --> 00:54:12.547
NFA.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11660-0
00:54:14.057 --> 00:54:14.277
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11665-0
00:54:17.117 --> 00:54:17.367
And.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11666-0
00:54:17.207 --> 00:54:17.517
You can.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11692-0
00:54:17.877 --> 00:54:22.667
Presumably and minus one and
minus one.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11681-0
00:54:19.287 --> 00:54:19.987
I'm not sure.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11688-0
00:54:20.137 --> 00:54:21.187
In minus one.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11689-0
00:54:21.877 --> 00:54:22.587
And minus one.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11704-0
00:54:23.577 --> 00:54:26.247
Uh, so rank of yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11716-0
00:54:26.257 --> 00:54:30.947
Yes, dimension of rank of YA and
dimension of end of YA is.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11718-0
00:54:30.957 --> 00:54:31.267
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11726-0
00:54:31.277 --> 00:54:32.327
And there is end here.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11755-0
00:54:32.977 --> 00:54:39.038
Now you can have a a system
where for example, if I take a N

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11755-1
00:54:39.038 --> 00:54:43.907
to be let's say five, you can
have this to be 5.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11760-0
00:54:43.917 --> 00:54:44.747
This to be 0.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11773-0
00:54:44.757 --> 00:54:50.057
This addition is 5 correct 415
and so on.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11768-0
00:54:47.087 --> 00:54:47.267
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11781-0
00:54:50.067 --> 00:54:51.077
What will be the last entry?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11795-0
00:54:52.597 --> 00:54:54.797
14145.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11785-0
00:54:52.787 --> 00:54:52.957
But.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11803-0
00:54:55.247 --> 00:54:58.847
145 why not 055?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11822-0
00:55:00.237 --> 00:55:01.527
0 means null metrics.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11827-0
00:55:00.257 --> 00:55:02.677
Why not zero will be.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11867-0
00:55:02.057 --> 00:55:06.532
A zero is a null matrix, so only
you can go up to if it is a non

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11837-0
00:55:02.187 --> 00:55:03.997
0 means all the rules are zero.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11851-0
00:55:04.827 --> 00:55:06.077
The twins and right.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11867-1
00:55:06.532 --> 00:55:09.837
null matrix you can have rank of
eight to be 1.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11861-0
00:55:07.557 --> 00:55:07.697
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11889-0
00:55:10.047 --> 00:55:13.649
The dimensional space would be
equal to four, so it basically N

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11890-0
00:55:13.277 --> 00:55:14.007
N -, 1.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11889-1
00:55:13.649 --> 00:55:13.987
minus.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11897-0
00:55:14.957 --> 00:55:15.747
And minus one.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11917-0
00:55:16.187 --> 00:55:20.896
There's a consequence of this
speaker, but are we set to start

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11917-1
00:55:20.896 --> 00:55:23.587
with the second, the third
Lecture?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11915-0
00:55:24.427 --> 00:55:25.017
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11925-0
00:55:25.067 --> 00:55:25.377
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11940-0
00:55:25.387 --> 00:55:28.187
So VENKITESWARAN tell we have
voting now if you can set

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11932-0
00:55:25.467 --> 00:55:25.987
He said.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11940-1
00:55:28.187 --> 00:55:28.937
voting, please.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11947-0
00:55:30.497 --> 00:55:31.807
I want to spend 10 minutes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11951-0
00:55:31.817 --> 00:55:32.507
OK, please.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11963-0
00:55:32.517 --> 00:55:34.657
Uh, now how do I?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11968-0
00:55:33.757 --> 00:55:34.777
We can quickly do.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11974-0
00:55:34.667 --> 00:55:35.347
How do I do it?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11976-0
00:55:36.087 --> 00:55:37.337
Yeah, that's also I have.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/11990-0
00:55:37.347 --> 00:55:40.077
I was also facing the same how
we can do it?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12000-0
00:55:40.087 --> 00:55:41.837
We can do in teams channel is
there.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12013-0
00:55:43.767 --> 00:55:45.117
We do further either way.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12018-0
00:55:44.167 --> 00:55:47.927
To actually somebody, then one
second, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12036-0
00:55:48.227 --> 00:55:51.520
Here somebody has posted in the
chat with different signs for

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12036-1
00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:52.157
routing set.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12043-0
00:55:52.407 --> 00:55:53.787
So I think that will help here.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12048-0
00:55:55.027 --> 00:55:55.447
See here.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12055-0
00:55:56.257 --> 00:55:58.027
But uh, react on this message.

00:58:50.077 --> 00:58:54.637
26 OK this order, one algorithm
says people are OK more people

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12644-0
00:58:50.857 --> 00:58:51.227

In.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12676-0
00:58:58.057 --> 00:58:59.137
So can we conclude that?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12679-0
00:59:00.007 --> 00:59:01.187
Please please please.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12687-0

Yes, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12697-0
00:59:02.277 --> 00:59:03.007
It's a.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12722-0
00:59:02.347 --> 00:59:04.237
Yes, Sir, I'm getting visa, yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12707-0
00:59:03.047 --> 00:59:03.627
Yes, speaker.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12721-0

00:59:03.237 --> 00:59:04.157
Yes, Sir, Friday is.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12710-0
00:59:04.167 --> 00:59:04.507
I will.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12724-0
00:59:04.217 --> 00:59:04.437
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12718-0
00:59:04.527 --> 00:59:05.677
Schedule the schedule it.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12725-0
00:59:05.677 --> 00:59:06.197
And give it.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12728-0
00:59:06.647 --> 00:59:06.997
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12734-0
00:59:07.007 --> 00:59:07.407
Thank you.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12746-0
00:59:07.407 --> 00:59:08.097
Thank you, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12742-0
00:59:07.657 --> 00:59:08.327
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12749-0
00:59:08.437 --> 00:59:08.937
Thank you very.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12752-0
00:59:08.607 --> 00:59:09.387
Others, if you have.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12761-0
00:59:08.637 --> 00:59:09.077
Thank you, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12763-0
00:59:09.077 --> 00:59:09.197
Much.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12767-0
00:59:09.457 --> 00:59:11.377
Some other freedom and you want
to talk to me?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12775-0
00:59:11.387 --> 00:59:12.417
You organize the session.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12787-0
00:59:12.427 --> 00:59:14.127
I will be willing to do it
through the week.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12790-0
00:59:15.017 --> 00:59:15.797
Don't worry about that.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12812-0
00:59:18.837 --> 00:59:20.707
If some of you feel that I
should do some.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12805-0
00:59:19.187 --> 00:59:19.467
One.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12810-0
00:59:19.667 --> 00:59:20.437
So is that.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12833-0
00:59:22.597 --> 00:59:25.207
So so there will be no class on
Saturday.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12830-0
00:59:22.757 --> 00:59:23.767
Said excuse me, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12827-0
00:59:22.917 --> 00:59:23.077
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12845-0
00:59:25.457 --> 00:59:27.697
Yeah, no class on Saturday,
Sunday.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12844-0
00:59:25.537 --> 00:59:26.897
There will be class only on
Sunday.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12857-0
00:59:33.087 --> 00:59:33.307
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12871-0
00:59:33.557 --> 00:59:34.737
This is why every week, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12881-0
00:59:33.567 --> 00:59:36.617
This is and you only that I
plug.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12877-0
00:59:36.217 --> 00:59:37.087
This is one day.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12882-0
00:59:37.197 --> 00:59:38.627
This is one day for 16th.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12887-0
00:59:41.197 --> 00:59:41.437
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12888-0
00:59:43.127 --> 00:59:43.567
That's OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12923-0
00:59:45.207 --> 00:59:49.608
And I might use a similar thing
for the nonlinear optimization

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12923-1
00:59:49.608 --> 00:59:54.079
where I need to do little more
like things so that will be 11th

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12923-2
00:59:54.079 --> 00:59:55.197
or 12th session.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12927-0
00:59:55.267 --> 00:59:56.437
I may do one more Sunday.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12932-0
01:00:00.907 --> 01:00:01.587
No problem, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12936-0
01:00:02.647 --> 01:00:04.087
OK, right.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12938-0
01:00:05.827 --> 01:00:06.097
So.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12947-0
01:00:08.337 --> 01:00:09.857
I'm going to catch up on certain
norms.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12953-0
01:00:12.427 --> 01:00:12.917
An army.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12978-0
01:00:12.927 --> 01:00:16.781
Some concept of a length in
higher dimensions, we used to

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12978-1
01:00:16.781 --> 01:00:19.307
say in one dimension it is very
easy.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12992-0
01:00:19.317 --> 01:00:22.758
You just measure the distance
from the origin and you call it

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/12992-1
01:00:22.758 --> 01:00:23.147
a norm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13004-0
01:00:23.617 --> 01:00:25.957
Now, how do we do it in multi
dimensions?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13019-0
01:00:26.777 --> 01:00:29.807
It actually there are some few
properties of norms.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13038-0
01:00:30.417 --> 01:00:33.626
The absolute homogeneous
properties that norm of Lambda

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13038-1
01:00:33.626 --> 01:00:36.377
axis you take a Lambda out with
a model assign.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13051-0
01:00:37.947 --> 01:00:42.737
Now you will find always
triangle inequality which is we

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13051-1
01:00:42.737 --> 01:00:43.157
have.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13105-0
01:00:43.167 --> 01:00:47.077
Why this triangle inequality is
because you always say that the

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13105-1
01:00:47.077 --> 01:00:50.986
sum of two sides of a triangle
is always greater than the third

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13105-2
01:00:50.986 --> 01:00:54.713
set when X&amp;Y are vectors,
you know norm X plus norm Y is

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13105-3
01:00:54.713 --> 01:00:58.623
measuring the diagonal and this
will be more than the length of

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13105-4
01:00:58.623 --> 01:00:59.417
X plus white.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13109-0
01:01:01.097 --> 01:01:01.667
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13160-0
01:01:01.717 --> 01:01:05.381
The third one is the positive
definite, which means to say

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13160-1
01:01:05.381 --> 01:01:08.672
that whenever you have an
elector, except now Max is

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13160-2
01:01:08.672 --> 01:01:12.150
always more than equal to 0
because it is denoting some

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13160-3
01:01:12.150 --> 01:01:16.187
length and nomics is equal to 0
will imply that X is equal to 0.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13170-0
01:01:16.777 --> 01:01:18.487
This right hand said zero is a
vector.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13195-0
01:01:19.017 --> 01:01:23.323
Please understand when I write
excess of bold X and write as a

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13195-1
01:01:23.323 --> 01:01:26.467
normal zero don't get confused
scale of zero.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13200-0
01:01:26.477 --> 01:01:27.067
It's a vector 0.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13210-0
01:01:28.347 --> 01:01:30.237
Now, there are some typically
used norms.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13226-0
01:01:30.247 --> 01:01:32.537
One is called the man had a norm
or the one norm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13239-0
01:01:33.447 --> 01:01:36.204
You'll take the sum of absolute
values of all the elements of

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13239-1
01:01:36.204 --> 01:01:36.427
that.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13246-0
01:01:37.177 --> 01:01:38.787
And racked up.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13253-0
01:01:39.877 --> 01:01:40.947
This is called the one.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13262-0
01:01:40.957 --> 01:01:42.687
Now you can also do the two
knob.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13282-0
01:01:42.697 --> 01:01:45.844
Here you take the square of each
element, add them, and then take

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13282-1
01:01:45.844 --> 01:01:46.607
the square root.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13309-0
01:01:46.677 --> 01:01:51.164
So these are two simple norms,
and you can really prove the

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13309-1
01:01:51.164 --> 01:01:55.054
second one is slightly
difficult, but you can still

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13309-2
01:01:55.054 --> 01:01:55.727
prove it.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13325-0
01:01:56.117 --> 01:01:59.651
It is just involving little
algebra, but all the three

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13325-1
01:01:59.651 --> 01:02:01.707
properties can be proved agreed.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13327-0
01:02:04.827 --> 01:02:05.227
Agreeable.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13331-0
01:02:08.167 --> 01:02:08.737
Umm yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13368-0
01:02:10.077 --> 01:02:14.797
OK, now there is something
called, uh, the dot product dot

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13343-0
01:02:11.707 --> 01:02:12.087
Yes, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13368-1
01:02:14.797 --> 01:02:19.677
product is basically nothing,
but you take the corresponding

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13368-2
01:02:19.677 --> 01:02:23.757
elements in X&amp;Y, you
multiply them and add he.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13380-0
01:02:23.767 --> 01:02:26.167
Basically it is extraposed way
which is called the dot product.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13391-0
01:02:27.337 --> 01:02:30.227
Now there is something called as
a bilinear mapping.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13421-0
01:02:30.237 --> 01:02:33.471
What is a bilinear mapping is
because he's something where

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13421-1
01:02:33.471 --> 01:02:36.541
there is a linearity with
respect to the first argument

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13421-2
01:02:36.541 --> 01:02:37.857
and the second argument.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13450-0
01:02:39.037 --> 01:02:43.326
Now, if you take uh ohmega with
two arguments, you take the

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13450-1
01:02:43.326 --> 01:02:47.687
first argument as Lambda X + y
and the second argument of Z.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13506-0
01:02:48.177 --> 01:02:53.023
You can split it as Lambda times
X comma, Z Omega of X comma Z

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13506-1
01:02:53.023 --> 01:02:58.023
plus side times Omega of Y comma
ZUC is linear if you take it to

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13506-2
01:02:58.023 --> 01:03:02.869
the second argument Omega of X
comma, Lambda Y plus side Z you

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13506-3
01:03:02.869 --> 01:03:06.177
can again take the laptop out
and you can.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13512-0
01:03:07.047 --> 01:03:08.077
You can do this site.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13522-0
01:03:08.387 --> 01:03:10.517
You see the both the expressions
are one and the same.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13527-0
01:03:10.527 --> 01:03:11.247
Are you able to see that?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13564-0
01:03:15.207 --> 01:03:19.541
In the sense it is able to take
out the the thing and you can

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13545-0
01:03:15.607 --> 01:03:16.107
Easter.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13564-1
01:03:19.541 --> 01:03:22.617
have only the the, the the
function inside.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13572-0
01:03:22.687 --> 01:03:25.657
You can take the constants out
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13570-0
01:03:24.977 --> 01:03:25.217
Hmm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13586-0
01:03:27.487 --> 01:03:31.477
But uh Venkat, just quick 11
doubt here.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13580-0
01:03:27.867 --> 01:03:28.137
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13588-0
01:03:31.037 --> 01:03:31.217
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13605-0
01:03:31.627 --> 01:03:36.557
** is same but there is
Z&amp;Z&amp;Y.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13599-0
01:03:36.327 --> 01:03:36.937
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13609-0
01:03:36.987 --> 01:03:38.537
No, no, I'm not talking about
exit.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13617-0
01:03:38.627 --> 01:03:40.717
I'm talking about the nature.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13628-0
01:03:40.207 --> 01:03:41.737
Umm OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13634-0
01:03:40.727 --> 01:03:42.397
I'm not talking about the exact
value.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13639-0
01:03:41.787 --> 01:03:43.407
Ah, OK, good.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13669-0
01:03:42.987 --> 01:03:47.266
I'm saying you can take whatever
you did in line number one, you

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13655-0
01:03:46.927 --> 01:03:47.207
Hmm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13669-1
01:03:47.266 --> 01:03:51.217
take the the constants out there
and you take the function.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13671-0
01:03:49.797 --> 01:03:50.017
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13681-0
01:03:51.227 --> 01:03:52.867
The same thing happens in two
right.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13689-0
01:03:53.277 --> 01:03:54.457
Yes, yes, yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13716-0
01:03:54.127 --> 01:03:57.787
The first thing it is exed and
YZ, the second one it is XY and

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13716-1
01:03:57.787 --> 01:04:01.157
XZ, but then the the the the
overall process is the same.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13706-0
01:03:58.427 --> 01:03:58.647
We.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13726-0
01:04:01.267 --> 01:04:02.147
The values are different.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13721-0
01:04:01.397 --> 01:04:03.027
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13745-0
01:04:03.037 --> 01:04:07.266
So you mean to say the functions
are nothing but Omega of XZ or

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13745-1
01:04:07.266 --> 01:04:07.927
YZ, right?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13755-0
01:04:08.147 --> 01:04:08.537
Yeah, correct.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13763-0
01:04:08.237 --> 01:04:10.607
But the constants are out, so
that's the thing.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13774-0
01:04:10.627 --> 01:04:12.837
No conscience that out there,
and it is linear.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13776-0
01:04:10.657 --> 01:04:13.577
That is, yeah, yeah, yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13798-0
01:04:14.667 --> 01:04:18.303
OK, suppose you have B as a
retail space and this Omega as

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13798-1
01:04:18.303 --> 01:04:19.597
the bilinear mapping.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13836-0
01:04:20.727 --> 01:04:24.505
Then this Omega is called
symmetric if if you interchange

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13836-1
01:04:24.505 --> 01:04:28.609
the X&amp;Y you should not have
a change in the value, so this

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13836-2
01:04:28.609 --> 01:04:32.127
is Omega of X comma Y equal to
Omega of Y comma of X.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13866-0
01:04:33.097 --> 01:04:37.827
It is called positive definite
if Omega of X comma X he is more

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13866-1
01:04:37.827 --> 01:04:41.597
than zero and Omega of 0 comma
zero is equal to 0.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13912-0
01:04:41.807 --> 01:04:45.950
Agree this happens for every
Omega fix comma X is more than

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13912-1
01:04:45.950 --> 01:04:50.438
zero whenever X is not equal to
0 and Omega of 0 comma zero is 0

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13912-2
01:04:50.438 --> 01:04:53.407
when inside the Omega there are
two zeros.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13938-0
01:04:52.337 --> 01:04:52.467
The.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13924-0
01:04:53.417 --> 01:04:57.197
Those are vector zeros and the
equal to is a zero.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13932-0
01:04:57.207 --> 01:04:58.157
That's the scalar 0.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13940-0
01:04:58.337 --> 01:04:59.607
I hope you are able to
understand that.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13943-0
01:05:01.347 --> 01:05:01.687
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13944-0
01:05:02.087 --> 01:05:02.387
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13945-0
01:05:03.197 --> 01:05:03.377
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13966-0
01:05:05.777 --> 01:05:07.367
So you can define it now.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13968-0
01:05:06.387 --> 01:05:08.157
So could you please repeat it,
Sir?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13975-0
01:05:08.287 --> 01:05:10.087
Sorry but.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13971-0
01:05:09.267 --> 01:05:09.937
Yeah, sure.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/13990-0
01:05:10.617 --> 01:05:16.477
What I'm saying is this Omega is
called symmetric if if you.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14001-0
01:05:16.487 --> 01:05:18.957
If you flip this X&amp;Y, you
don't change the value.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14013-0
01:05:22.097 --> 01:05:24.427
OK, store.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14042-0
01:05:23.497 --> 01:05:27.114
And this is called positive
definite if if you have a

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14042-1
01:05:27.114 --> 01:05:31.468
nonzero X this Omega of X comma
X is more than zero and Omega of

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14042-2
01:05:31.468 --> 01:05:33.277
0 comma zero is equal to 0.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14085-0
01:05:35.857 --> 01:05:39.610
Which means in the sense that if
my ex off value may be of a four

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14085-1
01:05:39.610 --> 01:05:43.023
or uh more than actually one or
two or three, which is more

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14085-2
01:05:43.023 --> 01:05:45.127
which is actually greater than
zero.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14094-0
01:05:45.137 --> 01:05:46.297
If it is zero, it is zero.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14125-0
01:05:47.057 --> 01:05:54.437
No ** not ** is a vector, X is
not a scalar, X is a scalar.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14122-0
01:05:47.257 --> 01:05:52.827
That is a positive or no is OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14165-0
01:05:54.447 --> 01:05:59.288
This Omega function, if you take
X with X itself, the answer

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14165-1
01:05:59.288 --> 01:06:04.050
should be more than zero as long
as X is not equal to 0X is

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14165-2
01:06:04.050 --> 01:06:05.637
different from zero.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14168-0
01:06:04.477 --> 01:06:04.717
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14188-0
01:06:05.647 --> 01:06:08.979
When you take X equal to 0, this
will become pretend to 0 right

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14188-1
01:06:08.979 --> 01:06:09.187
now.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14186-0
01:06:09.467 --> 01:06:10.757
OK, OK, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14195-0
01:06:10.827 --> 01:06:11.197
Thank you.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14198-0
01:06:11.477 --> 01:06:11.627
Yep.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14202-0
01:06:11.737 --> 01:06:13.037
And then line send.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14205-0
01:06:13.047 --> 01:06:14.007
The second one.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14217-0
01:06:14.017 --> 01:06:15.307
So could you please go back to?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14250-0
01:06:15.607 --> 01:06:18.758
So there's a Lambda X and how
the Lambda is that I mean and

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14222-0
01:06:15.667 --> 01:06:15.847
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14250-1
01:06:18.758 --> 01:06:21.804
the Lambda we are taking out,
but is it does not have the

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14250-2
01:06:21.804 --> 01:06:22.907
Lambda at all, right?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14262-0
01:06:22.917 --> 01:06:23.927
Like how it is coming.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14271-0
01:06:23.937 --> 01:06:24.877
Sir, I am not getting it.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14273-0
01:06:24.467 --> 01:06:25.997
They're very, very Lambda is not
there.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14309-0
01:06:27.797 --> 01:06:33.430
The Omega within the bracket
Lambda of X + I of Y comma Z

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14290-0
01:06:32.837 --> 01:06:33.447
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14309-1
01:06:33.430 --> 01:06:36.247
right and it is equals, yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14306-0
01:06:33.877 --> 01:06:37.007
So the definition, yeah, you.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14361-0
01:06:37.017 --> 01:06:40.366
Whenever you want to do that,
you take X with respect to

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14361-1
01:06:40.366 --> 01:06:43.891
Z&amp;Y with respect to Z and
put the plus in between these

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14322-0
01:06:40.547 --> 01:06:40.777
Hmm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14361-2
01:06:43.891 --> 01:06:47.298
two, and then whatever Lambda is
there, you take out here

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14361-3
01:06:47.298 --> 01:06:49.707
whatever Sai is there you take
out here.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14357-0
01:06:50.527 --> 01:06:50.877
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14359-0
01:06:50.947 --> 01:06:51.197
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14364-0
01:06:51.257 --> 01:06:51.547
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14385-0
01:06:51.557 --> 01:06:54.977
It's like, OK, fine, that's a
separate vector, is that it

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14381-0
01:06:53.447 --> 01:06:53.687
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14385-1
01:06:54.977 --> 01:06:56.687
serves a separate vector. OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14384-0
01:06:55.257 --> 01:06:56.617
Yeah. Correct.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14388-0
01:07:00.467 --> 01:07:00.687
Now.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14426-0
01:07:03.227 --> 01:07:07.422
If you have a positive definite
symmetric bilinear mapping, then

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14426-1
01:07:07.422 --> 01:07:11.553
it is called as an inner product
that you would have studied in

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14426-2
01:07:11.553 --> 01:07:13.877
in the in the college and
etcetera.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14450-0
01:07:14.387 --> 01:07:18.408
Now the only point is they
define inner product and and dot

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14450-1
01:07:18.408 --> 01:07:20.217
product in the similar way.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14478-0
01:07:20.687 --> 01:07:25.950
Dot product is an example of an
inner product in the product is

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14478-1
01:07:25.950 --> 01:07:30.227
much more, much more advanced
compared to the dark.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14480-0
01:07:30.237 --> 01:07:31.127
A simple dot product.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14485-0
01:07:33.017 --> 01:07:33.487
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14505-0
01:07:33.497 --> 01:07:36.925
We, along with this dot product
and the the the inner product is

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14505-1
01:07:36.925 --> 01:07:38.297
calling the product space.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14526-0
01:07:39.787 --> 01:07:43.404
We will show that I know I
symmetric positive definite

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14526-1
01:07:43.404 --> 01:07:46.297
things will play a very
important role now.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14533-0
01:07:46.307 --> 01:07:49.037
There is a there is a.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14558-0
01:07:49.527 --> 01:07:53.626
There is a very small theorem
which says that for a real

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14558-1
01:07:53.626 --> 01:07:58.157
valued finite dimension vector
space B and then ordered basis.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14573-0
01:07:58.167 --> 01:08:01.777
But I will tell you what an
ordered basis is now.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14619-0
01:08:01.887 --> 01:08:06.128
We'll say that a function from V
Cross V to R is an inner product

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14619-1
01:08:06.128 --> 01:08:09.856
if and only if there exists a
symmetric positive definite

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14619-2
01:08:09.856 --> 01:08:13.711
matrix a such that X&amp;Y the
inner product is nothing but

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14619-3
01:08:13.711 --> 01:08:14.547
some in some.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14627-0
01:08:15.117 --> 01:08:17.347
Uh botnet system?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14660-0
01:08:17.357 --> 01:08:22.392
It is X hat transpose AY hat
now, which means that you are

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14660-1
01:08:22.392 --> 01:08:27.513
going to define XY with the
inner product in terms of X hat

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14660-2
01:08:27.513 --> 01:08:28.367
and Y hat.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14683-0
01:08:28.957 --> 01:08:33.884
Now, what are these X hat and Y
hat is how you represent X with

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14683-1
01:08:33.884 --> 01:08:35.347
respect to a basis.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14691-0
01:08:36.097 --> 01:08:38.247
Now that is all contained in
this.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14704-0
01:08:39.177 --> 01:08:43.307
In this matrix A and also in the
exact and Y hat.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14706-0
01:08:44.247 --> 01:08:45.277
OK fine now.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14747-0
01:08:47.307 --> 01:08:51.297
I will not get into the details
of that, but I will just try to

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14747-1
01:08:51.297 --> 01:08:54.850
get you some basic idea that
whenever there is something

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14747-2
01:08:54.850 --> 01:08:58.217
called Yifan only if in the
theorem it goes two ways.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14769-0
01:08:58.287 --> 01:09:01.490
One is from if you assume
something on the left, you have

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14769-1
01:09:01.490 --> 01:09:03.257
to prove something on the right.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14783-0
01:09:03.787 --> 01:09:05.668
If you assume something on the
right, you have to prove

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14783-1
01:09:05.668 --> 01:09:06.407
something on the left.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14798-0
01:09:07.437 --> 01:09:09.687
OK, but before that, what is an
ordered basis?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14830-0
01:09:09.697 --> 01:09:13.667
You find the basis for a vector
space and then you give it a

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14830-1
01:09:13.667 --> 01:09:16.727
number B1B2B3 and don't change
it any further.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14838-0
01:09:17.337 --> 01:09:19.067
That is called an ordered basis.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14853-0
01:09:19.237 --> 01:09:24.067
So you take a basis of V and you
order it in some way.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14848-0
01:09:20.427 --> 01:09:20.997
Stop.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14856-0
01:09:24.437 --> 01:09:25.087
So for example.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14872-0
01:09:29.207 --> 01:09:31.857
Can I take my notebook and write
the ordered basis?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14871-0
01:09:32.097 --> 01:09:33.227
Yes, yes, yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14884-0
01:09:35.987 --> 01:09:37.217
Because this order disks.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14931-0
01:09:41.277 --> 01:09:45.286
So you take for example 10 and
01, you call it as B1 and you

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14931-1
01:09:45.286 --> 01:09:49.426
call it as B2 and don't change
anywhere during an analysis for

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14931-2
01:09:49.426 --> 01:09:53.370
the same set of theorems or
whatever it is, you start using

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14931-3
01:09:53.370 --> 01:09:53.567
it.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14938-0
01:09:53.577 --> 01:09:54.797
This becomes an audit basis.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14941-0
01:09:54.807 --> 01:09:55.117
Agree.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14967-0
01:09:56.607 --> 01:09:59.545
Whatever you're doing with
respect to 10 and 01, you can

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14967-1
01:09:59.545 --> 01:10:01.607
also do with two, three and four
seven.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14991-0
01:10:02.497 --> 01:10:06.548
So in this case you keep this as
B1 this as B2 and don't change

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14991-1
01:10:06.548 --> 01:10:09.207
the number for the rest of your
analysis.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/14995-0
01:10:09.337 --> 01:10:09.747
Then this.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15000-0
01:10:09.757 --> 01:10:11.257
This becomes an ordered basis,
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15003-0
01:10:15.827 --> 01:10:16.107
Agree.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15006-0
01:10:16.937 --> 01:10:17.297
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15034-0
01:10:18.417 --> 01:10:21.534
So why I will tell you there is
a little later because we are

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15034-1
01:10:21.534 --> 01:10:24.701
going to obtain something which
is dependent upon how we write

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15034-2
01:10:24.701 --> 01:10:25.807
these matrix elements.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15045-0
01:10:28.257 --> 01:10:29.337
So there are two things.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15073-0
01:10:29.537 --> 01:10:37.002
And you're the say that and the
the function B from V cross B to

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15073-1
01:10:37.002 --> 01:10:41.367
R do you understand this V cross
V2R?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15081-0
01:10:41.377 --> 01:10:42.077
Should I explain this?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15082-0
01:10:42.817 --> 01:10:43.807
Please explain VENKITESWARAN.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15102-0
01:10:48.267 --> 01:10:49.887
Today explain this or you know.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15093-0
01:10:49.217 --> 01:10:49.527
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15095-0
01:10:49.537 --> 01:10:49.687
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15099-0
01:10:49.697 --> 01:10:50.657
Please, please please.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15110-0
01:10:50.677 --> 01:10:51.317
Venkat Sir, please.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15114-0
01:10:51.827 --> 01:10:52.507
OK, fine.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15112-0
01:10:52.107 --> 01:10:52.797
Yes, please.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15113-0
01:10:52.687 --> 01:10:53.207
Yes, yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15129-0
01:10:53.897 --> 01:10:59.337
OK, so when there is a product
of two things, uh.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15137-0
01:11:01.457 --> 01:11:02.267
1224.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15149-0
01:11:03.547 --> 01:11:09.627
Suppose I call a function F from
uh M cross.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15151-0
01:11:10.857 --> 01:11:12.807
Yes to tea.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15183-0
01:11:13.237 --> 01:11:18.126
What it means is the function
takes 2 arguments, the 1st 21 is

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15183-1
01:11:18.126 --> 01:11:22.937
some small M this belongs to
capital M and comma there is an.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15185-0
01:11:20.257 --> 01:11:21.577
And umm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15187-0
01:11:22.947 --> 01:11:23.427
Yes, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15202-0
01:11:24.057 --> 01:11:26.777
This yes, is a smallest which
belongs to capitalist.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15226-0
01:11:27.257 --> 01:11:31.272
Now this cross is basically to
indicate that every element will

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15226-1
01:11:31.272 --> 01:11:34.347
be of this form and this will
give you some tea.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15235-0
01:11:35.247 --> 01:11:35.767
Would that make?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15241-0
01:11:35.667 --> 01:11:39.597
Bear, this tea belongs to the
capital city, OK?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15251-0
01:11:44.907 --> 01:11:46.357
Can we have an example, Sir?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15252-0
01:11:45.127 --> 01:11:45.387
Agree.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15267-0
01:11:47.237 --> 01:11:53.346
Yeah, but for example, yeah, I
will call the simple interest

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15267-1
01:11:53.346 --> 01:11:54.247
function.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15284-0
01:11:56.567 --> 01:11:57.977
Can you call the simple interest
function?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15281-0
01:11:57.877 --> 01:11:58.907
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15299-0
01:11:58.727 --> 01:12:00.657
My name, OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15292-0
01:11:58.917 --> 01:11:59.367
Please, please.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15293-0
01:11:59.247 --> 01:11:59.517
Don't.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15296-0
01:12:00.037 --> 01:12:01.107
Simple interest function.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15304-0
01:12:01.617 --> 01:12:04.547
This is basically a function
from a.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15309-0
01:12:06.427 --> 01:12:08.177

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15323-0
01:12:09.767 --> 01:12:17.787
Cross some positive real number
and N is some positive integer.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15329-0
01:12:20.007 --> 01:12:20.357
Uh.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15332-0
01:12:20.807 --> 01:12:23.007
Into some positive.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15351-0
01:12:29.827 --> 01:12:33.927
Neil #2 if positive real number,
you know why?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15352-0
01:12:34.707 --> 01:12:35.027
Thank you.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15366-0
01:12:40.417 --> 01:12:43.307
What you do is you take simple
interest function.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15372-0
01:12:43.477 --> 01:12:44.537
You take a principle.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15378-0
01:12:45.147 --> 01:12:45.397
Hmm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15404-0
01:12:45.827 --> 01:12:48.783
You say that that you're
interested for these number of

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15404-1
01:12:48.783 --> 01:12:52.057
years and then you say it is
with our percentage of interest.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15400-0
01:12:49.197 --> 01:12:49.457
Umm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15398-0
01:12:49.367 --> 01:12:49.607
Mobile.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15409-0
01:12:52.147 --> 01:12:52.327
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15416-0
01:12:52.427 --> 01:12:56.557
This will give you P into N into
R by 100.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15428-0
01:12:56.827 --> 01:13:00.017
This is a member of R correct R
positive.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15423-0
01:12:56.877 --> 01:12:57.097
Umm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15429-0
01:13:00.527 --> 01:13:00.867
Umm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15439-0
01:13:02.557 --> 01:13:03.027
Yes, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15440-0
01:13:02.617 --> 01:13:02.877
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15455-0
01:13:03.647 --> 01:13:06.253
He has three arguments and I
have told you for which sets

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15455-1
01:13:06.253 --> 01:13:07.467
these arguments are coming.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15459-0
01:13:08.287 --> 01:13:08.627
Umm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15462-0
01:13:09.287 --> 01:13:10.487
It's wake up.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15461-0
01:13:09.877 --> 01:13:10.097
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15464-0
01:13:10.847 --> 01:13:11.107
Umm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15466-0
01:13:12.117 --> 01:13:12.427
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15530-0
01:13:14.297 --> 01:13:18.610
So in this case, what I'm saying
is, is something like the

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15484-0
01:13:17.207 --> 01:13:17.507
Right.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15530-1
01:13:18.610 --> 01:13:22.776
function is an inner product if
and only if there exists

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15509-0
01:13:19.297 --> 01:13:19.607
Me.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15530-2
01:13:22.776 --> 01:13:27.235
symmetric positive definite
matrix a such that X&amp;Y inner

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15520-0
01:13:26.337 --> 01:13:26.817
I am in.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15530-3
01:13:27.235 --> 01:13:31.474
product is nothing but X hat
transpose AY hat transpose Y

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15530-4
01:13:31.474 --> 01:13:31.767
hat.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15543-0
01:13:32.607 --> 01:13:36.117
Now, hey, there is somebody who
has not muted your system.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15554-0
01:13:43.487 --> 01:13:45.657
Ohh doesn't moniece
Chakravarthy.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15559-0
01:13:49.837 --> 01:13:50.697
Sorry, sorry.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15568-0
01:13:52.367 --> 01:13:52.807
No issues.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15571-0
01:13:53.497 --> 01:13:54.097
No problem.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15620-0
01:13:53.587 --> 01:13:57.984
So one way is to prove that if
this is an inner product, then a

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15620-1
01:13:57.984 --> 01:14:01.899
is symmetric positive definite,
such that XY equal to XA

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15620-2
01:14:01.899 --> 01:14:06.090
transpose AY hat there is the
other way where A is symmetric

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15620-3
01:14:06.090 --> 01:14:10.487
positive definite such that the
operations are defined by this.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15627-0
01:14:10.497 --> 01:14:12.307
Then the operation defines an
inner product.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15651-0
01:14:13.757 --> 01:14:19.030
Now these two are two directions
and I think we have given the

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15651-1
01:14:19.030 --> 01:14:21.457
proof in this in this sensor.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15666-0
01:14:22.737 --> 01:14:25.827
Do you want me to go through the
proof or you think it is?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15689-0
01:14:25.837 --> 01:14:29.454
It is enough if you know that
then enough part is

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15689-1
01:14:29.454 --> 01:14:33.723
characterized by matrix A and
with respect to some ordered

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15689-2
01:14:33.723 --> 01:14:34.157
basis.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15700-0
01:14:37.897 --> 01:14:38.207
Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15713-0
01:14:38.007 --> 01:14:39.297
So can't explain it again.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15721-0
01:14:38.217 --> 01:14:42.167
Here escape is denoting the unit
vector of X&amp;Y.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15728-0
01:14:43.677 --> 01:14:44.967
There is nothing like unit
vector.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15737-0
01:14:47.387 --> 01:14:49.507
What is the escape exactly here?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15745-0
01:14:50.387 --> 01:14:52.787
I'm then I I will do the proof.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15754-0
01:14:52.827 --> 01:14:54.217
Then you understand what escape
is.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15760-0
01:14:54.267 --> 01:14:55.017
OK, exactly.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15761-0
01:14:55.757 --> 01:14:55.897
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15794-0
01:14:57.867 --> 01:15:01.561
So we prove the direction so XY
be the inner point between the

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15794-1
01:15:01.561 --> 01:15:05.197
vectors X&amp;B, so you know
what is an inner product, right?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15799-0
01:15:05.207 --> 01:15:06.007
What is an inner product?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15818-0
01:15:11.817 --> 01:15:14.447
We can utilize all the you.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15821-0
01:15:12.107 --> 01:15:14.107
Component wise product in
addition.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15816-0
01:15:12.817 --> 01:15:13.187
How do you?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15835-0
01:15:14.917 --> 01:15:19.819
Yeah, we can utilize all the
properties of India point which

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15835-1
01:15:19.819 --> 01:15:21.507
I defined previously.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15843-0
01:15:21.107 --> 01:15:24.207
Just umm yeah, yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15842-0
01:15:21.917 --> 01:15:23.207
So if you remember this.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15856-0
01:15:26.357 --> 01:15:26.917
Yes, yes, yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15851-0
01:15:26.597 --> 01:15:28.027
OK, OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15853-0
01:15:28.037 --> 01:15:28.447
We can.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15865-0
01:15:28.497 --> 01:15:29.787
We can use all these things.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15890-0
01:15:30.117 --> 01:15:35.410
So what I'm trying to do is let
XY be an inner product between

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15890-1
01:15:35.410 --> 01:15:37.007
the vectors X1, YB.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15911-0
01:15:37.607 --> 01:15:44.447
Now X is a vector and we have an
ordered pair VI in V.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15928-0
01:15:44.497 --> 01:15:48.783
So will I not be able to write
XI as a linear combination of

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15928-1
01:15:48.783 --> 01:15:49.697
all the bias?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15939-0
01:15:51.897 --> 01:15:53.237
Yes, we can write.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15946-0
01:15:53.767 --> 01:15:56.317
You can write them because this
is an ordered basis.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15978-0
01:15:56.327 --> 01:15:59.157
Don't change anything in their
basis, because if we change the

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15978-1
01:15:59.157 --> 01:16:01.897
basis in the the order didn't
everything will go for a task.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15994-0
01:16:02.777 --> 01:16:07.656
Similarly you can write Y as
Lambda BIDIT for some I for some

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/15994-1
01:16:07.656 --> 01:16:08.837
Lambda I agree.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16009-0
01:16:10.167 --> 01:16:12.127
Umm and.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16019-0
01:16:11.687 --> 01:16:14.594
Now, since it is the inner
product, you will be able to add

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16019-1
01:16:14.594 --> 01:16:15.127
X&amp;Y as.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16031-0
01:16:17.767 --> 01:16:19.517
This some place comma this sum.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16052-0
01:16:19.527 --> 01:16:23.353
Right now you can take both the
sums out and then because why

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16037-0
01:16:20.287 --> 01:16:20.507
Umm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16052-1
01:16:23.353 --> 01:16:24.957
you can take the sums out.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16054-0
01:16:25.247 --> 01:16:25.847
Can you tell me?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16062-0
01:16:28.147 --> 01:16:29.627
Because of the linearity, right?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16065-0
01:16:33.787 --> 01:16:33.947
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16076-0
01:16:35.027 --> 01:16:36.547
OK, so now.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16118-0
01:16:35.887 --> 01:16:39.348
Since both are linear, since
both are linear, that's why you

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16118-1
01:16:39.348 --> 01:16:43.037
are taking the sums out and then
I and Jay are varying from 112.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16100-0
01:16:39.827 --> 01:16:41.187
Yeah, that's why I'm digging.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16106-0
01:16:41.967 --> 01:16:42.417
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16111-0
01:16:42.427 --> 01:16:43.117
I send Jason.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16114-0
01:16:43.127 --> 01:16:43.357
I'm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16181-0
01:16:43.407 --> 01:16:47.633
I'm taking it out and you'll
have Sai BIBJ in a product

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16130-0
01:16:44.917 --> 01:16:45.117
Umm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16181-1
01:16:47.633 --> 01:16:52.539
Lambda chain now this BIBJ inner
product is basically the vector

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16181-2
01:16:52.539 --> 01:16:57.369
that the matrix called A and the
Sai and Lambda J will give you

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16181-3
01:16:57.369 --> 01:17:00.237
this exact and Y hat transpose
agree.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16214-0
01:17:01.487 --> 01:17:07.223
BABJ's coming is becoming A and
Lambda J is becoming Y hat and

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16214-1
01:17:07.223 --> 01:17:10.137
PSI is becoming X hat transpose.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16203-0
01:17:09.637 --> 01:17:10.017
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16206-0
01:17:10.027 --> 01:17:10.237
When?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16231-0
01:17:10.247 --> 01:17:12.805
When you, when you, when you
change from this scalar notation

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16231-1
01:17:12.805 --> 01:17:14.497
to the vector notation it you
get ahead.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16234-0
01:17:14.367 --> 01:17:15.397
Umm OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16243-0
01:17:16.497 --> 01:17:19.207
Is the provision of the X vector
basically right?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16245-0
01:17:19.917 --> 01:17:20.727
Ohio.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16259-0
01:17:22.537 --> 01:17:24.767
Not coefficient of X vector,
Bubba.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16269-0
01:17:25.417 --> 01:17:28.927
This is written in the in the
expanded mode.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16287-0
01:17:28.937 --> 01:17:32.766
If you want to write it in the
compressed mode, you put all

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16287-1
01:17:32.766 --> 01:17:35.447
these elements into this X hat
transpose.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16290-0
01:17:40.437 --> 01:17:40.777
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16293-0
01:17:43.567 --> 01:17:44.407
Yes, but.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16341-0
01:17:49.027 --> 01:17:52.259
So does the AIJ is nothing but
the inner part of BA&amp;BJ now

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16341-1
01:17:52.259 --> 01:17:55.439
excited why you had a dentist
which represent the coordinates

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16341-2
01:17:55.439 --> 01:17:58.517
of the original get test with
respect to the basis vectors.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16374-0
01:17:58.787 --> 01:18:02.539
If you have X&amp;X&amp;Y hat,
then you'll be able to express

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16357-0
01:17:58.927 --> 01:17:59.207
Umm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16374-1
01:18:02.539 --> 01:18:05.687
exact as a linear combination of
this, uh, X&amp;Y.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16377-0
01:18:05.697 --> 01:18:06.057
Right.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16391-0
01:18:06.067 --> 01:18:09.877
So that is what is contained in
this exact uh and by head.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16398-0
01:18:11.957 --> 01:18:12.237
Umm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16416-0
01:18:12.257 --> 01:18:16.551
Speaker, now the inner party say
explicitly mentioned in terms of

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16416-1
01:18:16.551 --> 01:18:17.267
the matrix.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16431-0
01:18:17.277 --> 01:18:21.887
Yeah, symmetries because BIBJ is
same same as BJB in the product.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16441-0
01:18:21.897 --> 01:18:23.487
So A is also a symmetric matrix.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16439-0
01:18:23.487 --> 01:18:23.767
So.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16446-0
01:18:25.447 --> 01:18:26.877
Now for all X.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16454-0
01:18:27.877 --> 01:18:29.487
Yeah, which are different from
zero.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16496-0
01:18:29.497 --> 01:18:32.843
You can also say that X
transpose X is going to be more

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16496-1
01:18:32.843 --> 01:18:36.488
than 0 because the inner product
of the the inner product is

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16496-2
01:18:36.488 --> 01:18:40.372
positive definite means this is
also positive definite and so it

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16496-3
01:18:40.372 --> 01:18:41.507
is X bar transpose.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16498-0
01:18:41.737 --> 01:18:42.887
This actually X hat.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16530-0
01:18:44.887 --> 01:18:47.737
Sir, I think this is this is the
same thing.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16536-0
01:18:45.087 --> 01:18:47.527
APARNA, can you make can you
make a note of this afternoon?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16545-0
01:18:48.207 --> 01:18:50.667
This is the same thing we proved
in LECTURES 0, right?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16575-0
01:18:51.917 --> 01:18:53.417
We did not prove this in Lecture
0.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16559-0
01:18:52.977 --> 01:18:53.527
Yes, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16569-0
01:18:53.537 --> 01:18:55.417
I'll I'll make a note of it,
Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16579-0
01:18:55.427 --> 01:18:55.707
Yes, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16581-0
01:18:55.517 --> 01:18:56.047
Uh.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16586-0
01:18:56.387 --> 01:18:58.157
It's butthead AX.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16587-0
01:18:59.017 --> 01:18:59.407
Yes, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16598-0
01:19:03.747 --> 01:19:05.847
Now the other side is very
similar to this.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16620-0
01:19:05.857 --> 01:19:09.727
We are going to use make use of
the the the symmetry and other

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16620-1
01:19:09.727 --> 01:19:11.877
properties to get this thing
done.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16630-0
01:19:12.827 --> 01:19:14.277
It is likely voluminous.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16657-0
01:19:14.287 --> 01:19:18.287
Yeah, I suggest that you start
doing this and in case you have,

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16657-1
01:19:18.287 --> 01:19:21.037
you have any issues you can get
back to us.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16671-0
01:19:21.047 --> 01:19:25.177
I will also try to expand this
and put it across as a.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16695-0
01:19:25.227 --> 01:19:28.862
As a node in the in the canvas
discussion, this is not very

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16695-1
01:19:28.862 --> 01:19:32.437
tough and then you can I think
you can easily follow this.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16726-0
01:19:34.697 --> 01:19:37.843
Now there are, say, a few
questions based on this and I

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16726-1
01:19:37.843 --> 01:19:41.157
think it is it is better that we
get into those questions.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16738-0
01:19:41.167 --> 01:19:46.323
And can you symmetric positive
definite matrix have less than

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16738-1
01:19:46.323 --> 01:19:47.487
full rank? Uh.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16753-0
01:19:50.077 --> 01:19:52.637
This is what is the is the
question.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16760-0
01:19:53.837 --> 01:19:55.607
So can I pose this question
here?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16765-0
01:20:00.457 --> 01:20:01.037
Which question?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16768-0
01:20:01.907 --> 01:20:02.527
Canon.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16778-0
01:20:04.117 --> 01:20:04.987
Which where where.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16786-0
01:20:04.997 --> 01:20:07.697
Hey I'm writing it down now.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16783-0
01:20:06.127 --> 01:20:06.577
Yes, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16790-0
01:20:08.067 --> 01:20:08.637
OK please.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16793-0
01:20:08.167 --> 01:20:11.597
Tell the symmetric positive
definite.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16796-0
01:20:14.007 --> 01:20:14.547
Matrix.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16798-0
01:20:17.417 --> 01:20:17.747
Now.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16804-0
01:20:19.987 --> 01:20:22.427
Less than full time.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16814-0
01:20:25.917 --> 01:20:26.647
Is that question?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16817-0
01:20:27.117 --> 01:20:28.517
So yeah, he's symmetric.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16821-0
01:20:30.877 --> 01:20:31.387
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16828-0
01:20:31.447 --> 01:20:33.657
This positive definite.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16832-0
01:20:36.477 --> 01:20:37.347
Can you help?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16846-0
01:20:41.477 --> 01:20:44.557
And K less than him, Aman.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16848-0
01:20:44.567 --> 01:20:45.047
Cross it.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16853-0
01:20:45.057 --> 01:20:45.717
Let me see.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16856-0
01:20:46.067 --> 01:20:46.777
Here's a question.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16861-0
01:20:46.967 --> 01:20:47.677
What is your answer?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16867-0
01:20:50.627 --> 01:20:51.877
Can can.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16872-0
01:20:54.087 --> 01:20:54.287
So.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16874-0
01:20:54.157 --> 01:20:54.417
No.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16875-0
01:20:54.157 --> 01:20:54.667
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16877-0
01:20:56.027 --> 01:20:56.387
Uh.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16888-0
01:20:56.627 --> 01:21:01.517
Uh, so SAIRAJ, Vijay.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16934-0
01:21:01.527 --> 01:21:06.798
Development of a same as a of J
comma I this you agree because

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16912-0
01:21:05.647 --> 01:21:07.077
Yeah, yeah, this is.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16934-1
01:21:06.798 --> 01:21:12.152
it's symmetric, correct and you
have extrasport AX is more than

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16934-2
01:21:12.152 --> 01:21:15.917
zero for all X every time not
equal to zero.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16946-0
01:21:16.817 --> 01:21:20.417
OK, now say whether a can have
rank less than N.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16956-0
01:21:24.317 --> 01:21:26.157
Sir, what is XFL this X?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16959-0
01:21:26.717 --> 01:21:27.037
What is?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16967-0
01:21:28.687 --> 01:21:29.507
His ex.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16972-0
01:21:30.807 --> 01:21:32.167
Hey, you've been a little
louder, Bubba.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16985-0
01:21:35.117 --> 01:21:36.207
So what is this X?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/16997-0
01:21:36.217 --> 01:21:37.937
Is this X transpose and X?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17001-0
01:21:37.547 --> 01:21:39.007
For any X party, any exit.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17011-0
01:21:39.807 --> 01:21:41.177
We have frank listening.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17021-0
01:21:41.117 --> 01:21:44.737
So yeah, it it cannot have
anything less than full run.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17025-0
01:21:45.357 --> 01:21:45.757
Wait.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17031-0
01:21:47.327 --> 01:21:48.167
It is possible.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17048-0
01:21:47.337 --> 01:21:54.007
Because the space for equal to 0
only, we can have the in a.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17068-0
01:21:54.017 --> 01:21:57.848
The you know the transfer the X
is greater than zero for X not

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17068-1
01:21:57.848 --> 01:21:58.517
equal to 0.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17090-0
01:21:58.527 --> 01:22:01.567
So only when X equal to zero we
can have.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17092-0
01:22:01.097 --> 01:22:03.267
But what has it got to do with
the rank of a?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17110-0
01:22:08.217 --> 01:22:11.007
OK, they mention it.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17107-0
01:22:10.007 --> 01:22:10.277
Umm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17111-0
01:22:10.127 --> 01:22:11.127
I can give you one hint.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17126-0
01:22:12.337 --> 01:22:15.727
What does the rank validity
theorem state?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17133-0
01:22:17.567 --> 01:22:19.997
There's drank coffee plus
dimension.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17154-0
01:22:23.647 --> 01:22:27.277
They mention A+ dimension of
null spaces, right?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17160-0
01:22:27.757 --> 01:22:28.577
But of column.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17164-0
01:22:29.457 --> 01:22:29.957
That is the end.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17175-0
01:22:30.027 --> 01:22:31.877
Number of in.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17171-0
01:22:30.957 --> 01:22:31.117
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17176-0
01:22:31.697 --> 01:22:33.857
OK, that is sufficient to answer
this question.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17179-0
01:22:44.727 --> 01:22:45.027
Agree.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17208-0
01:22:54.157 --> 01:22:58.167
He has full rank, so he has full
rank in the sense it's N right.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17210-0
01:22:56.077 --> 01:22:56.867
Thermostat.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17212-0
01:22:56.387 --> 01:22:57.227
We said.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17216-0
01:22:58.177 --> 01:22:58.717
Drink kisser.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17219-0
01:22:58.417 --> 01:22:59.717
Now X transpose.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17234-0
01:22:59.777 --> 01:23:04.397
Now X transpose X is more than
zero for all nonzero X, right?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17239-0
01:23:06.747 --> 01:23:06.887
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17240-0
01:23:07.587 --> 01:23:08.077
He is.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17253-0
01:23:10.147 --> 01:23:13.927
So what are the elements are
allowed in the null space?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17261-0
01:23:16.687 --> 01:23:17.627
Only 0 vector.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17271-0
01:23:18.967 --> 01:23:21.687
So for example, what is null
space of a?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17272-0
01:23:21.087 --> 01:23:21.577
Only hello.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17276-0
01:23:23.927 --> 01:23:24.637
All space.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17296-0
01:23:27.367 --> 01:23:33.361
Of the east, the solution space
governed by the solutions of

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17296-1
01:23:33.361 --> 01:23:35.327
eggs and what is he?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17295-0
01:23:34.867 --> 01:23:35.157
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17299-0
01:23:37.927 --> 01:23:38.227
Agree.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17303-0
01:23:39.657 --> 01:23:39.867
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17318-0
01:23:40.887 --> 01:23:47.177
Now for example, let why he
belong to null space off.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17306-0
01:23:40.987 --> 01:23:41.267
A little.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17330-0
01:23:49.877 --> 01:23:53.037
Game therefore AY equal to 0,
right?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17333-0
01:23:53.677 --> 01:23:53.857
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17350-0
01:23:55.467 --> 01:23:58.997
And why is not equal to 0 is
null space of behavior.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17356-0
01:23:59.007 --> 01:24:00.467
So that means AY equal to 0.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17374-0
01:24:01.537 --> 01:24:05.717
Therefore, why transpose AY will
be equal to 0 correct whenever Y

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17374-1
01:24:05.717 --> 01:24:06.857
is not equal to 0?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17385-0
01:24:09.567 --> 01:24:10.097
You see.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17404-0
01:24:10.527 --> 01:24:14.075
I suppose if he lays it called
20 and why is not the white

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17404-1
01:24:14.075 --> 01:24:14.917
transfer site?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17402-0
01:24:14.427 --> 01:24:14.607
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17420-0
01:24:16.777 --> 01:24:18.397
For some, why not equal to zero?
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17434-0
01:24:18.277 --> 01:24:22.232
Or for somebody for some way,
which means this is not positive

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17434-1
01:24:22.232 --> 01:24:23.237
definite, right?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17442-0
01:24:25.537 --> 01:24:25.677
Hello.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17446-0
01:24:26.807 --> 01:24:28.707
Here is not positive definite
correct.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17451-0
01:24:30.737 --> 01:24:31.017
Agree.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17456-0
01:24:31.817 --> 01:24:32.277
Yes, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17460-0
01:24:33.177 --> 01:24:36.017
Which implies only.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17467-0
01:24:36.247 --> 01:24:38.067
Why equal to 0 is allowed?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17476-0
01:24:40.347 --> 01:24:42.537
In the now space.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17491-0
01:24:45.437 --> 01:24:50.807
Which implies dimension of N of
A will be equal to 0, correct?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17494-0
01:24:52.487 --> 01:24:52.707
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17522-0
01:24:54.407 --> 01:25:00.140
Now that I mention of rank of YA
Plus I mention of that space of

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17522-1
01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:02.257
a will be equal to gain.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17526-0
01:25:02.667 --> 01:25:03.597
Now this is 0.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17534-0
01:25:03.647 --> 01:25:05.377
So what is dimension of RA?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17537-0
01:25:05.867 --> 01:25:06.107
And.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17543-0
01:25:06.787 --> 01:25:07.107
In.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17553-0
01:25:08.637 --> 01:25:09.847
He has good, right?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17549-0
01:25:10.347 --> 01:25:10.697
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17560-0
01:25:10.707 --> 01:25:12.317
Yeah, that's what full rank was
in.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17567-0
01:25:12.327 --> 01:25:12.967
That's what. Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17586-0
01:25:14.127 --> 01:25:18.310
But this is how you prove it,
and for this only I had put this

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17586-1
01:25:18.310 --> 01:25:20.567
stuff Dave in the previous
slide.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17590-0
01:25:24.357 --> 01:25:24.637
Agree.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17598-0
01:25:25.827 --> 01:25:26.067
Agree.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17601-0
01:25:25.927 --> 01:25:28.087
So Venkat said just one doubt.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17613-0
01:25:28.097 --> 01:25:33.596
You know, I just please clarify
me is not positive definite,

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17613-1
01:25:33.596 --> 01:25:34.137
right?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17621-0
01:25:34.667 --> 01:25:36.437
What does this mean when kisser?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17637-0
01:25:37.987 --> 01:25:42.997
No, I am saying, OK, uh, I don't
know that.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17652-0
01:25:39.847 --> 01:25:44.127
Umm, I'm sorry, I actually I'm
trying to I yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17648-0
01:25:43.007 --> 01:25:44.617
No, no one second.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17654-0
01:25:44.677 --> 01:25:45.807
Have you seen LECTURES 0?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17664-0
01:25:47.307 --> 01:25:49.007
Yes, yes, RAMKISHAN I've seen.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17665-0
01:25:49.867 --> 01:25:50.237
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17690-0
01:25:50.247 --> 01:25:57.370
So if I take a matrix A which is
1002, let's say easier positive

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17688-0
01:25:56.737 --> 01:25:56.937
Umm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17690-1
01:25:57.370 --> 01:25:58.357
definite.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17693-0
01:26:00.077 --> 01:26:00.247
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17726-0
01:26:01.917 --> 01:26:07.129
It is because if I take any X1X2
and multiply with 1002 and

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17723-0
01:26:05.297 --> 01:26:07.607
Umm. Umm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17726-1
01:26:07.129 --> 01:26:09.127
multiply with the X1X2.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17731-0
01:26:10.587 --> 01:26:11.347
What I'm going to get?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17743-0
01:26:16.817 --> 01:26:18.257
710021.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17741-0
01:26:16.907 --> 01:26:17.437
X1.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17748-0
01:26:20.137 --> 01:26:20.317
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17767-0
01:26:21.307 --> 01:26:24.847
So this is nothing but X not
square plus 2X2 square correct?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17775-0
01:26:25.297 --> 01:26:26.837
Yes, yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17779-0
01:26:26.367 --> 01:26:28.877
Now X1 square is always more
than 0X2.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17817-0
01:26:28.887 --> 01:26:35.083
Square is always more than zero
and this will be more than 0

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17786-0
01:26:30.417 --> 01:26:30.827
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17804-0
01:26:30.837 --> 01:26:33.377
Yeah, that's why it's a good
thing. Umm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17817-1
01:26:35.083 --> 01:26:38.537
whenever X1X2 is not equal to
00.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17848-0
01:26:38.547 --> 01:26:43.294
Correct, but this is positive
definite now when you have

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17823-0
01:26:39.167 --> 01:26:39.707
Yes, yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17832-0
01:26:41.937 --> 01:26:42.357
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17848-1
01:26:43.294 --> 01:26:48.541
positive definite and you want
to find out the solution of the

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17848-2
01:26:48.541 --> 01:26:49.457
null space.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17882-0
01:26:49.467 --> 01:26:53.700
So if I have null space of a
while trying to find out what is

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17866-0
01:26:52.737 --> 01:26:52.947
Umm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17882-1
01:26:53.700 --> 01:26:57.592
there in Null Space Office
suppose null space of A has a

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17882-2
01:26:57.592 --> 01:26:58.207
vector Y.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17887-0
01:26:59.497 --> 01:26:59.797
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17908-0
01:27:01.157 --> 01:27:04.694
Out of all the elements, if I
have some element called, why it

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17908-1
01:27:04.694 --> 01:27:06.827
can have several other elements
also?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17934-0
01:27:06.837 --> 01:27:11.238
Super like say null space of A
has a Y, so by definition this

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17934-1
01:27:11.238 --> 01:27:13.297
is a nonzero vector, correct?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17947-0
01:27:14.057 --> 01:27:15.577
Umm yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17949-0
01:27:15.367 --> 01:27:17.267
Which implies GAY equal to 0.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17953-0
01:27:18.067 --> 01:27:18.297
Umm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17976-0
01:27:19.727 --> 01:27:22.872
Because in terms not space
correct I can multiply with

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17965-0
01:27:21.407 --> 01:27:21.847
Yes, yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17976-1
01:27:22.872 --> 01:27:24.587
white transpose on both sides.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/17980-0
01:27:25.497 --> 01:27:25.707
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18006-0
01:27:26.927 --> 01:27:31.030
But this will say why transpose
AY is equal to 0 for a Y which

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18006-1
01:27:31.030 --> 01:27:34.547
is nonzero, which implies a is
not positive definite.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18032-0
01:27:37.357 --> 01:27:40.245
Because by the definition of
positive definite, whenever you

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18032-1
01:27:40.245 --> 01:27:43.132
have a which is nonzero, why
transpose Y should be more than

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18032-2
01:27:43.132 --> 01:27:43.227
0.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18052-0
01:27:43.717 --> 01:27:46.187
But here you are getting Y
transpose away to be equal to 0

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18052-1
01:27:46.187 --> 01:27:47.317
which is a condition right?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18056-0
01:27:47.887 --> 01:27:48.087
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18075-0
01:27:48.837 --> 01:27:52.323
So I cannot have any nonzero
element in null space or null

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18075-1
01:27:52.323 --> 01:27:53.977
space are in contain only 0.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18077-0
01:27:54.897 --> 01:27:55.137
Hmm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18090-0
01:27:56.847 --> 01:27:59.137
So I've been null space of a is
containing A0.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18099-0
01:27:59.147 --> 01:28:00.957
What is the dimension of
nullspace of a?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18104-0
01:28:03.267 --> 01:28:03.557
Deal.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18109-0
01:28:04.537 --> 01:28:04.737
Umm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18157-0
01:28:05.307 --> 01:28:10.338
Now apply the languid theorem
dimension of RA plus dimension

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18157-1
01:28:10.338 --> 01:28:15.205
of nice piece of year will be
equal to N Now this is zero,

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18136-0
01:28:14.457 --> 01:28:15.067
Zero.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18157-2
01:28:15.205 --> 01:28:19.907
which means dimension of out of
yeah will be equal to N.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18140-0
01:28:15.327 --> 01:28:15.667
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18149-0
01:28:15.857 --> 01:28:17.607
Yeah. Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18169-0
01:28:19.747 --> 01:28:21.907
And then yeah, all right, yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18165-0
01:28:20.037 --> 01:28:21.057
So yeah, has full drive.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18172-0
01:28:23.347 --> 01:28:23.807
Got it.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18173-0
01:28:24.307 --> 01:28:24.707
Yes, yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18177-0
01:28:26.417 --> 01:28:26.667
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18185-0
01:28:26.677 --> 01:28:29.697
APARNA Kritika, are you able to
digest this?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18190-0
01:28:32.057 --> 01:28:32.457
Yes, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18197-0
01:28:34.147 --> 01:28:34.347
His.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18204-0
01:28:34.357 --> 01:28:35.427
I don't know who is saying yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18216-0
01:28:36.617 --> 01:28:37.637
Good thing, good thing out.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18213-0
01:28:36.777 --> 01:28:37.167
That I'm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18226-0
01:28:38.107 --> 01:28:41.787
You are able to relate with the
angle theorem.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18234-0
01:28:41.797 --> 01:28:43.917
This concept external spose X
more than zero.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18253-0
01:28:45.447 --> 01:28:46.467
Yes, Sir, I got it.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18265-0
01:28:46.657 --> 01:28:48.297
It's you and I got it.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18251-0
01:28:46.997 --> 01:28:47.767
Ohh OK fine.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18271-0
01:28:47.777 --> 01:28:50.954
That is the reason I have that
that is the reason I had put it

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18271-1
01:28:50.954 --> 01:28:51.257
there.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18315-0
01:28:52.137 --> 01:28:55.454
OK, now there are lots and lots
of properties with respect to

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18315-1
01:28:55.454 --> 01:28:58.825
this symmetric positive definite
things and symmetric positive

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18315-2
01:28:58.825 --> 01:29:01.982
definite is the one which is
going to guide us through the

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18315-3
01:29:01.982 --> 01:29:03.427
machine learning algorithm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18329-0
01:29:03.437 --> 01:29:06.045
So I will be always talking
about this positive definite

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18329-1
01:29:06.045 --> 01:29:06.457
matrices.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18340-0
01:29:08.237 --> 01:29:10.447
Now there is something called a
canonical basis.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18349-0
01:29:10.457 --> 01:29:11.477
Maybe I will write it here.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18360-0
01:29:13.237 --> 01:29:15.737
The easiest to basis you can
write for RN.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18368-0
01:29:15.747 --> 01:29:17.347
This is the end dimensional
space.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18374-0
01:29:17.857 --> 01:29:18.847
Will be something like.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18383-0
01:29:18.857 --> 01:29:21.207
You start with 1000 everywhere.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18391-0
01:29:21.477 --> 01:29:23.827
Then you start with 01000.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18400-0
01:29:23.837 --> 01:29:25.317
This is called the canonical
basis.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18408-0
01:29:25.327 --> 01:29:26.407
It will have N elements.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18452-0
01:29:27.337 --> 01:29:31.870
This is the last element, so
this is typically called as an

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18452-1
01:29:31.870 --> 01:29:36.403
E1E2 and this is called the El
where EI is basically the IT

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18452-2
01:29:36.403 --> 01:29:40.407
position has an ID and all other
positions are high.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18471-0
01:29:40.417 --> 01:29:45.163
Position has a one was, he said
he has a one and all other

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18471-1
01:29:45.163 --> 01:29:47.737
positions are filled with zeros.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18478-0
01:29:48.927 --> 01:29:49.757
Now this is a basis.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18515-0
01:29:49.767 --> 01:29:53.001
You know that this is linearly
independent because if you put

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18515-1
01:29:53.001 --> 01:29:56.288
them in a in a in a factor in a
in a matrix form, you will get

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18515-2
01:29:56.288 --> 01:29:58.897
an identity matrix which is
already in RREF form.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18524-0
01:29:58.907 --> 01:30:00.227
So it is linearly independent.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18530-0
01:30:00.507 --> 01:30:01.757
It will span every element.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18543-0
01:30:01.767 --> 01:30:05.002
Every element can be written as
a linear combination of elements

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18543-1
01:30:05.002 --> 01:30:06.097
in this basis element.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18576-0
01:30:06.487 --> 01:30:07.477
Now this is EA.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18579-0
01:30:08.037 --> 01:30:14.863
Now if I matrix AN cross N is
positive definite, then I told

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18579-1
01:30:14.863 --> 01:30:21.017
you that any nonzero excel, uh
like that will satisfy.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18592-0
01:30:21.027 --> 01:30:23.927
It'll satisfy X transpose X is
more than 0, correct?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18606-0
01:30:24.607 --> 01:30:27.117
Yes, just now we have seen this.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18620-0
01:30:26.017 --> 01:30:31.987
Now, as a special case, you take
a EIX to be equal to EI.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18624-0
01:30:32.457 --> 01:30:33.957
Now is E equal to 0?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18639-0
01:30:36.187 --> 01:30:37.687
The age equal to 0 no.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18643-0
01:30:38.587 --> 01:30:39.837
A is not equal to 0.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18657-0
01:30:40.127 --> 01:30:43.697
Now if you do 8 transpose then
this would be 000.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18671-0
01:30:43.707 --> 01:30:46.837
The I eighth position will be
one and all others are zero.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18675-0
01:30:45.197 --> 01:30:45.657
And one.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18679-0
01:30:46.847 --> 01:30:48.037
This is the eighth position.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18685-0
01:30:48.417 --> 01:30:48.647
Umm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18686-0
01:30:48.427 --> 01:30:49.577
Then you have a.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18709-0
01:30:50.327 --> 01:30:55.449
Then you have a 0000 I get
position one and then all the

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18705-0
01:30:53.957 --> 01:30:54.557
Into one.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18709-1
01:30:55.449 --> 01:30:56.707
zeros correct.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18717-0
01:30:57.247 --> 01:30:57.437
Umm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18718-0
01:30:58.367 --> 01:30:59.467
Now, what do you get out of
this?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18738-0
01:31:01.617 --> 01:31:06.737
Meena, A, AE E.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18744-0
01:31:06.167 --> 01:31:09.145
No, if you if you multiply a
with this vector, what do you

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18744-1
01:31:09.145 --> 01:31:09.347
get?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18747-0
01:31:11.017 --> 01:31:11.097
E.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18758-0
01:31:13.247 --> 01:31:13.427
No.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18763-0
01:31:13.347 --> 01:31:14.497
I personally think.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18766-0
01:31:14.177 --> 01:31:16.077
Some value X I ^2.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18764-0
01:31:14.257 --> 01:31:15.367
111.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18773-0
01:31:17.927 --> 01:31:19.237
No, please think about it.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18779-0
01:31:19.247 --> 01:31:20.477
Not if you multiply.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18789-0
01:31:20.487 --> 01:31:21.457
Should I give an example?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18785-0
01:31:22.667 --> 01:31:23.017
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18787-0
01:31:23.027 --> 01:31:23.207
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18799-0
01:31:23.217 --> 01:31:23.937
Thank you, Sir please.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18810-0
01:31:23.457 --> 01:31:27.927
123456 uh 789.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18813-0
01:31:28.097 --> 01:31:28.307
Hmm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18822-0
01:31:28.477 --> 01:31:31.437
Let me take my E2010.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18833-0
01:31:31.267 --> 01:31:32.687
10, OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18836-0
01:31:32.467 --> 01:31:34.667
So what do you get if you
multiply this with this?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18855-0
01:31:36.407 --> 01:31:37.717
So I will get two.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18848-0
01:31:36.937 --> 01:31:37.257
Don't know.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18857-0
01:31:37.747 --> 01:31:41.527
Two second case, third case.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18858-0
01:31:38.467 --> 01:31:41.967
Yes, five eat.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18865-0
01:31:45.337 --> 01:31:46.767
Now what I want to multiply.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18905-0
01:31:48.557 --> 01:31:56.980
010 with 258 what do I get like
so if I take E2 it is 2 cross

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18874-0
01:31:50.597 --> 01:31:50.797
Umm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18882-0
01:31:53.187 --> 01:31:54.167
Umm 5.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18905-1
01:31:56.980 --> 01:32:00.377
two element here correct?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18909-0
01:32:01.527 --> 01:32:02.617
You twist it.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18921-0
01:32:02.627 --> 01:32:04.187
Twist too close to element, yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18922-0
01:32:05.287 --> 01:32:05.547
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18931-0
01:32:05.557 --> 01:32:07.117
If I take an E3, what I will
get?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18939-0
01:32:08.667 --> 01:32:09.157
9.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18937-0
01:32:09.857 --> 01:32:10.327
Nine.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18962-0
01:32:10.527 --> 01:32:13.837
911 yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18959-0
01:32:10.727 --> 01:32:12.787
If I get a event I will get a
one correct.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18973-0
01:32:14.527 --> 01:32:17.397
So if I do this, this is nothing
but Sai.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18969-0
01:32:14.547 --> 01:32:15.547
Like 1,000,000.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/18987-0
01:32:17.487 --> 01:32:20.477
You agree that I I I element of
a.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19002-0
01:32:21.617 --> 01:32:23.287
Uh, yes, yes, yes, very good,
yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19000-0
01:32:22.087 --> 01:32:22.237
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19001-0
01:32:22.597 --> 01:32:23.087
Yes, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19032-0
01:32:23.737 --> 01:32:30.922
Ikami, which in place which
implies that yeah, I I which is

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19014-0
01:32:25.307 --> 01:32:25.577
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19032-1
01:32:30.922 --> 01:32:33.317
the I8 element of a.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19074-0
01:32:33.327 --> 01:32:38.554
This is I comma I this is more
than zero for all like so if you

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19046-0
01:32:37.397 --> 01:32:38.087
That is true.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19053-0
01:32:38.137 --> 01:32:38.687
That is true.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19074-1
01:32:38.554 --> 01:32:42.800
have this is one of the
conditions we check for for

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19074-2
01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:47.047
positive definite test that is
what we are correct.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19082-0
01:32:48.337 --> 01:32:48.617
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19083-0
01:32:48.997 --> 01:32:50.617
That will entries are strictly
positive.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19088-0
01:32:53.167 --> 01:32:53.617
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19114-0
01:32:53.667 --> 01:32:58.600
Later on, we'll prove that even
the eigenvalues are positive,

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19114-1
01:32:58.600 --> 01:33:02.897
and you can have a you can have
a a thing, so if you.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19123-0
01:33:04.937 --> 01:33:07.167
I don't know kritika have you?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19129-0
01:33:07.477 --> 01:33:09.737
Have you seen this properties?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19136-0
01:33:11.487 --> 01:33:11.867
Yes, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19155-0
01:33:12.907 --> 01:33:18.327
Uh, if you have a matrix a,
let's say A3, by what?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19151-0
01:33:16.387 --> 01:33:17.147
Diagonal interest.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19161-0
01:33:19.817 --> 01:33:20.627
Diagonal entries?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19169-0
01:33:20.637 --> 01:33:20.967
No Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19171-0
01:33:21.397 --> 01:33:22.467
Not actually entries, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19186-0
01:33:22.877 --> 01:33:25.727
You can also have this is say
A11.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19189-0
01:33:25.737 --> 01:33:26.827
This is a 12.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19213-0
01:33:26.837 --> 01:33:35.047
This is a 13A21A22A23A31A32A33.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19215-0
01:33:35.407 --> 01:33:36.527
Now if you have.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19226-0
01:33:38.427 --> 01:33:40.437
This element will be more than
0.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19246-0
01:33:40.727 --> 01:33:43.289
The determinant of this matrix
is more than zero and the

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19246-1
01:33:43.289 --> 01:33:45.357
determinant of this matrix is
more than zero.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19255-0
01:33:45.367 --> 01:33:48.177
All of them are more than zero
then a possibility.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19264-0
01:33:52.357 --> 01:33:52.917
That is true.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19267-0
01:33:53.657 --> 01:33:55.987
Sir, what was the 2nd sentence
then?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19275-0
01:33:55.997 --> 01:33:56.667
A is.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19278-0
01:33:57.567 --> 01:33:58.967
Then the is positive definite.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19292-0
01:34:03.057 --> 01:34:04.727
A11 is more than 0.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19296-0
01:34:05.827 --> 01:34:07.347
The determinant of A11.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19305-0
01:34:09.707 --> 01:34:11.567
The determinant of a one one.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19332-0
01:34:13.107 --> 01:34:18.216
Yeah, I want to A1A22 is more
than 0 determinant and

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19332-1
01:34:18.216 --> 01:34:21.687
determinant of A is more than
zero.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19339-0
01:34:21.937 --> 01:34:24.257
If these three are true, then
you have.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19348-0
01:34:24.707 --> 01:34:27.447
Yeah, to be a positive definite
matrix. OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19355-0
01:34:29.377 --> 01:34:29.717
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19359-0
01:34:30.387 --> 01:34:32.427
This is a characterization of
positive definite matrices.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19365-0
01:34:35.507 --> 01:34:35.867
You die.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19374-0
01:34:35.877 --> 01:34:37.197
You can values are all positive.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19382-0
01:34:37.207 --> 01:34:38.427
Then it is positive definite.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19396-0
01:34:38.437 --> 01:34:41.029
That is also his condition,
which you can which I will tell

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19396-1
01:34:41.029 --> 01:34:41.677
the next class.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19402-0
01:34:43.807 --> 01:34:44.437
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19421-0
01:34:44.507 --> 01:34:48.477
So in that products and norms
are very closely related in that

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19421-1
01:34:48.477 --> 01:34:49.927
product of two numbers.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19437-0
01:34:50.317 --> 01:34:55.107
And if you take the dot product
of two then it is norm of X.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19442-0
01:34:55.537 --> 01:34:57.017
So you can do this.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19459-0
01:34:58.957 --> 01:35:02.907
Uh ** and square root and they
defend it to be the norm of X.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19477-0
01:35:02.977 --> 01:35:08.678
It satisfy all the property, not
every norm is induced by an

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19477-1
01:35:08.678 --> 01:35:09.987
inner product.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19488-0
01:35:11.107 --> 01:35:13.917
OK, now what are the properties
of norm you should do?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19497-0
01:35:18.577 --> 01:35:19.897
What are the properties of norm?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19506-0
01:35:22.567 --> 01:35:24.137
And Norm is more than 0 correct.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19516-0
01:35:26.607 --> 01:35:26.827
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19519-0
01:35:27.477 --> 01:35:28.987
Client should not equal to 0.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19576-0
01:35:30.477 --> 01:35:34.894
Whenever X is equal to 0, norm
of X will be equal to 0 and norm

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19576-1
01:35:34.894 --> 01:35:39.036
of Lambda X will be equal to
Lambda times normal mod Lambda

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19576-2
01:35:39.036 --> 01:35:43.591
times norm of X and then norm of
X + y will be less than equal to

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19576-3
01:35:43.591 --> 01:35:45.317
norm of X plus norm of X.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19585-0
01:35:45.327 --> 01:35:46.847
We should satisfy all these
things.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19607-0
01:35:47.567 --> 01:35:51.838
OK, if there is an inner
product, the inner product will

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19600-0
01:35:49.827 --> 01:35:50.207
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19607-1
01:35:51.838 --> 01:35:52.887
induce a norm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19622-0
01:35:52.897 --> 01:35:57.247
For example, this ** is there so
this will induce a norm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19637-0
01:35:57.417 --> 01:36:01.469
So if you do this operation
inner part of X with X, it'll

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19637-1
01:36:01.469 --> 01:36:02.447
induce a norm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19659-0
01:36:02.837 --> 01:36:06.701
Now this is a very special case,
but not all norms have a

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19659-1
01:36:06.701 --> 01:36:08.567
corresponding inner product.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19668-0
01:36:08.577 --> 01:36:10.097
So one example is a Manhattan.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19709-0
01:36:10.107 --> 01:36:13.348
Now you can also have something
called as a Cauchy Schwarz

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19709-1
01:36:13.348 --> 01:36:16.700
inequality, where you say that
X&amp;Y the inner quantity is

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19709-2
01:36:16.700 --> 01:36:19.227
less than equal to norm of X
times norm of Y.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19721-0
01:36:20.157 --> 01:36:22.497
Now we can have a proof of this,
the.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19736-0
01:36:23.237 --> 01:36:28.994
Yeah, but we need to have a
little bit of algebra for for

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19736-1
01:36:28.994 --> 01:36:29.887
that now.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19745-0
01:36:30.267 --> 01:36:31.307
Hey, you are there with me.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19751-0
01:36:32.247 --> 01:36:33.867
I yes VENKITESWARAN there.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19748-0
01:36:33.477 --> 01:36:33.757
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19772-0
01:36:34.757 --> 01:36:37.397
OK, only you are there or
somebody else is also there.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19770-0
01:36:37.507 --> 01:36:38.937
So that only few are with you.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19786-0
01:36:38.947 --> 01:36:41.437
I mean, I think this is we very
frank with you, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19803-0
01:36:41.447 --> 01:36:43.967
It's going for where few of
things so.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19799-0
01:36:43.507 --> 01:36:44.477
Which one is going?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19824-0
01:36:44.827 --> 01:36:48.437
I I agree, I agree.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19832-0
01:36:44.847 --> 01:36:48.607
I see that the purpose of you
agree with whom?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19826-0
01:36:47.787 --> 01:36:49.057
I'm not sure that I'm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19848-0
01:36:48.767 --> 01:36:52.750
Maybe maybe this is, you know,
going too fast for me as well,

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19846-0
01:36:49.067 --> 01:36:51.157
I'm very frank, like, but it's
going, yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19848-1
01:36:52.750 --> 01:36:53.007
Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19888-0
01:36:54.057 --> 01:36:57.739
I have probably you know I I got
lost somewhere in between and

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19858-0
01:36:54.887 --> 01:36:55.257
Ohh.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19888-1
01:36:57.739 --> 01:37:01.188
I'm not sure if I would be able
to catch up this class now

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19888-2
01:37:01.188 --> 01:37:02.357
during this session.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19886-0
01:37:02.677 --> 01:37:03.787
Same with me, Sir. I'm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19901-0
01:37:03.837 --> 01:37:06.247
I if you are observing the
people are dropping also.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19922-0
01:37:06.257 --> 01:37:09.756
I mean, just because I'm not
sure if not getting or what, but

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19922-1
01:37:09.756 --> 01:37:11.167
it's really going beyond.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19921-0
01:37:10.287 --> 01:37:10.937
The purpose of.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19974-0
01:37:13.987 --> 01:37:17.443
So, Sir, if we even cover less,
but at least we understand is

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19974-1
01:37:17.443 --> 01:37:20.955
more beneficial for all of us, I
I can see like few of us are,

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19974-2
01:37:20.955 --> 01:37:24.243
maybe explored and they're
getting a lot of things but not

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19965-0
01:37:21.147 --> 01:37:21.497
It.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19974-3
01:37:24.243 --> 01:37:25.247
of all, all of us.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19996-0
01:37:27.297 --> 01:37:29.707
And if you take the percentage
of people, it would be very less

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/19996-1
01:37:29.707 --> 01:37:30.987
who are understanding
everything.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20002-0
01:37:31.457 --> 01:37:32.667
We can take the vote if we want.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20024-0
01:37:35.137 --> 01:37:36.647
I don't know what to say.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20045-0
01:37:35.237 --> 01:37:39.627
So you your way of explaining is
really good, but not yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20036-0
01:37:36.997 --> 01:37:38.947
Once, once, once, once, once,
once.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20066-0
01:37:39.017 --> 01:37:41.923
Let me let me let me let me
reiterate the purpose of

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20066-1
01:37:41.923 --> 01:37:45.378
enabling MIC itself was to raise
your hand when things are not

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20066-2
01:37:45.378 --> 01:37:45.707
clear.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20084-0
01:37:47.027 --> 01:37:50.848
When people are very silent, I
tend to assume that you have

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20084-1
01:37:50.848 --> 01:37:52.377
understood these things.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20094-0
01:37:52.607 --> 01:37:54.717
Now, where is it that you have
not understood?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20112-0
01:37:54.727 --> 01:37:58.015
So you should raise your hand
immediately and say that this

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20112-1
01:37:58.015 --> 01:38:00.097
step requires some other
explanation.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20118-0
01:38:00.107 --> 01:38:02.777
You please explain this now.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20143-0
01:38:02.787 --> 01:38:05.742
I don't blame you, but you
cannot completely say now I lost

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20143-1
01:38:05.742 --> 01:38:08.107
somewhere and then that
somewhere is undefined.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20141-0
01:38:07.457 --> 01:38:09.247
But yeah, yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20161-0
01:38:09.257 --> 01:38:13.208
So I think the problem is that
there are so many concepts here

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20161-1
01:38:13.208 --> 01:38:15.717
and each of the concept needs
practice.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20177-0
01:38:15.877 --> 01:38:20.247
So I am hitting most of these
terms for the very first time.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20191-0
01:38:20.297 --> 01:38:22.717
I did not do that in my
engineering.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20187-0
01:38:20.767 --> 01:38:21.107
Hmm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20226-0
01:38:23.777 --> 01:38:27.763
Now when I'm hearing them, and
if we just spend a minute and

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20226-1
01:38:27.763 --> 01:38:31.945
move forward to the next slide,
I would not be able to remember

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20226-2
01:38:31.945 --> 01:38:34.297
that definition after three
slides.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20248-0
01:38:35.227 --> 01:38:38.505
And then if you are using that
in another definition, so this

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20248-1
01:38:38.505 --> 01:38:40.197
is the problem that I am facing.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20250-0
01:38:40.377 --> 01:38:40.737
Maybe.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20259-0
01:38:40.727 --> 01:38:40.877
You.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20268-0
01:38:40.747 --> 01:38:43.007
I'm not sure if others are also
in the same boat or not.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20269-0
01:38:42.817 --> 01:38:44.187
Alright, OK, I understand this.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20299-0
01:38:44.197 --> 01:38:50.119
So I had to turn it down saying
that if you go to your team's

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20299-1
01:38:50.119 --> 01:38:56.137
account, my TEAMS post all these
materials well ahead of time.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20314-0
01:38:56.487 --> 01:39:00.487
So for example, if you see in
the in the general category.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20323-0
01:39:01.637 --> 01:39:04.207
And you can you can.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20359-0
01:39:04.217 --> 01:39:08.500
You can you can see the notes
and when you go to Canvas page

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20359-1
01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:12.501
in canvas page you can find the
the LECTURES uploaded by

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20359-2
01:39:12.501 --> 01:39:16.644
Tuesday, Tuesday, Wednesday of
every week for the upcoming

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20359-3
01:39:16.644 --> 01:39:17.697
Saturday class.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20362-0
01:39:17.787 --> 01:39:18.217
Agreed.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20385-0
01:39:19.407 --> 01:39:21.277
Have you found that or should I
show that you know?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20397-0
01:39:22.417 --> 01:39:23.717
Able to found itself.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20387-0
01:39:22.447 --> 01:39:22.737
No, no.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20396-0
01:39:22.747 --> 01:39:23.507
We can find that.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20401-0
01:39:23.887 --> 01:39:24.057
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20404-0
01:39:23.897 --> 01:39:24.597
You can find her.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20417-0
01:39:25.867 --> 01:39:28.677
Can't find it we can able to
find it Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20409-0
01:39:25.997 --> 01:39:26.177
What?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20421-0
01:39:29.347 --> 01:39:31.397
So did you go through that?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20437-0
01:39:31.407 --> 01:39:34.636
So if you just go through those
twenty that is slides, you'll

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20437-1
01:39:34.636 --> 01:39:34.897
know.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20465-0
01:39:35.027 --> 01:39:38.117
So in the upcoming class on
Saturday, maybe you spend half

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20465-1
01:39:38.117 --> 01:39:41.417
an hour, you need inner product,
you need something like this.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20476-0
01:39:41.427 --> 01:39:43.387
You need this so these are the
four concepts.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20494-0
01:39:43.727 --> 01:39:48.537
If you prepare little one page
note also then it will be nice.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20506-0
01:39:49.577 --> 01:39:52.877
Now, while I can't blame but the
machine learning doesn't.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20529-0
01:39:52.887 --> 01:39:56.150
Uh, you know, doesn't spare any
of these topics, so I am unable

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20529-1
01:39:56.150 --> 01:39:57.527
to cut down on any of them.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20536-0
01:39:57.727 --> 01:39:58.907
I can go a little slow.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20561-0
01:39:58.917 --> 01:40:03.658
So you indicate to me whenever I
am crossing my my my threshold

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20561-1
01:40:03.658 --> 01:40:06.547
and I'll be able to explain it
better.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20599-0
01:40:06.917 --> 01:40:10.461
Now I don't want you to to have
too much memory, but then

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20599-1
01:40:10.461 --> 01:40:14.005
wherever you are finding it
difficult, you tell me the so

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20599-2
01:40:14.005 --> 01:40:16.327
that I can work out some other
thing.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20612-0
01:40:16.457 --> 01:40:19.847
That's how we worked out the tea
example on the coffee example.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20624-0
01:40:20.487 --> 01:40:22.437
Now those things can be worked
out here also.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20635-0
01:40:22.747 --> 01:40:25.367
So you tell me where is it that
I should start now?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20652-0
01:40:27.317 --> 01:40:28.387
We have 15 minutes of that.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20682-0
01:40:27.377 --> 01:40:30.772
So for every concept you can
give for every concept, you can

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20682-1
01:40:30.772 --> 01:40:34.278
give examples like you explained
tea and coffee to most people

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20682-2
01:40:34.278 --> 01:40:37.728
can relate and then you know
understand because everything is

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20682-3
01:40:37.728 --> 01:40:38.897
new to people, right?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20704-0
01:40:41.997 --> 01:40:44.087
So examples would help that that
was my point.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20694-0
01:40:42.307 --> 01:40:42.707
No, but.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20699-0
01:40:44.787 --> 01:40:45.127
I think bye.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20702-0
01:40:45.137 --> 01:40:45.477
Bye.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20712-0
01:40:45.527 --> 01:40:46.857
I am ready to give examples.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20721-0
01:40:46.867 --> 01:40:48.677
My 1D point is where should I
start from?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20747-0
01:40:52.737 --> 01:40:56.776
So Sir, you explained couple of
times like basis you explained

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20779-0
01:40:52.747 --> 01:40:53.117
Umm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20741-0
01:40:55.637 --> 01:40:56.287
So Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20747-1
01:40:56.776 --> 01:40:57.097
null.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20767-0
01:40:58.627 --> 01:41:00.217
So if you can give me something.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20765-0
01:40:58.697 --> 01:41:00.847
So for example, we can start
that norm, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20770-0
01:41:00.857 --> 01:41:01.667
The norm, Sir?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20778-0
01:41:02.557 --> 01:41:04.257
From there we can have some
examples.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20777-0
01:41:02.867 --> 01:41:03.047
Yep.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20786-0
01:41:06.097 --> 01:41:09.257
OK, so you don't understand
norms.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20801-0
01:41:13.497 --> 01:41:13.817
Yes, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20813-0
01:41:13.797 --> 01:41:15.677
I'm asking you, do you don't
understand norms or?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20805-0
01:41:14.137 --> 01:41:14.427
And.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20814-0
01:41:14.937 --> 01:41:16.447
Yes, yes, right, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20809-0
01:41:16.007 --> 01:41:16.677
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20815-0
01:41:16.687 --> 01:41:17.327
No, Sir, no Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20905-0
01:41:20.467 --> 01:41:24.498
So actually when when they when
you have posted at the PPT,

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20905-1
01:41:24.498 --> 01:41:28.664
that's the first time seeing of
the norms itself, because I'm

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20905-2
01:41:28.664 --> 01:41:32.695
from the non the engineering
type of stuff most I'm able to

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20905-3
01:41:32.695 --> 01:41:36.861
get with the matrix and stuff
which is able to understand the

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20905-4
01:41:36.861 --> 01:41:40.825
certain things which I have to
spend at least two to three

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20905-5
01:41:40.825 --> 01:41:44.923
hours of time or for you to get
for me to at least listen to

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20905-6
01:41:44.923 --> 01:41:45.797
your classes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20971-0
01:41:45.807 --> 01:41:49.848
That's why I'm start preparing,
but the most of the people who

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20971-1
01:41:49.848 --> 01:41:53.889
aren't able to get that kind of
investment in time because for

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20971-2
01:41:53.889 --> 01:41:58.059
the classes which we have taken
for the certain stuff, I have to

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20971-3
01:41:58.059 --> 01:42:02.165
spend, I have spent it at least
two to three hours on nights to

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20971-4
01:42:02.165 --> 01:42:05.757
get some something so I can have
put up some questions.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/20983-0
01:42:07.917 --> 01:42:09.827
Most peoples weren't able to get
this stuff.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21006-0
01:42:10.997 --> 01:42:14.412
But I I see there was more than
20 years of experience, peoples

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21006-1
01:42:14.412 --> 01:42:16.067
are actually they weren't even.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21012-0
01:42:16.317 --> 01:42:17.297
I remember matrix.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21030-0
01:42:18.167 --> 01:42:23.559
That's I I very appreciate you
have actually sending this PPT

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21030-1
01:42:23.559 --> 01:42:25.647
ahead so we can prepare.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21037-0
01:42:25.657 --> 01:42:28.077
That's the only think.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21055-0
01:42:28.087 --> 01:42:33.007
So you know you can see that was
141 people's only on the call.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21090-0
01:42:35.417 --> 01:42:38.364
No matter how many examples he
gives right without homework,

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21090-1
01:42:38.364 --> 01:42:40.877
people are not going to be able
to catch up, right?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21114-0
01:42:41.027 --> 01:42:43.097
OK, let me let us some waste
time at least.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21113-0
01:42:41.677 --> 01:42:42.627
So that's just accept.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21100-0
01:42:41.697 --> 01:42:42.017
It.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21120-0
01:42:42.057 --> 01:42:42.937
Yes, that's for sure.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21118-0
01:42:43.567 --> 01:42:44.157
At least let.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21134-0
01:42:44.607 --> 01:42:47.677
Let us let us let us let us
spend some time.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21138-0
01:42:47.687 --> 01:42:48.797
Since you told me something.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21142-0
01:42:51.307 --> 01:42:51.917
Tea.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21151-0
01:42:52.407 --> 01:42:53.507
Suppose suppose.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21145-0
01:42:52.877 --> 01:42:53.567
What?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21147-0
01:42:53.617 --> 01:42:54.147
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21152-0
01:42:54.157 --> 01:42:54.567
Sorry.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21156-0
01:42:54.617 --> 01:42:55.687
Sorry to interrupt us.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21191-0
01:42:55.697 --> 01:43:01.323
SO11 best thing what we could do
is let's take a take a backward

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21167-0
01:42:56.027 --> 01:42:56.277
Umm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21191-1
01:43:01.323 --> 01:43:03.487
or like a call if you're.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21229-0
01:43:03.537 --> 01:43:06.945
If you're teaching me in the
classes, you are at least you

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21229-1
01:43:06.945 --> 01:43:10.469
give two to three work nodes
which we can work on that basis

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21229-2
01:43:10.469 --> 01:43:13.647
because that makes you peoples
to at least try for it.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21244-0
01:43:15.187 --> 01:43:17.977
So for each and every norm that
was exercised there.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21276-0
01:43:17.987 --> 01:43:24.550
But if you have a provide some,
make some simple questions or or

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21276-1
01:43:24.550 --> 01:43:30.810
exercises, but just which which
is very easy and the solvable

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21276-2
01:43:30.810 --> 01:43:31.517
for me.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21286-0
01:43:31.527 --> 01:43:35.177
For them, it makes a positive
feel that they can solve it.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21309-0
01:43:37.177 --> 01:43:39.834
That is the only thing if you
are taking a norm actually

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21303-0
01:43:37.407 --> 01:43:37.687
Hmm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21309-1
01:43:39.834 --> 01:43:40.207
present.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21328-0
01:43:40.217 --> 01:43:45.463
If you give a simple like a two
to two matrix, how to solve this

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21328-1
01:43:45.463 --> 01:43:45.947
stuff?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21377-0
01:43:46.637 --> 01:43:50.661
Starting a new concept, if you
give you exercise to them, they

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21377-1
01:43:50.661 --> 01:43:54.684
will feel proud that they will
solving it when you're going on

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21377-2
01:43:54.684 --> 01:43:58.389
4 into 4-5 into five that kind
of day they can boost some

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21377-3
01:43:58.389 --> 01:44:01.327
confident enough for them, they
can solve it.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21403-0
01:44:01.437 --> 01:44:04.067
That's the only thing because
most people dropping the call.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21389-0
01:44:03.027 --> 01:44:03.247
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21398-0
01:44:03.257 --> 01:44:04.617
Bye bye Neil.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21408-0
01:44:04.867 --> 01:44:05.587
What is your name?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21411-0
01:44:05.247 --> 01:44:07.217
Yes, I'm Lakshmi azar.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21419-0
01:44:08.067 --> 01:44:11.207
Lakshman, I have only one
comment on this.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21422-0
01:44:13.177 --> 01:44:13.447
This.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21423-0
01:44:14.197 --> 01:44:14.557
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21435-0
01:44:16.507 --> 01:44:18.037
I have only one comment.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21456-0
01:44:17.597 --> 01:44:17.747
No.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21476-0
01:44:18.147 --> 01:44:22.312
The point is you have enrolled
for a course on data science and

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21476-1
01:44:22.312 --> 01:44:26.607
I have been given this Herculean
task that you will be ready with

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21476-2
01:44:26.607 --> 01:44:30.511
machine learning concepts and
whatever math is required for

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21476-3
01:44:30.511 --> 01:44:30.837
that.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21501-0
01:44:32.007 --> 01:44:35.452
While I can certainly do a two
by two matrix, but my data is of

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21501-1
01:44:35.452 --> 01:44:37.497
the order of 1,000,000 cross
hundred.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21517-0
01:44:38.617 --> 01:44:42.512
I have already shown you in
image processing how this data

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21508-0
01:44:38.647 --> 01:44:38.857
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21517-1
01:44:42.512 --> 01:44:43.767
is getting popular.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21542-0
01:44:43.777 --> 01:44:47.152
I don't know whether you are
there for the class or not,

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21548-0
01:44:45.867 --> 01:44:47.907
Yes, I'm impressed with the
demos though.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21542-1
01:44:47.152 --> 01:44:47.507
right?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21544-0
01:44:48.177 --> 01:44:48.617
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21562-0
01:44:48.657 --> 01:44:52.627
So, but the point is we have to
catch up at some point.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21582-0
01:44:52.677 --> 01:44:56.789
And if you don't have time, I am
just asking you saying that I

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21582-1
01:44:56.789 --> 01:44:58.747
will try to take up that time.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21604-0
01:44:59.077 --> 01:45:02.602
So next week I know that I need
little more time to get the

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21604-1
01:45:02.602 --> 01:45:04.717
eigenvalues, eigenvectors
etcetera.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21631-0
01:45:05.137 --> 01:45:10.034
I always and requested students
to be a little more and

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21615-0
01:45:07.657 --> 01:45:07.837
No.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21631-1
01:45:10.034 --> 01:45:14.407
attentive and give their
feedback then and there.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21657-0
01:45:15.357 --> 01:45:18.083
Now that you've told me that
you're not understood norms, I

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21657-1
01:45:18.083 --> 01:45:20.127
will tell you what is the
concept of a norm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21668-0
01:45:20.637 --> 01:45:23.187
So let's not waste anytime
further now.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21677-0
01:45:23.237 --> 01:45:25.167
Henceforth, I will not wait for
these things.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21694-0
01:45:25.177 --> 01:45:29.626
You cannot keep sitting and then
say, Sir, what is this true 2-3

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21694-1
01:45:29.626 --> 01:45:30.037
comma?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21701-0
01:45:30.047 --> 01:45:31.977
Eight, I don't understand
anything.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21728-0
01:45:31.987 --> 01:45:35.164
We have crossed that stage long
back, so whenever it is there

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21722-0
01:45:34.267 --> 01:45:34.747
Is in.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21728-1
01:45:35.164 --> 01:45:37.367
even for a single student, you
you please.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21736-0
01:45:37.657 --> 01:45:39.637
That's the reason that I unmute
everybody.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21744-0
01:45:40.517 --> 01:45:42.507
The first thing I do used to
unmute everybody.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21753-0
01:45:42.737 --> 01:45:45.127
You should make use of that
opportunity.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21769-0
01:45:45.397 --> 01:45:47.897
Tika doesn't matter, so I'm
going to tell you something

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21768-0
01:45:46.597 --> 01:45:46.907
Fine.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21769-1
01:45:47.897 --> 01:45:48.477
called norms.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21779-0
01:45:51.217 --> 01:45:52.817
I have a wood.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21790-0
01:45:54.007 --> 01:45:56.387
If I have to measure the length
of a wood, what do I do?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21824-0
01:46:00.717 --> 01:46:04.487
You have to know that the
height, the vector of bed

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21828-0
01:46:02.777 --> 01:46:06.847
Next one next X1X2, then X 1 -,
X two so.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21826-0
01:46:04.347 --> 01:46:04.907
Very simple.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21824-1
01:46:04.487 --> 01:46:05.067
tonight.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21833-0
01:46:08.217 --> 01:46:10.017
No, you.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21841-0
01:46:10.057 --> 01:46:11.467
This is what I don't know.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21863-0
01:46:11.477 --> 01:46:14.945
You people get things very
complicated and this is what

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21863-1
01:46:14.945 --> 01:46:17.917
people do in their doctor's
clinic also or not.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21887-0
01:46:18.377 --> 01:46:22.118
They have a high high scale so
they place is wooden log

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21887-1
01:46:22.118 --> 01:46:25.927
somewhere here and then they
read out this body correct?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21896-0
01:46:28.687 --> 01:46:28.917
Is.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21907-0
01:46:29.507 --> 01:46:29.927
Yes, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21910-0
01:46:30.237 --> 01:46:30.857
Yes, yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21917-0
01:46:30.377 --> 01:46:33.977
OK, now imagine can the length.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21912-0
01:46:30.707 --> 01:46:31.087
Yes, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21916-0
01:46:31.737 --> 01:46:31.937
Yep.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21927-0
01:46:36.057 --> 01:46:40.517
Of any law X be less than 0.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21934-0
01:46:41.967 --> 01:46:42.117
No.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21931-0
01:46:42.987 --> 01:46:43.357
No.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21939-0
01:46:43.027 --> 01:46:43.227
No.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21944-0
01:46:43.427 --> 01:46:45.717
So it is greater than zero.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21966-0
01:46:45.967 --> 01:46:50.754
Now length of a wooden log equal
to 0 implies there is no log

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21966-1
01:46:50.754 --> 01:46:51.217
right.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21969-0
01:46:51.867 --> 01:46:53.177
Well, yes, yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21967-0
01:46:52.717 --> 01:46:52.817
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21968-0
01:46:52.937 --> 01:46:53.087
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21975-0
01:46:54.747 --> 01:46:55.007
Agree.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21976-0
01:46:56.417 --> 01:46:56.707
Yes, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21977-0
01:46:56.537 --> 01:46:56.937
Agreed.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22008-0
01:46:57.787 --> 01:47:04.901
OK, now if you have length of X
+ Y, this will always be less

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21988-0
01:46:58.017 --> 01:46:58.477
Is her.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/21986-0
01:46:58.037 --> 01:46:58.177
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22008-1
01:47:04.901 --> 01:47:09.377
than length of X plus length of
right.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22025-0
01:47:11.867 --> 01:47:15.117
Now these are basically the
three properties which I'm going

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22025-1
01:47:15.117 --> 01:47:15.757
to tell you.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22032-0
01:47:15.857 --> 01:47:17.827
The third is called a triangle
inequality.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22047-0
01:47:21.567 --> 01:47:24.497
And this length function should
satisfy everything.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22093-0
01:47:24.507 --> 01:47:27.496
This length is actually only
called as a norm in higher

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22093-1
01:47:27.496 --> 01:47:30.753
dimension set, so in higher
dimensions I called something as

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22093-2
01:47:30.753 --> 01:47:34.116
a norm and then say norm of X is
some quantity which is always

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22093-3
01:47:34.116 --> 01:47:34.917
more than zero.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22127-0
01:47:36.347 --> 01:47:43.139
So again, norm of X equal to 0
implies X equal to zero 30s Tom

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22127-1
01:47:43.139 --> 01:47:49.607
of X + y is less than or equal
to norm of X plus norm of Y.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22135-0
01:47:50.357 --> 01:47:52.517
Now for all X comma, Y.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22144-0
01:47:53.277 --> 01:47:55.057
Now these are the three
properties of the norms.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22154-0
01:47:55.907 --> 01:47:58.177
Now I will give you some
examples of knobs.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22174-0
01:47:58.237 --> 01:48:01.887
So one is I have a non X.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22164-0
01:48:00.387 --> 01:48:00.857
But what?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22176-0
01:48:01.097 --> 01:48:02.027
So what is why you here?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22179-0
01:48:03.227 --> 01:48:04.447
Why is another blog?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22194-0
01:48:07.227 --> 01:48:09.957
So is there any difference
between norms and modulus?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22216-0
01:48:09.967 --> 01:48:13.109
Because the we we know the same
property with the modulus as

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22216-1
01:48:13.109 --> 01:48:13.367
well.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22207-0
01:48:13.647 --> 01:48:14.117
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22230-0
01:48:14.127 --> 01:48:17.211
So I'm gonna give you that only
as now norm of X in the

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22230-1
01:48:17.211 --> 01:48:18.037
Manhattan norm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22239-0
01:48:18.507 --> 01:48:20.777
Now this is what is norm of 1.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22279-0
01:48:20.787 --> 01:48:24.750
This is nothing but you take
some of all the X's, the

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22279-1
01:48:24.750 --> 01:48:29.153
components I equal to 1 to him
where your ex is nothing but

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22279-2
01:48:29.153 --> 01:48:29.887
X1X2 to X.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22282-0
01:48:29.937 --> 01:48:33.487
X2 to X so for example.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22343-0
01:48:35.967 --> 01:48:41.611
If X is nothing but one minus
1207, then norm of X in the one

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22343-1
01:48:41.611 --> 01:48:47.165
norm is nothing but Sigma I
equal to 1 to N norm of X, which

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22343-2
01:48:47.165 --> 01:48:52.718
is equal to 1 + 1 of minus one
plus mod of two plus mod of 0

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22343-3
01:48:52.718 --> 01:48:54.357
plus mod of seven.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22360-0
01:48:54.997 --> 01:49:00.187
This is 1 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 7 which
is equal to 11. Agree.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22368-0
01:49:03.197 --> 01:49:04.477
So can you repeat again?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22380-0
01:49:04.627 --> 01:49:06.597
Uh, just normal fix again.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22396-0
01:49:07.517 --> 01:49:09.946
Yeah, you take the sum of
absolute values of all the

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22396-1
01:49:09.946 --> 01:49:11.687
components of X in higher
dimensions.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22404-0
01:49:15.897 --> 01:49:16.177
Right.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22411-0
01:49:17.417 --> 01:49:18.767
Well, you were an example.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22472-0
01:49:18.777 --> 01:49:23.240
If the X is 1 -, 1, two, 07, the
norm of X1 for this X is nothing

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22472-1
01:49:23.240 --> 01:49:27.365
but mod of 1 plus mod of minus
one plus mod of 0 plus mod of

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22472-2
01:49:27.365 --> 01:49:31.558
two plus mod of 0 plus mod of
seven, which is 1 + 1 + 2 + 0 +

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22472-3
01:49:31.558 --> 01:49:33.587
7 which is equal to 11. Agree.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22495-0
01:49:36.197 --> 01:49:38.387
Well, the minus one become plus
one here and one.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22489-0
01:49:37.097 --> 01:49:37.357
Right.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22496-0
01:49:38.057 --> 01:49:38.657
Yes, I am.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22498-0
01:49:38.917 --> 01:49:40.187
Because it's an absolute value.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22499-0
01:49:41.487 --> 01:49:41.667
No.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22505-0
01:49:44.067 --> 01:49:44.647
Agreed, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22521-0
01:49:45.197 --> 01:49:48.656
OK, OK, Now I have to prove that
this satisfies all the

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22521-1
01:49:48.656 --> 01:49:50.757
properties listed above,
correct?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22528-0
01:49:52.957 --> 01:49:53.407
Solutely.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22564-0
01:49:54.447 --> 01:49:59.720
OK, so I will talk about the
first property first property

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22564-1
01:49:59.720 --> 01:50:05.262
now norm of X1 is nothing but
Sigma I equal to 1 to North mod

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22564-2
01:50:05.262 --> 01:50:05.977
of exit.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22583-0
01:50:06.267 --> 01:50:09.213
You know mod is always a
positive function, so some of

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22571-0
01:50:06.277 --> 01:50:06.907
Wanna fix it?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22583-1
01:50:09.213 --> 01:50:11.677
all positive numbers will not be
more than 0.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22587-0
01:50:14.237 --> 01:50:14.397
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22588-0
01:50:14.287 --> 01:50:14.467
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22600-0
01:50:15.527 --> 01:50:15.787
Right.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22606-0
01:50:16.417 --> 01:50:18.757
So what's first property
satisfied second property?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22603-0
01:50:16.467 --> 01:50:16.927
Yes, yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22619-0
01:50:19.887 --> 01:50:22.977
Let's say norm of X1 is equal to
0, which implies.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22644-0
01:50:25.647 --> 01:50:29.435
Marta Vixen Plus mode of X2 plus
all the day of two mod of Exxon

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22644-1
01:50:29.435 --> 01:50:31.067
will be equal to 0, correct?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22650-0
01:50:32.347 --> 01:50:32.447
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22653-0
01:50:32.777 --> 01:50:33.267
And.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22674-0
01:50:33.977 --> 01:50:37.974
Now this will imply how can the
sum of N positive numbers B

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22674-1
01:50:37.974 --> 01:50:38.707
equal to 0.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22694-0
01:50:39.677 --> 01:50:41.247
And all the values will would be
0.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22736-0
01:50:41.307 --> 01:50:41.507
So.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22738-0
01:50:41.307 --> 01:50:43.087
Well, I said I either.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22756-0
01:50:42.487 --> 01:50:46.076
X1 is equal to 0 or X2 is equal
to 0 up to X and equal to 0

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22756-1
01:50:46.076 --> 01:50:49.067
correct which implies exceeds
will be equal to 0.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22754-0
01:50:46.097 --> 01:50:47.817
Looks into school correct Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22752-0
01:50:47.027 --> 01:50:47.207
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22753-0
01:50:47.517 --> 01:50:47.637
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22758-0
01:50:50.357 --> 01:50:50.517
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22760-0
01:50:51.037 --> 01:50:51.167
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22770-0
01:50:52.697 --> 01:50:53.777
Second property satisfied.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22767-0
01:50:54.777 --> 01:50:54.907
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22776-0
01:50:55.577 --> 01:50:58.117
So now I will take norm of.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22773-0
01:50:55.777 --> 01:50:55.907
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22781-0
01:51:00.167 --> 01:51:01.047
Uh X + y.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22804-0
01:51:05.827 --> 01:51:10.409
One, no, this is nothing but
Sigma I equal to 1 trillion mod

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22804-1
01:51:10.409 --> 01:51:12.137
of XI plus Y8, correct.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22806-0
01:51:13.417 --> 01:51:13.777
Got it.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22816-0
01:51:15.267 --> 01:51:17.937
Now you know this property for
mod.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22855-0
01:51:17.947 --> 01:51:22.692
This is nothing but Sigma I
equal to 1 to N this norm of X +

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22855-1
01:51:22.692 --> 01:51:27.671
y mod of X + y will be less than
or equal to mod of XI plus mod

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22855-2
01:51:27.671 --> 01:51:28.527
of I agree.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22862-0
01:51:29.697 --> 01:51:30.327
Like so.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22866-0
01:51:31.107 --> 01:51:31.347
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22893-0
01:51:31.587 --> 01:51:37.504
Is this equal to Sigma I equal
to 1 to N now mod of XI plus

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22893-1
01:51:37.504 --> 01:51:40.857
Sigma I equal to 1 to N mod of
Y?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22904-0
01:51:42.077 --> 01:51:45.127
This is equal to norm of X1 plus
norm of X.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22906-0
01:51:47.337 --> 01:51:47.697
Agreed.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22917-0
01:51:49.597 --> 01:51:49.967
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22926-0
01:51:50.247 --> 01:51:50.857
I just.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22928-0
01:51:50.637 --> 01:51:51.037
Yes, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22927-0
01:51:50.647 --> 01:51:51.047
Yes, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22936-0
01:51:51.087 --> 01:51:54.475
Well, I have proved all the
three properties for this

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22936-1
01:51:54.475 --> 01:51:55.667
definition of what?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22943-0
01:51:56.147 --> 01:51:57.187
So this becomes a knob.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22957-0
01:52:01.917 --> 01:52:02.517
Got it, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22960-0
01:52:02.877 --> 01:52:04.897
But yes, yes, yes Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22959-0
01:52:03.387 --> 01:52:03.827
Got it.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22964-0
01:52:09.177 --> 01:52:09.537
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22965-0

01:52:17.407 --> 01:52:21.027
Now let me ask one question to
the TS.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/22982-0
01:52:23.637 --> 01:52:24.827

Good.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23015-0
01:52:29.217 --> 01:52:33.337
They got you are also here now.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23002-0

01:52:30.227 --> 01:52:30.877
I'm also here.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23025-0
01:52:33.347 --> 01:52:37.167
You want to prove this is now
makes 2.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23034-0
01:52:39.237 --> 01:52:41.267
Sigma mod X i.e.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23054-0
01:52:41.857 --> 01:52:45.947
Square I equal to 1 together
HARIKA you are from pure

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23054-1
01:52:45.947 --> 01:52:49.507
mathematics or applied
mathematics background.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23061-0
01:52:50.847 --> 01:52:51.747
Applied mathematics.

01:52:52.927 --> 01:52:55.057
OK, then I can make it slightly
tough for you.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23076-0
01:52:56.457 --> 01:52:56.907
Ohh.

the P pole power one by P.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23111-0
01:53:05.437 --> 01:53:09.447
Now tell me if you have to prove
this to be these to be norms.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23121-0
01:53:10.987 --> 01:53:14.117
And what is the kind of
inequality you use?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23131-0
01:53:19.017 --> 01:53:20.697
And because he's questioning
quality.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23133-0
01:53:21.617 --> 01:53:21.977
Which one?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23144-0
01:53:23.377 --> 01:53:24.837
KASHTE questioning quality, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23156-0
01:53:25.307 --> 01:53:29.816
No, but even fundamental there
is something called holders

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23156-1
01:53:29.816 --> 01:53:30.657
inequality.

01:53:34.187 --> 01:53:35.877
Or Minkowski is in quality.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23164-0
01:53:34.227 --> 01:53:34.647
Anyway.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23173-0
01:53:37.427 --> 01:53:38.127
And yes, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23175-0
01:53:38.137 --> 01:53:38.247
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23182-0
01:53:39.867 --> 01:53:40.367
How are you doing?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23195-0
01:53:42.317 --> 01:53:46.147
For others, no need to get
signed by these things.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23218-0
01:53:47.057 --> 01:53:49.665
Basically the point is, there
are other inequalities in

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23218-1
01:53:49.665 --> 01:53:52.227
mathematics which can help you
prove all these things.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23225-0
01:53:52.237 --> 01:53:53.247
I'm just quoting them.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23258-0
01:53:53.517 --> 01:53:57.029
You don't have to go through
that, but these are proven facts

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23258-1
01:53:57.029 --> 01:54:00.767
you have to take each one in its
own spirit, and then you have to

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23258-2
01:54:00.767 --> 01:54:01.107
do it.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23264-0
01:54:01.597 --> 01:54:02.907
Now the the first.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23286-0
01:54:02.917 --> 01:54:06.374
The first one is actually the
special case of the second one,

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23286-1
01:54:06.374 --> 01:54:08.047
where P is equal to two agree.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23298-0
01:54:08.497 --> 01:54:10.657
But I can define it for any
general P.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23295-0
01:54:09.457 --> 01:54:09.887
How fast?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23300-0
01:54:12.137 --> 01:54:12.467
Yes, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23308-0
01:54:12.477 --> 01:54:14.117
First one is distance between
two points.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23327-0
01:54:17.057 --> 01:54:20.407
Everything is distance now the
the the point is this.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23333-0
01:54:19.617 --> 01:54:19.857
Yeah, yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23381-0
01:54:20.497 --> 01:54:23.891
These are all distances, but the
only point is what I've written

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23381-1
01:54:23.891 --> 01:54:27.181
for P equal to two here can be
generalized for P equal P here,

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23381-2
01:54:27.181 --> 01:54:29.897
and if you are ever trying to
prove that this is an

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23365-0
01:54:27.437 --> 01:54:27.657
Hi.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23381-3
01:54:29.897 --> 01:54:32.247
inequality, you have minkowski's
inequality.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23397-0
01:54:32.557 --> 01:54:35.614
Whole days inequality actually
mikos is inequality is proved

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23397-1
01:54:35.614 --> 01:54:36.967
from whole days inequality.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23439-0
01:54:37.197 --> 01:54:39.709
So you can use these two
inequalities to do that, but I

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23439-1
01:54:39.709 --> 01:54:42.581
don't want any of the data since
students to get into this, but

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23439-2
01:54:42.581 --> 01:54:45.138
there are proofs available in
the market, just have that

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23439-3
01:54:45.138 --> 01:54:45.497
concept.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23458-0
01:54:46.507 --> 01:54:49.486
Anyway, time is up for the
present class, so in next class

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23458-1
01:54:49.486 --> 01:54:50.597
I will, uh have to do.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23460-0
01:54:50.647 --> 01:54:51.897
Uh. Considerably?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23489-0
01:54:51.907 --> 01:54:56.225
I have to do some 222023 slides
so I might take about an hour or

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23489-1
01:54:56.225 --> 01:54:58.617
so and then start with the
Lecture.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23515-0
01:54:59.117 --> 01:55:02.778
So I hope I will clarify things
slowly, but give me some time

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23515-1
01:55:02.778 --> 01:55:05.317
and then you also ask these
questions, OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23546-0
01:55:06.927 --> 01:55:10.567
That is it possible to give some
some exercise and norms?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23534-0
01:55:07.837 --> 01:55:08.457
Shows up.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23526-0
01:55:08.187 --> 01:55:08.477
Covered.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23539-0
01:55:09.547 --> 01:55:09.957
Yes, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23548-0
01:55:11.407 --> 01:55:12.417
Your voice is too low.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23559-0
01:55:12.427 --> 01:55:13.207
Is it possible to?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23563-0
01:55:14.057 --> 01:55:15.907
Get some exercise on norms.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23572-0
01:55:18.517 --> 01:55:18.837
Access.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23584-0
01:55:19.807 --> 01:55:20.387
Exercise.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23600-0
01:55:20.057 --> 01:55:22.877
Yeah, he's saying he's saying
can you get some exercises when

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23603-0
01:55:21.767 --> 01:55:23.487
I didn't questions simple
questions.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23600-1
01:55:22.877 --> 01:55:23.287
they can?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23606-0
01:55:23.357 --> 01:55:24.037
We can practice.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23611-0
01:55:25.517 --> 01:55:26.367
I have the.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23643-0
01:55:26.377 --> 01:55:29.608
I don't know whether you people
are reading the the actual

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23643-1
01:55:29.608 --> 01:55:32.894
announcements in one of the
announcements I have put, there

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23643-2
01:55:32.894 --> 01:55:35.687
is a book called linear algebra
by Gilbert Strang.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23656-0
01:55:36.417 --> 01:55:38.387
Did you have a look at it?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23653-0
01:55:39.227 --> 01:55:39.767
Yes, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23660-0
01:55:39.847 --> 01:55:40.177
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23670-0
01:55:40.187 --> 01:55:40.927
That time I'll look.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23673-0
01:55:40.937 --> 01:55:41.047
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23683-0
01:55:41.127 --> 01:55:42.947
He does 300 problems there.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23695-0
01:55:41.467 --> 01:55:43.277
Yes, that was a announcement,
Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23737-0
01:55:42.247 --> 01:55:44.237
And I have to solve umm.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23692-0
01:55:43.767 --> 01:55:44.777
Yeah, it is an announcement.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23701-0
01:55:44.787 --> 01:55:46.237
So it has 300 problems there.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23712-0
01:55:46.997 --> 01:55:48.877
I have not been able to do even
five of them.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23731-0
01:55:53.887 --> 01:55:56.756
I I can cut and paste from there
and give it in the canvas

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23731-1
01:55:56.756 --> 01:55:57.097
portal.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23734-0
01:55:57.107 --> 01:55:57.487
Will it help?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23780-0
01:55:59.667 --> 01:56:03.602
Another we can referendum and if
you Google will get a lot of

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23772-0
01:56:00.797 --> 01:56:02.867
Then I'll say I'll look in the
books I know.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23780-1
01:56:03.602 --> 01:56:04.047
places.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23841-0
01:56:04.167 --> 01:56:07.075
Yeah, you, you, you Google that
book, you will get it and then

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23841-1
01:56:07.075 --> 01:56:09.892
you can do start doing this and
you can bring some questions

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23841-2
01:56:09.892 --> 01:56:12.385
here in the class and then we
can do that if you come

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23841-3
01:56:12.385 --> 01:56:15.155
prepared, we can discuss more
items and then I can tell you

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23841-4
01:56:15.155 --> 01:56:18.017
some tips and tricks which are
being used in maths and we can

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23841-5
01:56:18.017 --> 01:56:18.387
do that.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23846-0
01:56:18.397 --> 01:56:20.327
But that's somehow not gaining
momentum.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23879-0
01:56:20.937 --> 01:56:24.557
Let me also find out a way by
which they can be done OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23869-0
01:56:24.257 --> 01:56:24.747
Thank you, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23936-0
01:56:24.757 --> 01:56:29.164
Is it possible for to share
questions content, paste the one

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23889-0
01:56:28.017 --> 01:56:28.747
What quest?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23895-0
01:56:29.007 --> 01:56:29.527
What is?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23936-1
01:56:29.164 --> 01:56:33.643
cause no, no, just now you told
right cut and paste questions

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23913-0
01:56:29.537 --> 01:56:30.937
What is the question you are
looking for?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23936-2
01:56:33.643 --> 01:56:35.377
and share in the canvas.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23928-0
01:56:34.947 --> 01:56:35.597
I'm going.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23956-0
01:56:35.607 --> 01:56:37.888
I'm telling you, if I have to
cut and paste and to cut and

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23956-1
01:56:37.888 --> 01:56:39.087
paste from Gilbert Strang only.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23950-0
01:56:39.367 --> 01:56:39.707
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23952-0
01:56:39.717 --> 01:56:39.977
Yes.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23960-0
01:56:39.987 --> 01:56:40.987
Please, that's what I am.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23972-0
01:56:40.997 --> 01:56:41.927
I'm I'm referring to.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23968-0
01:56:41.417 --> 01:56:41.897
How are you?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23975-0
01:56:42.267 --> 01:56:42.897
Yeah, I have a.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23978-0
01:56:42.907 --> 01:56:44.157
What now?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/23985-0
01:56:44.167 --> 01:56:45.497
You know, I am your TA.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24005-0
01:56:45.907 --> 01:56:49.045
You expect me to if you type
Gilbert Strang linear algebra,

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24005-1
01:56:49.045 --> 01:56:50.457
you'll be able to get this.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24017-0
01:56:50.467 --> 01:56:53.257
I also wrote saying that he has
given several YouTube videos.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24050-0
01:56:53.707 --> 01:56:59.026
Now in his book, which is really
downloadable, he has given some

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24050-1
01:56:59.026 --> 01:57:01.317
500 problems or so you want.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24046-0
01:57:00.447 --> 01:57:01.077
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24072-0
01:57:01.127 --> 01:57:02.407
When you said I will search it
up.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24068-0
01:57:01.327 --> 01:57:03.717
I can take a screenshot of it
and post it to you.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24092-0
01:57:03.727 --> 01:57:06.502
Send a WhatsApp to you, but that
is not going to solve any

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24092-1
01:57:06.502 --> 01:57:07.537
problem in my opinion.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24120-0
01:57:07.627 --> 01:57:10.841
If you want looking for problems
on positive definiteness or

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24120-1
01:57:10.841 --> 01:57:14.055
norms, etcetera, you download
the book and then you have 300

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24120-2
01:57:14.055 --> 01:57:15.267
problems straight away.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24128-0
01:57:16.737 --> 01:57:18.367
There are some 1012 problems
here.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24132-0
01:57:16.897 --> 01:57:17.207
God.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24183-0
01:57:18.377 --> 01:57:21.828
Solved and there are some 1520
problems in each exercise, which

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24183-1
01:57:21.828 --> 01:57:25.063
is left as you know, access
problems if you are not able to

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24183-2
01:57:25.063 --> 01:57:28.190
solve any excess problem you
write to me or to my TS they

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24183-3
01:57:28.190 --> 01:57:30.617
will be helping you to solve
these problems.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24202-0
01:57:30.627 --> 01:57:35.867
Agree but me trying to they are
not my problems.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24187-0
01:57:31.797 --> 01:57:32.857
Got it, got it.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24196-0
01:57:32.867 --> 01:57:33.307
Well, kisses.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24224-0
01:57:35.877 --> 01:57:38.998
In a sense, you know, I should
be very honest in saying those

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24224-1
01:57:38.998 --> 01:57:41.667
problems are very neatly
articulated better than me.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24266-0
01:57:41.797 --> 01:57:45.406
So I think it is better that you
start doing it from a book and

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24266-1
01:57:45.406 --> 01:57:48.790
you can also look at the section
number and you can also go

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24266-2
01:57:48.790 --> 01:57:51.779
through go back and forth
etcetera and then do those

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24266-3
01:57:51.779 --> 01:57:52.287
problems.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24272-0
01:57:52.297 --> 01:57:53.787
Any doubts you please ask me.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24292-0
01:57:58.097 --> 01:57:58.397
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24301-0
01:57:58.907 --> 01:58:01.017
Because I'll tell the LECTURES
slides so.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24299-0
01:57:58.977 --> 01:57:59.517
Got it.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24305-0
01:58:00.037 --> 01:58:01.597
I said just one question.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24300-0
01:58:00.447 --> 01:58:00.967
OK, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24316-0
01:58:03.077 --> 01:58:05.487
So can we move to your octave
notebook?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24314-0
01:58:03.337 --> 01:58:03.477
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24340-0
01:58:05.497 --> 01:58:09.402
I just want to know the trick
you used to find those bases

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24340-1
01:58:09.402 --> 01:58:10.527
vector R2 and R3.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24347-0
01:58:11.787 --> 01:58:13.567
Where you were making those
notes?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24361-0
01:58:14.037 --> 01:58:17.117
The one basis vector was 10 and
01.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24370-0
01:58:17.127 --> 01:58:19.747
The others you told were one,
three, and four.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24374-0
01:58:19.757 --> 01:58:20.127
Seven.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24380-0
01:58:20.137 --> 01:58:22.237
I believe so.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24379-0
01:58:21.117 --> 01:58:21.297
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24388-0
01:58:22.247 --> 01:58:23.737
What was the trick you used?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24402-0
01:58:23.747 --> 01:58:27.047
Without calculations you were
able to identify those 3

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24402-1
01:58:27.047 --> 01:58:27.527
vectors.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24406-0
01:58:27.357 --> 01:58:29.647
Ah, the the point is this.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24439-0
01:58:29.657 --> 01:58:34.004
Now if you have two vectors, you
especially if you form them as

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24439-1
01:58:34.004 --> 01:58:38.079
column vectors and you see the
determinant is nonzero, they

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24439-2
01:58:38.079 --> 01:58:39.777
will always be a a basis.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24456-0
01:58:41.707 --> 01:58:44.677
Like the trick is, uh, the
determinant should be non 0.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24459-0
01:58:45.097 --> 01:58:45.817
Yeah, exactly.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24460-0
01:58:46.337 --> 01:58:46.717
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24463-0
01:58:48.377 --> 01:58:48.667
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24479-0
01:58:48.677 --> 01:58:50.017
Yeah, somebody was telling me
something.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24485-0
01:58:50.627 --> 01:58:52.727
Other than the lecture slides,
is it available?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24492-0
01:58:52.737 --> 01:58:53.737
Uh meeting bug or?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24505-0
01:58:55.407 --> 01:58:57.557
Your voice is still not very
clearly audible.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24516-0
01:58:57.567 --> 01:58:58.747
Can somebody translate it?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24531-0
01:58:57.957 --> 01:59:02.595
Except for the lecture slides,
what you used you said table in

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24527-0
01:59:00.417 --> 01:59:00.747
See.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24531-1
01:59:02.595 --> 01:59:03.037
teams.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24540-0
01:59:04.587 --> 01:59:05.217
Yes, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24550-0
01:59:04.937 --> 01:59:05.747
Really, you just see this?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24554-0
01:59:05.347 --> 01:59:06.577
Lecture say it's supposed to.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24557-0
01:59:06.097 --> 01:59:07.017
It alright.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24566-0
01:59:07.617 --> 01:59:10.207
No Lecture slides are posted on
canvas portal.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24573-0
01:59:10.217 --> 01:59:11.267
Should I show that to you?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24571-0
01:59:10.567 --> 01:59:10.877
And what?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24585-0
01:59:13.437 --> 01:59:14.327
OK, I'll find out.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24596-0
01:59:14.337 --> 01:59:15.807
Checking I will searching
things.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24606-0
01:59:15.817 --> 01:59:16.457
Yeah. Thanks.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24604-0
01:59:15.977 --> 01:59:17.627
They're under module sections.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24616-0
01:59:17.637 --> 01:59:18.767
They are posted, Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24619-0
01:59:19.157 --> 01:59:20.747
No, he's asking in teams.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24626-0
01:59:20.757 --> 01:59:21.747
In teams it is not.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24659-0
01:59:21.757 --> 01:59:26.037
In teams, we just post whatever
notes I'm I'm doing now.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24668-0
01:59:24.837 --> 01:59:28.330
That if if necessary, I can post
that also there are no problem I

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24660-0
01:59:25.477 --> 01:59:26.137
Missing animal.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24668-1
01:59:28.330 --> 01:59:29.177
can do that Sir.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24676-0
01:59:31.137 --> 01:59:31.467
Thank you.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24681-0
01:59:32.337 --> 01:59:32.657
OK.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24707-0
01:59:32.387 --> 01:59:36.433
Uh, so there, so the
announcement there is a mention

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24707-1
01:59:36.433 --> 01:59:41.166
about webinar schedule where it
is 12th December, the 7:30 to

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24697-0
01:59:37.527 --> 01:59:37.707
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24709-0
01:59:40.737 --> 01:59:40.897
Yeah.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24707-2
01:59:41.166 --> 01:59:41.777
9:00 PM.

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24712-0
01:59:42.697 --> 01:59:43.557
How so?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24723-0
01:59:43.617 --> 01:59:46.667
The OK can you just give a
brief?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24734-0
01:59:46.677 --> 01:59:48.817
Like, how's it different from
the normal Lecture?

f9b0d552-f2df-4183-8a7c-6054d2e210cb/24736-0
01:59:49.517 --> 01:59:50.357
Yeah, sure.
