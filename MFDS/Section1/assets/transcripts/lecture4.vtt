00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.326
Getting the complete code you or
anywhere writing that to get the

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/123-1
00:00:06.326 --> 00:00:06.899
answer right.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/125-0
00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.189
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/124-0
00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:08.339
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/133-0
00:00:11.229 --> 00:00:12.349
I don't know.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/144-0
00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:12.739
I don't know I.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/140-0
00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:13.179
I keep getting.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/170-0
00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:17.271
I keep getting these questions
again and again, but I don't

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/151-0
00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.949
You.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/170-1
00:00:17.271 --> 00:00:20.689
know if you look through the
assignment sheet properly.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/166-0
00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:18.739
I can't.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/200-0
00:00:21.459 --> 00:00:21.789
This is.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/178-0
00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:22.929
Should I show you the assignment
sheet?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/182-0
00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:25.289
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/213-0
00:00:25.299 --> 00:00:28.440
Please as and can you please
explain like what is exactly

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/201-0
00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:27.859
Yes, Sir. Please.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/213-1
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:28.819
needed?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/222-0
00:00:29.209 --> 00:00:30.439
Sir, actually the.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/218-0
00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.359
And that is what is written
Baba.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/239-0
00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.212
It is written in the document
called Deliverables right in the

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/231-0
00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:34.129
And.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/239-1
00:00:35.212 --> 00:00:36.799
document under this right.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/251-0
00:00:37.999 --> 00:00:41.329
So you will write a code in your
computer.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/259-0
00:00:41.419 --> 00:00:41.889
Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/257-0
00:00:41.849 --> 00:00:42.159
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/272-0
00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:43.729
If I take the are you able to
see my screen?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/274-0
00:00:42.349 --> 00:00:42.969
Is not visible.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/280-0
00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:45.259
No, no.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/279-0
00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:44.989
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/292-0
00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:47.409
Yeah, we can see now.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/300-0
00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:49.119
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/301-0
00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:48.749
Yes, I can.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/308-0
00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:50.689
That's what I did there.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/337-0
00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:55.596
So what is not clear, if I take
one year you will write a code

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/337-1
00:00:55.596 --> 00:00:58.709
in your computer and you will do
this.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/335-0
00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.459
It's like.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/361-0
00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:02.519
You will output this REF and
RREF for any gentle matrix

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/361-1
00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:05.549
without using any of the built
in functions.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/387-0
00:01:06.769 --> 00:01:10.159
Now whenever you get some
problem division by zero Anand

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/387-1
00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.669
not a number, etcetera, you can
choose a different A or B.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/403-0
00:01:14.379 --> 00:01:17.504
You will just write the quote
report showing the procedure for

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/403-1
00:01:17.504 --> 00:01:18.149
REF and RREF.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/410-0
00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:19.349
You do not write hash.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/420-0
00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:21.209
Include something import.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/418-0
00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:21.069
Bad dawg.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/422-0
00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:23.499
Don't know. Ohh.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/433-0
00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:26.069
There are some dialogue.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/454-0
00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:28.179
Send it up talking Super garden
that you S7.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/461-0
00:01:27.739 --> 00:01:29.129
Shoe shoe.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/466-0
00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:30.459
Can you go on mute please?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/470-0
00:01:29.739 --> 00:01:31.069
This is the problem with you
guys.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/489-0
00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:34.512
I I think while doing this
course you are engaged in other

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/486-0
00:01:31.809 --> 00:01:32.859
You go on mute please.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/488-0
00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:33.289
Doing.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/489-1
00:01:34.512 --> 00:01:35.059
activities.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/508-0
00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.629
I thought that this is amply
clear.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/507-0
00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:41.829
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/521-0
00:01:43.089 --> 00:01:45.729
If you read through that you
don't need to write the entire.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/541-0
00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:49.066
I have also written in the in
the beginning saying that if

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/541-1
00:01:49.066 --> 00:01:52.169
somebody has to transpose a
matrix, what will I write?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/568-0
00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:55.785
I will not keep including AI
will not allocate the calloc,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/568-1
00:01:55.785 --> 00:01:58.829
malloc functions, allocate
memory for a memory for B.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/577-0
00:01:58.839 --> 00:02:01.709
That is all you would write in
your code.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/586-0
00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:03.849
Now, why will you write the
entire code?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/603-0
00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:06.369
I am not going to compile the
code if you write it in hand.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/615-0
00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:10.729
Just write what part you'll use
for getting the REF and RREF.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/646-0
00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.590
I just want to see your logic
there in the second question you

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/636-0
00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:14.029
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/646-1
00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.219
want to find the pivot and non
pivot yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/658-0
00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.589
So so sorry.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/669-0
00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.899
Any language we can write so
right that's can be.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/686-0
00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:22.638
So you don't, so you are not
interested in like how we are

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/686-1
00:02:22.638 --> 00:02:26.189
taking a matrix whether we are
generating it randomly or not.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/701-0
00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:28.239
You just need the arieff and
RREF logic, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/709-0
00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.139
But if you come to wait, wait,
wait.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/715-0
00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:30.089
That's all.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/733-0
00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:35.025
If you come to this, see
partner, you have to consider

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/728-0
00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:34.369
Mm-hmm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/733-1
00:02:35.025 --> 00:02:36.999
the five cross seven matrix.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/770-0
00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:41.597
So if you read through one
carefully, I will take a random

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/741-0
00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.829
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/770-1
00:02:41.597 --> 00:02:46.419
matrix A and start performing
that and whenever I want to see

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/763-0
00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.329
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/770-2
00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:48.519
should I show it in octave.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/772-0
00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:50.789
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/789-0
00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:53.259
Update.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/798-0
00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:55.409
So VENKATA said, we have to do
in Octave.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/802-0
00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:57.359
No, actually this one day and
one year are confusing.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/817-0
00:02:57.369 --> 00:03:00.079
So one and one she these are a
bit confusing.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/836-0
00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:04.245
Once we had written write a code
and the other we had asked to

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/836-1
00:03:04.245 --> 00:03:05.499
take random matrix.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/842-0
00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:07.989
What is confusing in that Bubba?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/854-0
00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:12.109
No, in in the first one, yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/859-0
00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:12.979
Uh, do you need?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/888-0
00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.869
I mean, you only need the logic
for REF and RREF, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/875-0
00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:16.069
Honey, that is.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/877-0
00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.499
No, no.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/885-0
00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:17.179
What is the?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/892-0
00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.649
I don't I don't understand. I
think.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/898-0
00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:21.719
Wait, let me explain to you.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/906-0
00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:27.909
So A equal to input.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/911-0
00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.609
Uh.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/914-0
00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:34.999
Input there matrix.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/918-0
00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:39.709
Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/931-0
00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:41.969
So you can say so I will just.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/933-0
00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:41.019
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/937-0
00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:45.519
I will just say 123.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/964-0
00:03:47.499 --> 00:03:56.908
Semicolon 456, semicolon 789
agree enter and now what is

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/955-0
00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.209
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/964-1
00:03:56.908 --> 00:03:59.219
there in here?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/969-0
00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:00.549
This matrix is there, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/975-0
00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.649
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/980-0
00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:03.709
Now, are you like again?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/987-0
00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:05.529
I will do input a matrix.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1003-0
00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:10.999
I will just say Randolph 3,
comma three you put in.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1006-0
00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.639
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1014-0
00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:13.539
A some random entries are there,
right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1019-0
00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.489
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1026-0
00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:16.959
What is a big problem in the?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1029-0
00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:18.009
This is only one lane.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1059-0
00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.619
No, we are just asking you don't
know this this.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1076-0
00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:24.889
So so the question is like where
do we need to so we.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1083-0
00:04:24.519 --> 00:04:27.426
Yeah, you write the code, you
write the code in the generic

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1079-0
00:04:24.549 --> 00:04:25.629
Yeah, you don't need this.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1083-1
00:04:27.426 --> 00:04:27.669
form.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1100-0
00:04:27.679 --> 00:04:31.644
You can always input random
matrices or you can input any

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1100-1
00:04:31.644 --> 00:04:33.149
matrix of your choice.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1114-0
00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:33.119
Will you?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1122-0
00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:35.409
Also, it is just one line in the
in the coding, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1117-0
00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:35.659
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1156-0
00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:39.580
Yeah, so this is what we need,
Sir, because it's written like a

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1144-0
00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:39.819
That the.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1156-1
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.159
write a code once and in the 3rd
it's returned to take the random

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1156-2
00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.539
matrix.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1173-0
00:04:43.549 --> 00:04:44.789
So it was a bit concerned.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1177-0
00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:45.009
I never bought right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1183-0
00:04:44.799 --> 00:04:45.199
Now it's clear.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1190-0
00:04:45.739 --> 00:04:47.789
No, no, you have not read
through that.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1201-0
00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:50.369
I I have spent hours together
writing company.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1242-0
00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:53.432
In this document there if I
asked you to write the code for

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1219-0
00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:52.889
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1242-1
00:04:53.432 --> 00:04:56.638
inputting and metrics, how will
you write a code for inputting

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1242-2
00:04:56.638 --> 00:04:58.419
in M cross in metrics you tell
me?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1253-0
00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:01.099
Will you write all the elements
of the M cross in metrics?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1272-0
00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:05.985
No, we were thinking to use some
random generation using Numpy

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1272-1
00:05:05.985 --> 00:05:06.389
and all.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1274-0
00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:07.799
Whatever said.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1318-0
00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:11.847
And then you will say at the
same time, if I am completely

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1318-1
00:05:11.847 --> 00:05:16.158
jobless, I can also enter if I
for example if my M is 10 and N

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1318-2
00:05:16.158 --> 00:05:19.649
is 15, I can write 10 cross 15
by hand also right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1324-0
00:05:20.239 --> 00:05:20.589
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1333-0
00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:23.829
So it can also be passed from a
file.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1351-0
00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:26.942
I already have a data file from
where M cross and can be passed

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1351-1
00:05:26.942 --> 00:05:27.469
on to this.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1357-0
00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:29.649
So why does that interfere?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1370-0
00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:32.609
You write a program what you
want to give as input.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1378-0
00:05:32.619 --> 00:05:33.859
You can give from some file
also.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1381-0
00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:35.359
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1389-0
00:05:36.109 --> 00:05:39.009
So Venkat said we need to use
the octave.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1398-0
00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:42.459
For this question.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1407-0
00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:44.459
No, no you can't.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1410-0
00:05:44.799 --> 00:05:46.049
That is what I am saying.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1413-0
00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:45.549
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1418-0
00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:47.789
I have said I have prepared
this.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1431-0
00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:51.919
You have not read the first line
of the instructions.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1438-0
00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:53.349
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1450-0
00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:55.149
But then after.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1455-0
00:05:54.519 --> 00:05:57.969
Use any programming language
other than excel of your choice.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1471-0
00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:01.208
Attach only the relevant data in
your submission and no need to

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1471-1
00:06:01.208 --> 00:06:02.369
submit the entire code.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1481-0
00:06:03.299 --> 00:06:05.159
You would just have to tell me
the snippet.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1493-0
00:06:08.679 --> 00:06:10.289
So do we need to write it
manually?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1503-0
00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:09.059
Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1518-0
00:06:10.299 --> 00:06:13.279
I mean on pen, pen, paper or
just take a snapshot on, OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1514-0
00:06:10.989 --> 00:06:13.739
Yeah, 100 percent 100%.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1539-0
00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:18.944
You have to write it manually
and then only Friday there are

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1525-0
00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:16.939
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1539-1
00:06:18.944 --> 00:06:21.099
only if there are outputs.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1549-0
00:06:21.109 --> 00:06:24.649
Suppose I ask you to say you
plot some figure.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1562-0
00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:26.639
That's what we will do in PCA
etcetera.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1585-0
00:06:26.649 --> 00:06:30.132
That figure can be cut and
pasted in your document, but

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1585-1
00:06:30.132 --> 00:06:33.679
these are very simple things, so
you have to just write.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1604-0
00:06:33.809 --> 00:06:38.402
See suppose I suppose I say that
I need the output for something,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1604-1
00:06:38.402 --> 00:06:39.029
so I say.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1614-0
00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:43.629
Hey, equal to Randolph.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1629-0
00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:47.489
Uh, I'm just giving you 2 comma
five.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1633-0
00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:48.709
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1635-0
00:06:48.859 --> 00:06:50.119
You gotta do cost, right?
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1637-0
00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:50.899
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1660-0
00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:55.483
Now you do elementary row
operations, whatever it is, and

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1660-1
00:06:55.483 --> 00:06:57.749
you have to identify the pivot
columns.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1671-0
00:06:58.079 --> 00:07:01.241
Let's say the 1st and 2nd
columns are pivot columns.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1671-1
00:07:01.241 --> 00:07:01.599
Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1680-0
00:07:05.529 --> 00:07:05.969
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1678-0
00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:06.139
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1686-0
00:07:06.869 --> 00:07:07.089
Yep.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1685-0
00:07:06.929 --> 00:07:07.109
If.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1689-0
00:07:07.749 --> 00:07:08.999
Then what will it say?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1710-0
00:07:09.049 --> 00:07:12.496
First column and 2nd column are
pivot columns 3rd, 4th and 5th

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1710-1
00:07:12.496 --> 00:07:14.029
are non pivot columns right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1714-0
00:07:14.749 --> 00:07:15.029
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1715-0
00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:15.109
Mm-hmm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1722-0
00:07:16.579 --> 00:07:18.249
The the program should output
only that.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1723-0
00:07:19.239 --> 00:07:19.419
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1753-0
00:07:22.019 --> 00:07:25.469
So and then if you want the
solution, you can write the.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1746-0
00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:25.809
Accord are you?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1750-0
00:07:25.819 --> 00:07:27.009
Do you need any specific?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1762-0
00:07:27.019 --> 00:07:28.949
Like whatever programming
language we choose.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1771-0
00:07:29.139 --> 00:07:30.449
Are you fine with just
pseudocode at?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1785-0
00:07:30.619 --> 00:07:32.789
Because no, we're not going to
give you a full program, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1799-0
00:07:34.819 --> 00:07:37.819
Yes bro code with some syntax is
only a snippet.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1802-0
00:07:39.839 --> 00:07:40.209
So.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1812-0
00:07:40.419 --> 00:07:43.299
So which programming language is
it Python in?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1832-0
00:07:43.359 --> 00:07:46.239
I am not able to understand
sorry what?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1829-0
00:07:43.749 --> 00:07:45.439
No, no, no, no, no.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1837-0
00:07:45.489 --> 00:07:47.859
Actually, Sir needs the logic.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1842-0
00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:47.249
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1855-0
00:07:47.389 --> 00:07:49.039
Hmm, OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1859-0
00:07:47.919 --> 00:07:50.994
The only the logic for I mean
how we do the elementary

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1857-0
00:07:49.609 --> 00:07:49.809
So.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1859-1
00:07:50.994 --> 00:07:51.609
operations.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1870-0
00:07:51.619 --> 00:07:52.629
He needs that logic. That's.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1868-0
00:07:51.969 --> 00:07:53.699
Yeah, exactly.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1904-0
00:07:54.069 --> 00:07:57.531
So what I'm saying is somebody
must have done during the

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1904-1
00:07:57.531 --> 00:08:01.358
college teams 20 years back seat
somebody might have went four

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1899-0
00:08:00.679 --> 00:08:01.139
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1904-2
00:08:01.358 --> 00:08:02.209
trans like me.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1918-0
00:08:02.319 --> 00:08:06.620
Somebody would have done C++ or
yeah, yeah, the the younger

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1918-1
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:09.129
batch made through have done
Java.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1937-0
00:08:09.419 --> 00:08:12.989
Somebody even later than that,
they would have done by 10.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1933-0
00:08:11.029 --> 00:08:11.319
And.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1950-0
00:08:13.039 --> 00:08:16.809
I am least bothered about what
program language you use here.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1961-0
00:08:16.639 --> 00:08:16.999
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1968-0
00:08:16.799 --> 00:08:18.069
Yeah, sure.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1970-0
00:08:16.819 --> 00:08:19.689
I'm just going to use a couple
of form groups here and there.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1979-0
00:08:19.779 --> 00:08:20.159
That's it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1974-0
00:08:20.369 --> 00:08:20.529
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1981-0
00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:21.339
All right.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1983-0
00:08:21.329 --> 00:08:21.879
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1990-0
00:08:21.349 --> 00:08:21.999
Thank you.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1985-0
00:08:21.889 --> 00:08:22.259
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1992-0
00:08:22.269 --> 00:08:22.599
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/1994-0
00:08:22.609 --> 00:08:23.269
OK, got it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2033-0
00:08:22.909 --> 00:08:25.019
A true then.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2013-0
00:08:23.279 --> 00:08:25.229
OK, that code snippet unit.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2016-0
00:08:23.999 --> 00:08:26.849
And for a for loop and for a for
loop.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2027-0
00:08:27.039 --> 00:08:30.359
I don't know why people make a
big human cry, correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2025-0
00:08:27.359 --> 00:08:27.659
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2040-0
00:08:33.619 --> 00:08:33.909
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2044-0
00:08:33.839 --> 00:08:34.969
Uh, excuse me, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2052-0
00:08:35.139 --> 00:08:35.319
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2055-0
00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:36.099
You don't have it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2057-0
00:08:35.479 --> 00:08:37.209
I did ask the question in the
chat.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2071-0
00:08:37.399 --> 00:08:41.073
If you go to 1C, there is a
question on verification of

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2071-1
00:08:41.073 --> 00:08:42.189
general solution.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2113-0
00:08:42.479 --> 00:08:46.689
I don't need the answer, but do
you mean that a inverse of B or

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2078-0
00:08:42.579 --> 00:08:42.789
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2113-1
00:08:46.689 --> 00:08:50.899
when we get the X complementary
and the particular solution, do

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2113-2
00:08:50.899 --> 00:08:55.109
you want to substitute the value
and give out the verification?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2117-0
00:08:55.119 --> 00:08:56.269
Or is there any other method?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2129-0
00:08:59.119 --> 00:09:01.249
Uh, you used to several.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2133-0
00:08:59.199 --> 00:09:00.839
The verification that the last
part.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2136-0
00:09:01.339 --> 00:09:03.489
Wait, you use several things?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2150-0
00:09:03.899 --> 00:09:06.929
There is no a universe for a 5 +
7 metrics.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2159-0
00:09:07.019 --> 00:09:08.209
That's the first clarification.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2161-0
00:09:08.039 --> 00:09:08.999
Yeah, yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2199-0
00:09:09.709 --> 00:09:13.489
Now the second is, if I give A5
cross seven random matrix to

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2199-1
00:09:13.489 --> 00:09:17.454
you, what you should show is the
program should be able to show

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2199-2
00:09:17.454 --> 00:09:20.739
the RREF, RREF, the pivot
columns non pivot columns.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2244-0
00:09:20.949 --> 00:09:24.493
The particular solution and the
solution to a X equal to 0 and

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2229-0
00:09:24.289 --> 00:09:25.899
Yeah, that's done. Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2244-1
00:09:24.493 --> 00:09:28.094
the general solution and verify
the so your code should be able

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2244-2
00:09:28.094 --> 00:09:29.389
to do all these things.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2264-0
00:09:30.929 --> 00:09:34.679
And that's the only part which I
don't get to verify the general

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2258-0
00:09:33.149 --> 00:09:33.579
Wait.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2264-1
00:09:34.679 --> 00:09:35.199
solution.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2272-0
00:09:35.839 --> 00:09:37.869
Yeah. Ohh.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2273-0
00:09:36.619 --> 00:09:39.289
So yeah, I I will check.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2279-0
00:09:39.349 --> 00:09:40.109
Thank you very much.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2283-0
00:09:40.119 --> 00:09:40.249
Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2319-0
00:09:40.259 --> 00:09:44.029
Then I am not knowledgeable on
verification of that part, but

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2319-1
00:09:44.029 --> 00:09:47.739
I'm my code is generating the
general solutions but not umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2312-0
00:09:44.159 --> 00:09:47.059
Verification is no suppose no.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2333-0
00:09:47.069 --> 00:09:51.241
Suppose I suppose I say X equal
to two is a solution of three X

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2333-1
00:09:51.241 --> 00:09:52.089
equal to six.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2342-0
00:09:52.099 --> 00:09:52.869
How will you verify that?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2346-0
00:09:54.059 --> 00:09:54.749
Chef statute.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2349-0
00:09:55.689 --> 00:09:56.239
That's it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2372-0
00:09:56.729 --> 00:10:00.579
So you have got you have got
there exactly.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2365-0
00:09:56.839 --> 00:09:56.999
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2368-0
00:09:57.789 --> 00:09:58.939
Hit us up, student back.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2396-0
00:10:00.589 --> 00:10:05.428
So you have got the general
solution to a X equal to 0, so

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2396-1
00:10:05.428 --> 00:10:07.479
you take one out of that.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2414-0
00:10:07.839 --> 00:10:11.662
If there are multiple solutions,
you keep taking one from each

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2414-1
00:10:11.662 --> 00:10:12.269
set there.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2429-0
00:10:12.679 --> 00:10:16.229
Then you take the particular
solution you add up all of them.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2440-0
00:10:16.379 --> 00:10:18.029
All they play it with a on the
left.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2445-0
00:10:18.029 --> 00:10:20.459
OK, OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2444-0
00:10:18.039 --> 00:10:18.799
You should get a 0.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2449-0
00:10:20.549 --> 00:10:21.619
Yeah, got it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2463-0
00:10:21.909 --> 00:10:25.029
So yeah, it's simple, but I was
confused.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2456-0
00:10:22.159 --> 00:10:22.479
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2488-0
00:10:24.849 --> 00:10:27.622
So for once you also you need
the code only or it's

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2481-0
00:10:25.039 --> 00:10:25.739
Thank you very much Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2488-1
00:10:27.622 --> 00:10:29.169
handwritten process you need.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2491-0
00:10:30.649 --> 00:10:31.589
You read deliverable.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2498-0
00:10:31.599 --> 00:10:32.529
See you tell me the answer.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2519-0
00:10:34.349 --> 00:10:37.060
I mean it's it's a matrix and
the quantities code is not

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2519-1
00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:37.679
there, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2516-0
00:10:38.099 --> 00:10:38.909
Exactly.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2531-0
00:10:39.119 --> 00:10:40.709
And you have answered the
question yourself.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2548-0
00:10:40.949 --> 00:10:43.710
I don't think you've spent even
5 minutes reading through the

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2548-1
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:44.289
entire stuff.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2563-0
00:10:44.459 --> 00:10:47.179
If you read through the entire
stuff it is it is precise.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2553-0
00:10:44.669 --> 00:10:45.099
No, no.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2561-0
00:10:45.109 --> 00:10:45.599
So we had.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2574-0
00:10:48.299 --> 00:10:51.439
I don't want the code I want.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2571-0
00:10:48.659 --> 00:10:48.899
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2597-0
00:10:51.449 --> 00:10:55.653
What kind of random matrix is
you are considering the vector B

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2597-1
00:10:55.653 --> 00:10:57.189
on the right hand side?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2602-0
00:10:57.199 --> 00:10:58.209
What have you considered?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2635-0
00:10:58.829 --> 00:11:04.043
And then you will show the RDF,
the RREF, the the pivot columns,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2635-1
00:11:04.043 --> 00:11:07.893
the non pivot columns,
particular solutions and

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2635-2
00:11:07.893 --> 00:11:10.059
solution to a X equal to 0.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2664-0
00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:12.969
These are the things you have to
write that whatever your output

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2664-1
00:11:12.969 --> 00:11:15.692
you're going to get from your
program, you're going to write

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2664-2
00:11:15.692 --> 00:11:16.049
it down.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2674-0
00:11:17.919 --> 00:11:19.849
Sir, one probably just one
question.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2697-0
00:11:19.859 --> 00:11:22.964
For example, in the first
question, do we want to write a

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2697-1
00:11:22.964 --> 00:11:26.069
general code that can take any
random metrics and output?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2730-0
00:11:26.079 --> 00:11:29.040
So it's just like a item
Gaussian elimination code or we

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2730-1
00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.209
take our metrics, take AB and
start the steps of that in the

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2730-2
00:11:32.209 --> 00:11:32.469
code.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2761-0
00:11:32.479 --> 00:11:35.596
For example, if you take a
particular matrix, we can say

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2761-1
00:11:35.596 --> 00:11:38.659
three of row 2 -, 4 of row
three, and then do the steps

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2761-2
00:11:38.659 --> 00:11:39.699
itself in the code?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2785-0
00:11:39.749 --> 00:11:42.278
Or it should be a very general
code that can take up any

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2806-0
00:11:41.639 --> 00:11:45.511
If you, if you, if you, if you
take this code, whatever you are

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2785-1
00:11:42.278 --> 00:11:42.589
metric.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2806-1
00:11:45.511 --> 00:11:49.505
saying now, how will you work it
out for A5 class 7 matrix random

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2806-2
00:11:49.505 --> 00:11:49.929
matrix?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2820-0
00:11:51.669 --> 00:11:53.129
So it should be very general
code, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2846-0
00:11:53.289 --> 00:11:57.729
100% hundred, yeah, absolutely,
absolutely.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2832-0
00:11:53.329 --> 00:11:54.639
100 cross 100 metrics.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2840-0
00:11:54.649 --> 00:11:56.139
Also, anything can be sure.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2849-0
00:11:57.149 --> 00:11:58.259
Yeah, got it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2857-0
00:11:59.179 --> 00:12:01.349
If I if I may go off.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2866-0
00:12:01.359 --> 00:12:03.269
So what I thought is A&amp;B.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2902-0
00:12:03.279 --> 00:12:06.818
I'm writing the functions and
the C part where you can take a

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2902-1
00:12:06.818 --> 00:12:10.187
random metrics and when you
execute that you are using the

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2902-2
00:12:10.187 --> 00:12:12.699
functions of A&amp;B to compile
the output.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2903-0
00:12:11.309 --> 00:12:13.409
Yeah, exactly.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2919-0
00:12:15.709 --> 00:12:17.459
Yeah, I understand now.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2917-0
00:12:16.989 --> 00:12:18.319
Don't write the entire code.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2921-0
00:12:18.329 --> 00:12:19.489
Nobody's going to compile.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2941-0
00:12:19.499 --> 00:12:23.088
Don't bother about declaring a
variable if you're writing in C

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2941-1
00:12:23.088 --> 00:12:24.399
or C++, Java, etcetera.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2950-0
00:12:24.409 --> 00:12:26.099
Don't have to declare a
variable.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2972-0
00:12:26.569 --> 00:12:30.487
Call it as capital and you can
use capital E call as small B

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2972-1
00:12:30.487 --> 00:12:32.029
and you can use small B.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2985-0
00:12:32.949 --> 00:12:36.775
Don't bother about memory
allocation, segmentation fault,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/2985-1
00:12:36.775 --> 00:12:38.029
segmentation fault.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3003-0
00:12:38.039 --> 00:12:42.413
Anyway, bother about it, but
don't look at memory allocation

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3003-1
00:12:42.413 --> 00:12:44.349
and and doing other things.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3011-0
00:12:44.359 --> 00:12:46.329
You just have to write that kind
of a logic.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3014-0
00:12:50.179 --> 00:12:50.479
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3017-0
00:12:55.609 --> 00:12:55.949
Agreed.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3029-0
00:12:58.619 --> 00:12:59.089
Gives her.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3031-0
00:12:59.609 --> 00:13:00.379
Yes it works.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3027-0
00:13:00.089 --> 00:13:00.459
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3032-0
00:13:00.469 --> 00:13:01.199
Any other doubts?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3043-0
00:13:06.199 --> 00:13:07.369
Uh, hi, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3076-0
00:13:07.659 --> 00:13:12.459
Amit decide first of all, good
afternoon and I just need to ask

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3076-1
00:13:12.459 --> 00:13:16.509
you one question that is like
question numbers like C

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3076-2
00:13:16.509 --> 00:13:19.209
considering random Metrics 5 Pro
7.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3119-0
00:13:19.379 --> 00:13:24.594
If for question of a you have
you told that write a code

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3079-0
00:13:19.689 --> 00:13:19.849
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3119-1
00:13:24.594 --> 00:13:30.268
taking an input metrics of size
M in M cross N so like fourth

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3119-2
00:13:30.268 --> 00:13:34.569
question number are we when we
write the code?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3144-0
00:13:35.069 --> 00:13:41.427
Uh, is it necessary to like
denote everything with MN or we

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3144-1
00:13:41.427 --> 00:13:44.819
can they can actual metrics and?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3156-0
00:13:46.039 --> 00:13:48.359
Yeah, I think I answered the
question just now now.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3153-0
00:13:46.749 --> 00:13:47.209
Like the.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3162-0
00:13:49.979 --> 00:13:50.569
Uh, sorry.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3168-0
00:13:50.579 --> 00:13:52.159
Actually, I joined little late.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3173-0
00:13:52.169 --> 00:13:53.709
That's why I missed it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3231-0
00:13:54.169 --> 00:13:58.879
I'm sorry, but due to some
internal yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3185-0
00:13:55.679 --> 00:13:56.309
No issues.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3191-0
00:13:56.319 --> 00:13:57.129
You don't have to be sorry.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3203-0
00:13:59.179 --> 00:14:00.869
Should I write something and
show it to you?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3205-0
00:14:01.989 --> 00:14:02.759
Please, please.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3216-0
00:14:02.959 --> 00:14:03.459
Thank you, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3230-0
00:14:03.469 --> 00:14:06.299
Please it will be helpful for
us.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3228-0
00:14:03.859 --> 00:14:05.209
I so that will be better Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3232-0
00:14:04.729 --> 00:14:07.369
Here you equal to input input.

Yes, yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3310-0
00:14:51.169 --> 00:14:53.569
Yeah, I want that.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3318-0
00:14:54.579 --> 00:14:55.969
I don't know very much.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3328-0
00:14:56.319 --> 00:14:59.599
OK, so you can input a matrix of
says M crossing.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3364-0
00:15:01.699 --> 00:15:10.456
OK, so if you want to say and
Randolph UH-5 comma 7, it'll say

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3338-0
00:15:01.799 --> 00:15:02.319
And they got.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3347-0
00:15:07.129 --> 00:15:07.859

00:15:10.456 --> 00:15:12.819
random 5 comma 7.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3366-0
00:15:10.699 --> 00:15:11.699
Alex will learn something.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3373-0
00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:15.019
So you have got everything
captured in a correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3387-0
00:15:16.909 --> 00:15:17.239
That.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3379-0
00:15:20.319 --> 00:15:20.449
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3380-0
00:15:21.199 --> 00:15:21.449
B.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3383-0
00:15:21.459 --> 00:15:23.279
Equal to import.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3395-0
00:15:26.869 --> 00:15:31.249
Import vector B of size 5.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3405-0
00:15:37.849 --> 00:15:38.969
So what would be the?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3414-0
00:15:39.069 --> 00:15:42.859
I will say this is Randolph, 5
comma one.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3424-0
00:15:45.159 --> 00:15:47.719
Now what is BI have got A&amp;B
correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3431-0
00:15:51.049 --> 00:15:51.169
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3439-0
00:15:51.659 --> 00:15:52.239
Right, right.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3451-0
00:15:52.519 --> 00:15:56.439
I I can I can change my code
anytime of of my choice.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3445-0
00:15:53.329 --> 00:15:53.489
So.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3455-0
00:15:56.449 --> 00:15:58.079
A is M crossing.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3464-0
00:15:58.119 --> 00:15:59.659
I could have given for example.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3474-0
00:15:59.669 --> 00:16:03.069
This is a Rand of three comma
six.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3487-0
00:16:03.079 --> 00:16:06.399
Also, this will give you 3
classics now.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3494-0
00:16:06.409 --> 00:16:07.859
I've written in the most generic
way, correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3501-0
00:16:12.479 --> 00:16:12.579
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3502-0
00:16:13.199 --> 00:16:13.539
Is that?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3505-0
00:16:13.309 --> 00:16:13.759
Good ANKUR.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3509-0
00:16:15.589 --> 00:16:16.009
That's it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3543-0
00:16:16.019 --> 00:16:21.226
That is what is required and we
well, you you have you have

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3543-1
00:16:21.226 --> 00:16:25.999
input B so you can input
whatever B you want his size.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3531-0
00:16:21.669 --> 00:16:21.849
No.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3565-0
00:16:26.169 --> 00:16:31.502
Now as I should be 3, so
Randolph 3 comma one, I'll get

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3565-1
00:16:31.502 --> 00:16:34.359
the 333 row one column vector.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3574-0
00:16:34.369 --> 00:16:35.999
Here what is the problem?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3585-0
00:16:36.149 --> 00:16:37.339
I worked in the most generic
way.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3612-0
00:16:36.849 --> 00:16:41.449
So, but size of five is there
right input be of size 5?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3599-0
00:16:40.539 --> 00:16:40.799
Alright.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3602-0
00:16:40.809 --> 00:16:41.429
Bye bye.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3609-0
00:16:41.609 --> 00:16:42.299
No, no, no.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3624-0
00:16:41.829 --> 00:16:44.629
Alright, bye bye and the
example.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3618-0
00:16:42.309 --> 00:16:43.089
It's an example.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3621-0
00:16:44.089 --> 00:16:44.609
OK, good.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3626-0
00:16:45.369 --> 00:16:45.819
Ohk.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3628-0

OK, OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3639-0

OK, got it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3649-0
00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:48.759
Now that is what you need to
write.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3656-0
00:16:49.009 --> 00:16:49.499

OK. OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3679-0
00:16:56.089 --> 00:16:59.650
Write it in the genetic form and
you will be able to get it

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3674-0
00:16:57.019 --> 00:16:57.219
Right.

00:17:07.909 --> 00:17:12.509
So no discussions about this
thing anymore.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3699-0
00:17:13.139 --> 00:17:13.709
Take care.

00:17:13.769 --> 00:17:16.309
So I will just go to lecture
three.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3716-0
00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:17.919
I think I left somewhere here.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3724-0

Doing something with Cauchy
Schwarz inequality.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3750-0
00:17:32.259 --> 00:17:34.219
Now, should I give an overview
of lecture 3?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3752-0
00:17:35.789 --> 00:17:36.299

Yes, Sir. Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3866-0
00:18:25.659 --> 00:18:26.169
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3878-0
00:18:25.879 --> 00:18:26.769
Yes, yes, clearly.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3875-0
00:18:26.179 --> 00:18:26.419
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3886-0
00:18:26.529 --> 00:18:31.339
OK, so I defined something
called as an inner product.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3894-0
00:18:34.919 --> 00:18:36.349
See, you have been given.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3912-0
00:18:36.459 --> 00:18:41.930
You have one dubba or love
interest, so there is a vector

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3912-1
00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:42.119
X.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3916-0
00:18:42.129 --> 00:18:42.859
There is a vector.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3926-0
00:18:42.869 --> 00:18:45.299
Why there is a vector Z and so
on?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3945-0
00:18:45.309 --> 00:18:49.639
It is full of vectors now all
they want these.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3970-0
00:18:49.649 --> 00:18:54.081
I just want, uh, some some kind
of scalar coming out of these

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3970-1
00:18:54.081 --> 00:18:57.299
vectors to measure the length of
the vector.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/3977-0
00:18:57.309 --> 00:18:58.859
For example, the length of the
vector.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4012-0
00:18:59.289 --> 00:19:06.328
So if I just tell you that there
is a vector called minus 1234

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4012-1
00:19:06.328 --> 00:19:12.809
minus 57169 minus 22, does it
convey some meaning to you?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4017-0
00:19:19.429 --> 00:19:19.689
No.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4027-0
00:19:21.359 --> 00:19:22.979
It doesn't convey some meaning
to you, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4037-0
00:19:23.949 --> 00:19:26.859
So now I want some notion of uh
linked.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4049-0
00:19:28.859 --> 00:19:32.449
OK, now this is given by norm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4056-0
00:19:33.209 --> 00:19:34.359
Now, what is a norm?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4075-0
00:19:34.369 --> 00:19:37.478
Say you have several norms, so
there was one norm which I said

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4075-1
00:19:37.478 --> 00:19:38.219
that is called.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4078-0
00:19:38.229 --> 00:19:39.279
Man had a knob.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4094-0
00:19:39.709 --> 00:19:44.849
This is nothing but Sigma part
of all the elements here.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4131-0
00:19:45.979 --> 00:19:50.267
So model of this is I equal to 1
to north in this example it will

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4131-1
00:19:50.267 --> 00:19:54.425
be more of minus one plus mod of
two plus mod of three plus all

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4131-2
00:19:54.425 --> 00:19:56.829
they have to mod of minus 22.
Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4140-0
00:20:00.479 --> 00:20:02.699
Yes, it will be delayed.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4141-0
00:20:02.519 --> 00:20:03.819
Now what?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4155-0
00:20:08.779 --> 00:20:09.079
Go ahead.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4179-0
00:20:09.149 --> 00:20:09.279
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4186-0
00:20:10.029 --> 00:20:14.431
Said what you have written, the
at starting one more model

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4181-0
00:20:10.379 --> 00:20:11.419
It will be till end, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4186-1
00:20:14.431 --> 00:20:14.879
facts.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4196-0
00:20:16.029 --> 00:20:19.459
No, no, this is the the you take
all the components of X.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4235-0
00:20:24.799 --> 00:20:31.789
So if X is is nothing but X1X2,
that's what I told you.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4225-0
00:20:26.179 --> 00:20:26.659
OK, OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4216-0
00:20:26.389 --> 00:20:27.479
So what is the goal, Sir?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4228-0
00:20:27.489 --> 00:20:28.569
What are we trying to achieve
here?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4253-0
00:20:32.259 --> 00:20:34.499
What we're trying to achieve is
you are we cannot.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4257-0
00:20:33.949 --> 00:20:35.019
Who concluded distance?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4263-0
00:20:35.939 --> 00:20:38.069
Yeah, there's some notion of
distance there.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4278-0
00:20:38.639 --> 00:20:42.020
Some notion of where they lie
and some notion of

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4278-1
00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:44.849
orthogonality, orthonormality,
etcetera.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4303-0
00:20:45.079 --> 00:20:48.641
Now we need some concept of link
there so that the concept length

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4303-1
00:20:48.641 --> 00:20:50.369
is got by something called norm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4309-0
00:20:50.749 --> 00:20:51.809
Now, what is a norm?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4321-0
00:20:51.819 --> 00:20:55.389
A norm is something which will
follow some basic principles.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4360-0
00:20:55.399 --> 00:20:59.862
What are the basic principles
norm of any vector will be more

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4360-1
00:20:59.862 --> 00:21:04.181
than equal to 0 now norm of X
equal to zero will imply X is

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4360-2
00:21:04.181 --> 00:21:05.549
equal to 0. Agreed.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4368-0
00:21:07.339 --> 00:21:07.459
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4367-0
00:21:07.409 --> 00:21:07.589
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4371-0
00:21:07.869 --> 00:21:08.269
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4395-0
00:21:09.259 --> 00:21:13.295
Now when they write this, it
looks very simple, but I will

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4395-1
00:21:13.295 --> 00:21:16.989
try to tell you distinguish two
kinds of numbers now.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4407-0
00:21:17.079 --> 00:21:20.189
This is going to be a scale, R0
agreed.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4410-0
00:21:22.079 --> 00:21:22.209
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4419-0
00:21:23.649 --> 00:21:23.789
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4420-0
00:21:24.059 --> 00:21:24.219
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4492-0
00:21:24.269 --> 00:21:28.933
This is a scalar 0, whereas this
is a rental 0, so you have to be

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4447-0
00:21:26.109 --> 00:21:29.479
Yes, this is the vector zero,
yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4492-1
00:21:28.933 --> 00:21:33.104
very careful because in the
notebook in the book they will

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4492-2
00:21:33.104 --> 00:21:37.486
write it as bold zero, which
says it's a vector 0, but in the

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4492-3
00:21:37.486 --> 00:21:41.868
notes which I'm writing I will
not distinguish bold and small

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4492-4
00:21:41.868 --> 00:21:42.999
and normal font.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4519-0
00:21:43.009 --> 00:21:46.456
So I will write it as zero, but
the context should tell you what

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4519-1
00:21:46.456 --> 00:21:48.949
it is, so maybe I should write
this is Skylar.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4530-0
00:21:50.459 --> 00:21:53.509
This is also scalar correct, but
this is vector 0.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4546-0
00:21:55.769 --> 00:21:58.339
Set for something a function to
be a norm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4541-0
00:21:55.959 --> 00:21:56.239
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4553-0
00:21:58.349 --> 00:22:00.579
It should only follow those
three conditions, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4584-0
00:22:00.589 --> 00:22:03.943
It's norm should be scalar
greater than zero and Lambda X

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4584-1
00:22:03.943 --> 00:22:06.719
norm is equal to norm of Lambda
into norm of X.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4610-0
00:22:05.789 --> 00:22:10.706
So norm of Lambda X should be
equal to mod Lambda times norm

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4610-1
00:22:10.706 --> 00:22:11.109
of X.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4635-0
00:22:11.919 --> 00:22:16.494
Correct and 3rd is the Cauchy
Schwartz that the the inner

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4612-0
00:22:12.859 --> 00:22:13.349
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4615-0
00:22:14.019 --> 00:22:14.409
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4637-0
00:22:14.459 --> 00:22:19.348
Now I'm more explicit, right is
less than or equal to norm of X,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4635-1
00:22:16.494 --> 00:22:16.889
yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4637-1
00:22:19.348 --> 00:22:19.649
yes?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4648-0
00:22:21.859 --> 00:22:24.019
These are the three conditions
agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4646-0
00:22:22.419 --> 00:22:22.579
To.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4652-0
00:22:25.269 --> 00:22:25.429
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4668-0
00:22:26.609 --> 00:22:29.861
Now when these three conditions
are satisfied, we call it as a

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4668-1
00:22:29.861 --> 00:22:30.119
norm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4673-0
00:22:30.169 --> 00:22:31.499
Now there are several norms.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4685-0
00:22:31.509 --> 00:22:35.409
So one of the norms is you take
all the components of.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4699-0
00:22:37.089 --> 00:22:39.919
X and take their absolute values
and add them.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4734-0
00:22:40.289 --> 00:22:45.268
So if X equal to XX1X2 up to XN,
you take mod of XI I equal to 1

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4734-1
00:22:45.268 --> 00:22:49.099
to north and this will give you
the the one norm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4745-0
00:22:49.109 --> 00:22:51.539
OK, this is the one norm of X.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4752-0
00:22:52.009 --> 00:22:53.569
Now there is something called 2
norm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4758-0
00:22:54.979 --> 00:22:55.749
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4780-0
00:22:56.049 --> 00:23:01.878
Eggs to this is nothing but
Sigma XI square I equal to 1 to

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4780-1
00:23:01.878 --> 00:23:04.599
N and then you put a square.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4782-0
00:23:04.749 --> 00:23:05.259
Agreed.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4794-0
00:23:05.869 --> 00:23:07.999
Now you can define any not.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4845-0
00:23:08.039 --> 00:23:12.447
Now, once you have this, the
this norm defined on a finite

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4845-1
00:23:12.447 --> 00:23:16.931
dimensional vector space, you
will find that, uh, you don't

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4845-2
00:23:16.931 --> 00:23:21.415
have to work with every norm and
you can do your teams with

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4845-3
00:23:21.415 --> 00:23:25.749
respect to any of the norms and
the others will be equal.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4852-0
00:23:25.759 --> 00:23:28.419
It OK, so there is a small
theorem.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4865-0
00:23:30.239 --> 00:23:39.039
Uh, any two norms on a finite
dimensional.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4870-0
00:23:40.699 --> 00:23:41.449
Vector space.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4877-0
00:23:44.349 --> 00:23:45.209
I eat everything.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4902-0
00:23:47.859 --> 00:23:52.656
Which means if there is a a
theorem, excel and I'm except

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4902-1
00:23:52.656 --> 00:23:55.799
which is we say there is a
statement.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4907-0
00:23:58.029 --> 00:23:58.559
Which is true.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4919-0
00:24:01.419 --> 00:24:04.359
For Norm one or the man had a
knob.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4926-0
00:24:05.479 --> 00:24:07.099
Now this says that the
statement.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4931-0
00:24:09.129 --> 00:24:10.199
He's also true.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4938-0
00:24:12.239 --> 00:24:15.069
But not too agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4964-0
00:24:19.299 --> 00:24:20.779
So that does that mean that?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4968-0
00:24:19.929 --> 00:24:22.579
So, Sir, norm one and Norm 2,
what you defined is same thing.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4996-0
00:24:22.589 --> 00:24:25.206
I mean Norm 2, you just put a
square root and then doing

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4996-1
00:24:25.206 --> 00:24:27.089
square and so same thing, I mean
you're.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/4997-0
00:24:26.689 --> 00:24:27.149
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5011-0
00:24:27.259 --> 00:24:31.988
So, so so you can choose
whichever norm you want and you

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5011-1
00:24:31.988 --> 00:24:32.569
can do.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5043-0
00:24:32.579 --> 00:24:36.268
You can prove some theorem, so I
I have some ten theorems where I

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5043-1
00:24:36.268 --> 00:24:39.677
have proved using norm one the
same 10 theorems are true for

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5043-2
00:24:39.677 --> 00:24:40.069
Norm 2.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5051-0
00:24:40.079 --> 00:24:43.159
Also, I don't have to prove them
separately.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5087-0
00:24:44.059 --> 00:24:47.874
Yeah, but since this is the same
thing, I mean it just so, I

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5079-0
00:24:47.409 --> 00:24:48.289
Right there same thing.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5087-1
00:24:47.874 --> 00:24:50.939
mean, you're doing square root
and N square, so.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5091-0
00:24:51.209 --> 00:24:53.569
I devan that.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5095-0
00:24:53.579 --> 00:24:53.939
Hey, bye bye.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5108-0
00:24:55.489 --> 00:24:56.479
If I take an example.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5111-0
00:24:56.259 --> 00:24:57.219
It's the most players.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5113-0
00:24:57.739 --> 00:24:58.299
Hey Bubba.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5125-0
00:24:58.309 --> 00:25:02.759
Beat the next B equal to minus
123.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5133-0
00:25:03.559 --> 00:25:05.649
Now, what is norm of X1?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5157-0
00:25:06.089 --> 00:25:09.815
This is nothing but a lot of
minus one plus mod of two plus

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5157-1
00:25:09.815 --> 00:25:11.989
mod of three, which is equal to
6.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5159-0
00:25:12.059 --> 00:25:12.549
Agreed.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5183-0
00:25:12.939 --> 00:25:17.641
Now what is more of X2, this is
nothing but sqrt 1 square +2

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5171-0
00:25:13.299 --> 00:25:13.499
Right.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5183-1
00:25:17.641 --> 00:25:19.569
square plus three square.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5197-0
00:25:21.729 --> 00:25:23.069
Equal to sqrt 14.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5202-0
00:25:24.439 --> 00:25:26.249
This is different from 6.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5215-0
00:25:32.009 --> 00:25:32.369
Agreed.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5228-0
00:25:32.289 --> 00:25:35.019
But First Manhattan and second
one is equally in right.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5224-0
00:25:35.419 --> 00:25:36.129
Yeah, correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5240-0
00:25:36.279 --> 00:25:38.429
First one is Manhattan, second
one is Euclidian.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5236-0
00:25:36.719 --> 00:25:36.869
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5255-0
00:25:39.739 --> 00:25:43.422
So I can just one of them in in
type in solving our use case,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5255-1
00:25:43.422 --> 00:25:43.779
right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5268-0
00:25:45.089 --> 00:25:46.469
What I didn't get it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5278-0
00:25:47.319 --> 00:25:51.361
But we can choose any one of
these two to solve our problem,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5278-1
00:25:51.361 --> 00:25:51.759
right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5280-0
00:25:55.939 --> 00:25:56.199
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5310-0
00:25:57.429 --> 00:26:03.981
Umm I am not think that in the
exam if I ask you what if you X

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5310-1
00:26:03.981 --> 00:26:06.269
is equal to minus 123?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5331-0
00:26:07.299 --> 00:26:11.318
What is norm of X1 and you write
this is equal to root 14, you

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5331-1
00:26:11.318 --> 00:26:11.829
get a 0.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5336-0
00:26:17.409 --> 00:26:17.729
Agreed.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5339-0
00:26:18.979 --> 00:26:19.609
OK, got it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5358-0
00:26:20.929 --> 00:26:25.221
I am saying you make a statement
about a theorem about nomics

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5358-1
00:26:25.221 --> 00:26:27.229
with respect to the one norm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5378-0
00:26:28.819 --> 00:26:32.494
Now the state, the same theorem
can be proved with respect to

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5378-1
00:26:32.494 --> 00:26:32.909
Norm 2.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5395-0
00:26:32.919 --> 00:26:36.575
That is not a problem at all,
because all these norms are

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5395-1
00:26:36.575 --> 00:26:37.269
equivalent.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5424-0
00:26:37.599 --> 00:26:40.782
So if you prove a statement with
respect to 1 norm, the statement

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5424-1
00:26:40.782 --> 00:26:43.868
automatically becomes true with
respect to two norm, so that is

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5424-2
00:26:43.868 --> 00:26:45.219
not a problem at all. Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5427-0
00:26:47.239 --> 00:26:47.459
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5435-0
00:26:49.429 --> 00:26:51.119
You I I hope you got it right.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5439-0
00:26:53.709 --> 00:26:54.089
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5444-0
00:26:54.929 --> 00:26:56.349
OK, right.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5449-0
00:26:57.189 --> 00:26:58.699
So this is not now.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5456-0
00:26:58.709 --> 00:27:00.629
Then we studied something about
inner product.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5466-0
00:27:00.639 --> 00:27:03.479
What is inner product of
X&amp;Y?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5473-0
00:27:03.749 --> 00:27:04.579
It is with respect.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5484-0
00:27:04.589 --> 00:27:06.519
This is a left angle and this is
the right angle.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5499-0
00:27:06.649 --> 00:27:12.725
This is defined as X transpose
AY where a is symmetric and

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5499-1
00:27:12.725 --> 00:27:14.579
positive definite.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5534-0
00:27:17.499 --> 00:27:20.509
The symmetric and positive
definite will will be very

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5534-1
00:27:20.509 --> 00:27:23.910
important in all of our things
in this class as soon as from

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5534-2
00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:25.249
the from the next class.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5552-0
00:27:25.749 --> 00:27:28.905
So you be a very clear of what
this symmetric and positive

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5552-1
00:27:28.905 --> 00:27:29.869
definite matrices.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5560-0
00:27:30.219 --> 00:27:32.189
I already told you symmetric
matrices.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5586-0
00:27:32.199 --> 00:27:35.836
I want also told you something
would cost you different

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5586-1
00:27:35.836 --> 00:27:39.669
matrices, so this is this is the
inner product of X&amp;Y.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5610-0
00:27:40.179 --> 00:27:47.388
Now there is a particular case
where you take A to B if AC is

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5610-1
00:27:47.388 --> 00:27:50.179
equal to I then X&amp;Y.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5620-0
00:27:50.229 --> 00:27:53.049
This is will be equal to X
transpose into RIYA.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5630-0
00:27:53.059 --> 00:27:55.139
This is nothing but X transpose
Y mean.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5635-0
00:27:57.309 --> 00:27:57.469
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5638-0
00:27:57.979 --> 00:27:58.129
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5640-0
00:27:58.729 --> 00:28:00.109
Now is I symmetric?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5642-0
00:28:02.369 --> 00:28:02.519
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5653-0
00:28:04.599 --> 00:28:05.439
These are you symmetric.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5651-0
00:28:06.729 --> 00:28:07.079
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5664-0
00:28:07.089 --> 00:28:07.819
Yeah, it's symmetric.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5658-0
00:28:07.779 --> 00:28:08.189
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5668-0
00:28:08.379 --> 00:28:09.379
Is it positive definite?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5665-0
00:28:08.939 --> 00:28:09.099
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5673-0
00:28:11.009 --> 00:28:11.119
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5723-0
00:28:11.799 --> 00:28:17.629
I'm I this part I'm not getting
VENKATA that I'm sorry if a if

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5676-0
00:28:11.879 --> 00:28:12.029
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5686-0
00:28:11.879 --> 00:28:11.999
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5687-0
00:28:12.069 --> 00:28:12.179
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5689-0
00:28:12.159 --> 00:28:12.249
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5698-0
00:28:14.419 --> 00:28:14.829
Which one?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5723-1
00:28:17.629 --> 00:28:22.349
if uh some yellow color E equal
to I if that part.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5717-0
00:28:21.649 --> 00:28:22.479
No problem.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5734-0
00:28:23.219 --> 00:28:26.325
No, no, there is no a local bar
in drifted with the previous

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5734-1
00:28:26.325 --> 00:28:26.529
ink.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5749-0
00:28:27.389 --> 00:28:27.669
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5787-0
00:28:28.539 --> 00:28:31.530
If a equal to I if a is the
identity matrix, then a is

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5759-0
00:28:28.689 --> 00:28:30.879
If he umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5787-1
00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:35.012
symmetric and positive definite,
so I will write the inner part

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5777-0
00:28:34.809 --> 00:28:35.019
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5787-2
00:28:35.012 --> 00:28:38.385
of X&amp;YSX transpose highway,
which is nothing but expert X

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5787-3
00:28:38.385 --> 00:28:38.929
transpose.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5795-0
00:28:38.939 --> 00:28:41.579
Why this is called the DOT
product?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5797-0
00:28:42.829 --> 00:28:43.509
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5799-0
00:28:44.939 --> 00:28:45.279
Agreed.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5802-0
00:28:46.349 --> 00:28:46.829
Hmm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5819-0
00:28:47.359 --> 00:28:51.689
So ax transpose of inverse of Y
is nothing but X transpose Y.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5810-0
00:28:47.689 --> 00:28:47.919
So.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5831-0
00:28:53.079 --> 00:28:55.049
Yeah, because I by is by only
right.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5834-0
00:28:56.389 --> 00:28:57.739
OK, OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5840-0
00:28:57.749 --> 00:28:58.269
Yeah, yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5847-0
00:28:59.649 --> 00:29:00.429
You want an example.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5849-0
00:29:01.689 --> 00:29:02.599
That will be helpful.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5866-0
00:29:06.069 --> 00:29:07.529
So I will take 8.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5862-0
00:29:06.869 --> 00:29:08.719
I use an identity matrix, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5871-0
00:29:08.769 --> 00:29:09.949
I as an identity matrix.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5900-0
00:29:11.439 --> 00:29:17.689
1001 right I become if suppose
cool. OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5896-0
00:29:13.649 --> 00:29:18.069
So 1237, suppose this is a
matrix.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5902-0
00:29:18.079 --> 00:29:18.789
This is symmetric.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5906-0
00:29:19.619 --> 00:29:20.239
Is it symmetric?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5913-0
00:29:22.539 --> 00:29:22.699
No.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5919-0
00:29:23.229 --> 00:29:25.059
It is symmetric is.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5920-0
00:29:23.289 --> 00:29:25.289
No, no, no, no, no.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5923-0
00:29:28.159 --> 00:29:28.519
Right now.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5941-0
00:29:30.449 --> 00:29:31.789
Yes, this is symmetric.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5940-0
00:29:31.369 --> 00:29:31.589
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5942-0
00:29:31.519 --> 00:29:31.999
It is.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5945-0
00:29:31.679 --> 00:29:33.709
OK, so this is symmetric.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5949-0
00:29:34.219 --> 00:29:35.259
Is it positive definite?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5952-0
00:29:38.139 --> 00:29:38.789
Definite.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5957-0
00:29:42.749 --> 00:29:43.629
Umm, I don't.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5960-0
00:29:44.569 --> 00:29:44.709
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5971-0
00:29:45.699 --> 00:29:48.139
No, I told you two things are
positive.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5992-0
00:29:48.149 --> 00:29:51.917
Definiteness one is this element
should be more than 0 and the

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5992-1
00:29:51.917 --> 00:29:54.669
determinant of this should be
more than zero.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/5999-0
00:29:54.919 --> 00:29:55.949
What is determinant of this?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6010-0
00:29:55.959 --> 00:29:56.879
This is minus 2, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6014-0
00:29:56.739 --> 00:29:57.329
Minus 2.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6015-0
00:29:56.969 --> 00:29:57.539
Minus 2.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6018-0
00:29:59.049 --> 00:29:59.829
Now check this.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6036-0
00:30:04.069 --> 00:30:05.249
Is it now posture? Definite.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6037-0
00:30:05.789 --> 00:30:05.909
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6040-0
00:30:06.609 --> 00:30:07.109
It is.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6039-0
00:30:06.779 --> 00:30:06.919
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6048-0
00:30:08.439 --> 00:30:10.709
Big so this is positive
definite.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6057-0
00:30:10.789 --> 00:30:13.459
So I defined between two
vectors, X&amp;Y.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6083-0
00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:18.577
This is nothing but extra
aspose, which is nothing but

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6083-1
00:30:18.577 --> 00:30:20.809
X1X2 times 1227 and then.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6091-0
00:30:21.449 --> 00:30:25.309
And why one bike agree?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6121-0
00:30:26.819 --> 00:30:29.811
Said one question that the
positive definiteness check this

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6099-0
00:30:28.069 --> 00:30:28.249
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6121-1
00:30:29.811 --> 00:30:32.454
is exhaustive one that
determinant should be greater

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6121-2
00:30:32.454 --> 00:30:34.749
than zero and diagonal elements
are positive.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6124-0
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.449
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6126-0
00:30:35.639 --> 00:30:35.859
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6141-0
00:30:36.769 --> 00:30:39.697
I mean, will it always hold that
such a matrix will be positive

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6147-0
00:30:36.889 --> 00:30:37.329
How are you?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6141-1
00:30:39.697 --> 00:30:40.109
definite?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6142-0
00:30:41.419 --> 00:30:41.579
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6144-0
00:30:43.349 --> 00:30:43.589
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6150-0
00:30:45.989 --> 00:30:46.269
Right.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6199-0
00:30:47.609 --> 00:30:50.689
I mean because in some cases in
book they have trying to prove

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6199-1
00:30:50.689 --> 00:30:53.476
it positive definite by taking
extra expose a X and then

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6199-2
00:30:53.476 --> 00:30:56.019
showing that this equation will
always be positive.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6193-0
00:30:54.479 --> 00:30:57.199
Yeah, that is, yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6249-0
00:30:57.269 --> 00:31:03.347
So you can do it for this this
this also should I should I tell

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6249-1
00:31:03.347 --> 00:31:09.140
you that if you take extrasport
KX, this is nothing but X1X2

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6230-0
00:31:03.909 --> 00:31:04.479
And didn't.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6249-2
00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:11.799
times 1227 times 61X2 agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6256-0
00:31:12.519 --> 00:31:12.809
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6261-0
00:31:13.729 --> 00:31:15.279
So this is nothing but X1X2.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6280-0
00:31:18.069 --> 00:31:21.629
X1 plus 2X22X1 plus 7X2.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6307-0
00:31:22.949 --> 00:31:29.853
This is nothing but excellent
square plus 2X1X2 plus 2X1X2

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6284-0
00:31:23.119 --> 00:31:23.369
Right.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6307-1
00:31:29.853 --> 00:31:32.779
plus 7X2 square, correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6315-0
00:31:34.469 --> 00:31:34.669
Yep.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6327-0
00:31:35.559 --> 00:31:38.959
This is equal to X 1 ^2 + 4 X
1X2.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6335-0
00:31:40.019 --> 00:31:41.679
Plus 7X2 square, correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6349-0
00:31:43.309 --> 00:31:44.239
Hmm, that's correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6363-0
00:31:43.889 --> 00:31:49.659
This is nothing but X 1 ^2 + 4 X
1X2 plus 4X2 square plus 3X2

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6363-1
00:31:49.659 --> 00:31:51.149
square, correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6367-0
00:31:53.359 --> 00:31:53.689
Yep.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6371-0
00:31:53.699 --> 00:31:53.909
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6392-0
00:31:53.919 --> 00:31:56.039
Now we can, I think, combine
them and then.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6393-0
00:31:55.079 --> 00:31:57.029
This is X1 plus 2X2.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6404-0
00:31:57.039 --> 00:32:00.009
The whole square plus 3X2
square, correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6443-0
00:31:57.719 --> 00:31:57.889
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6402-0
00:32:01.149 --> 00:32:01.379
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6406-0
00:32:01.389 --> 00:32:01.679
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6419-0
00:32:01.749 --> 00:32:02.519
Now they will be.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6430-0
00:32:02.889 --> 00:32:03.969
This will always be positive.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6425-0
00:32:03.049 --> 00:32:04.329
This is a quite often number.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6431-0
00:32:04.339 --> 00:32:04.989
Can it be 0?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6440-0
00:32:07.659 --> 00:32:09.279
No, now this equation will be
positive.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6451-0
00:32:12.119 --> 00:32:12.399
Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6454-0
00:32:13.449 --> 00:32:13.649
Yep.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6471-0
00:32:13.809 --> 00:32:18.573
Can you go a little bit up just
this question only this question

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6465-0
00:32:16.979 --> 00:32:17.239
Uh.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6471-1
00:32:18.573 --> 00:32:20.259
only can you go put up?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6470-0
00:32:19.899 --> 00:32:20.039
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6480-0
00:32:22.609 --> 00:32:24.559
I just want to note down the
question.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6494-0
00:32:30.459 --> 00:32:32.909
So that when you say the X
transport EXE.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6500-0
00:32:33.129 --> 00:32:33.359
Hmm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6503-0
00:32:33.219 --> 00:32:35.149
Ohh, what are we trying to?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6509-0
00:32:35.479 --> 00:32:36.199
I mean prove here.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6516-0
00:32:37.839 --> 00:32:38.869
It's supposed to symmetric.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6551-0
00:32:40.379 --> 00:32:45.501
I have saying that if you have a
positive a positive definite

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6551-1
00:32:45.501 --> 00:32:50.209
matrix whatever X you consider
being X is negative has a

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6551-2
00:32:50.209 --> 00:32:53.349
combination of negative and
positive.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6604-0
00:32:53.559 --> 00:32:57.454
Whatever it is, extra transpose
X is 1, number is scalar, which

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6604-1
00:32:57.454 --> 00:33:01.106
is always more than zero and
it's transpose X equal to zero

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6604-2
00:33:01.106 --> 00:33:04.514
will immediately say that you
piece of poster different

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6604-3
00:33:04.514 --> 00:33:07.619
metrics X transpose X equal to
zero will increase.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6610-0
00:33:07.629 --> 00:33:08.869
Simply imply that X equal to 0.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6613-0
00:33:14.759 --> 00:33:15.029
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6614-0
00:33:15.649 --> 00:33:16.009
Agreed.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6616-0
00:33:22.479 --> 00:33:22.799
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6625-0
00:33:24.679 --> 00:33:27.119
Now there is something like **.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6632-0
00:33:28.459 --> 00:33:30.189
This is called nomics.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6634-0
00:33:30.199 --> 00:33:31.859
The whole square OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6642-0
00:33:34.229 --> 00:33:35.489
If you take X with exa.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6644-0
00:33:41.679 --> 00:33:41.919
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6651-0
00:33:44.099 --> 00:33:44.239
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6656-0
00:33:45.469 --> 00:33:46.139
This is norm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6663-0
00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:47.039
It's the whole square.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6682-0
00:33:47.409 --> 00:33:52.969
Now you can prove a lot of
properties with this and and one

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6682-1
00:33:52.969 --> 00:33:57.139
property which keeps coming very
very often.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6692-0
00:33:59.549 --> 00:34:01.299
He's about A and a transpose A.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6695-0
00:34:02.899 --> 00:34:03.099
Now.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6706-0
00:34:05.649 --> 00:34:08.099
A and a transpose a share.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6711-0
00:34:08.109 --> 00:34:09.889
A lot of properties, you know
that.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6719-0
00:34:16.459 --> 00:34:17.119
Should I tell you?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6723-0
00:34:18.809 --> 00:34:19.009
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6724-0
00:34:19.399 --> 00:34:19.819
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6753-0
00:34:21.239 --> 00:34:21.479
The.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6736-0
00:34:21.979 --> 00:34:24.029
Uh, in the assignment I had
asked.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6750-0
00:34:24.039 --> 00:34:27.919
Now, what are the the general
solutions of a X equal to 0?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6752-0
00:34:28.869 --> 00:34:29.189
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6754-0
00:34:30.199 --> 00:34:30.749
Suppose.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6770-0
00:34:32.939 --> 00:34:38.909
Suppose you know one excel such
that A transpose AE.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6790-0
00:34:39.179 --> 00:34:45.291
Sorry, I will go to this next
step again such that X equal to

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6790-1
00:34:45.291 --> 00:34:45.489
0.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6795-0
00:34:45.879 --> 00:34:46.719
Now what is X ^2?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6801-0
00:34:49.529 --> 00:34:50.069
Null space.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6812-0
00:34:52.309 --> 00:34:53.969
So ex belongs to the null space
of a, correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6815-0
00:34:56.009 --> 00:34:56.159
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6855-0
00:34:57.229 --> 00:35:01.285
OK, now what can you say if you
AX equal to zero, you can

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6855-1
00:35:01.285 --> 00:35:04.922
multiply both sides by a
transpose, so you'll get a

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6855-2
00:35:04.922 --> 00:35:08.979
transpose a X equal to a
transpose 0 which is equal to 0.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6860-0
00:35:09.449 --> 00:35:10.479
So X belongs to what?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6883-0
00:35:14.499 --> 00:35:16.309
Null space of A transpose also.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6882-0
00:35:15.279 --> 00:35:16.269
That's for the 2nd.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6889-0
00:35:17.219 --> 00:35:19.239
Now space off A transpose a
correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6891-0
00:35:20.749 --> 00:35:20.889
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6916-0
00:35:22.559 --> 00:35:26.865
So X belongs to null space of A
will imply takes belongs to null

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6916-1
00:35:26.865 --> 00:35:28.919
space of a transpose a correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6919-0
00:35:29.639 --> 00:35:29.909
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6934-0
00:35:31.099 --> 00:35:36.389
Now let by belong to null space
of a transpose A.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6947-0
00:35:37.629 --> 00:35:41.479
Between imply a transpose AY
equal to 0, correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6949-0
00:35:44.079 --> 00:35:44.209
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6951-0
00:35:46.059 --> 00:35:46.219
Yep.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6978-0
00:35:48.749 --> 00:35:52.862
So if we multiply both sides by
white transpose, I'll get white

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6978-1
00:35:52.862 --> 00:35:55.819
transpose a transpose AY equal
to 0, correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/6983-0
00:35:59.689 --> 00:36:00.009
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7001-0
00:36:01.649 --> 00:36:07.361
This is nothing but this implies
AY transpose AYE equal to 0,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7001-1
00:36:07.361 --> 00:36:08.099
correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7005-0
00:36:11.579 --> 00:36:11.739
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7007-0
00:36:11.759 --> 00:36:12.059
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7017-0
00:36:13.799 --> 00:36:15.499
Now I told you something.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7022-0
00:36:15.879 --> 00:36:17.959
And what is Yatra?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7032-0
00:36:18.039 --> 00:36:21.139
See what is this ***?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7038-0
00:36:21.149 --> 00:36:22.859
This is extra transpose X,
correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7065-0
00:36:28.949 --> 00:36:33.359
Many have the underlying metrics
is identity then X transpose X.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7068-0
00:36:30.649 --> 00:36:34.239
So this is ah, so this is
nothing.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7080-0
00:36:34.249 --> 00:36:38.719
But now I'm of a Y square is
equal to 0, correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7083-0
00:36:41.629 --> 00:36:41.829
Yep.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7103-0
00:36:43.569 --> 00:36:48.939
Now when can none of every the
horse could be equal to 0?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7121-0
00:36:48.949 --> 00:36:52.409
This will imply normal AY equal
to 0, then can the norm be 0?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7136-0
00:36:54.439 --> 00:36:55.269
When you, I will.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7144-0
00:36:54.439 --> 00:36:56.129
Then if I self is 0.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7139-0
00:36:54.509 --> 00:36:55.289
Whenever you visit.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7158-0
00:36:56.449 --> 00:36:59.746
When AY equal to zero, which
implies Y belongs to null space

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7158-1
00:36:59.746 --> 00:37:00.449
of a correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7162-0
00:37:04.239 --> 00:37:04.379
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7164-0
00:37:05.159 --> 00:37:05.609
Angry.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7189-0
00:37:06.679 --> 00:37:10.272
So whenever something belongs to
null space of, yeah, it'll

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7189-1
00:37:10.272 --> 00:37:12.489
belong to null space of a
transpose.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7191-0
00:37:12.499 --> 00:37:12.699
A.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7216-0
00:37:12.709 --> 00:37:15.935
Whenever something belongs to
null space of a transpose, it

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7216-1
00:37:15.935 --> 00:37:18.409
become like belong to nexpose
nullspace of a.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7231-0
00:37:18.639 --> 00:37:22.297
Therefore, null space of a
transpose A is nothing but the

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7231-1
00:37:22.297 --> 00:37:23.559
null space is not E.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7253-0
00:37:26.849 --> 00:37:31.713
VENKATA from the third last
step, how did we get the norm of

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7239-0
00:37:28.059 --> 00:37:28.219
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7253-1
00:37:31.713 --> 00:37:33.069
a wise queries 0?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7255-0
00:37:33.839 --> 00:37:34.569
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7267-0
00:37:36.399 --> 00:37:40.979
Sure, it could take normal
Bixby.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7274-0
00:37:40.989 --> 00:37:42.629
This is nothing but X transpose.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7277-0
00:37:42.639 --> 00:37:42.799
Why?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7284-0
00:37:42.809 --> 00:37:43.909
I told you initially like.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7287-0
00:37:43.179 --> 00:37:44.819
Why? But?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7286-0
00:37:44.539 --> 00:37:44.679
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7317-0
00:37:45.779 --> 00:37:49.960
So if I put Y equal to XI will
get norm of X equal to

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7317-1
00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:53.599
extrasport X which is nothing
but norm expose.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7330-0
00:37:57.259 --> 00:37:57.569
Buddy.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7334-0
00:37:57.329 --> 00:37:59.679
Extra answer sex becomes norm of
X square.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7335-0
00:38:00.709 --> 00:38:00.849
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7337-0
00:38:03.299 --> 00:38:03.569
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7339-0
00:38:06.599 --> 00:38:06.859
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7341-0
00:38:11.079 --> 00:38:11.209
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7346-0
00:38:14.709 --> 00:38:15.459
But how, Sir?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7353-0
00:38:15.469 --> 00:38:16.899
How is this a transfer?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7361-0
00:38:16.909 --> 00:38:18.489
Success equals to norm of X ^2.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7372-0
00:38:21.979 --> 00:38:23.309
That's what it defined earlier,
yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7386-0
00:38:42.129 --> 00:38:42.409
Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7398-0
00:38:42.469 --> 00:38:46.151
No, but how can we derive from
this expense expense expense

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7398-1
00:38:46.151 --> 00:38:47.809
equals to norm of X square?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7428-0
00:38:49.479 --> 00:38:54.827
X transpose X, so I told you not
this is nothing but XYX

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7428-1
00:38:54.827 --> 00:38:57.549
transpose Y and what is XNXX?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7439-0
00:38:57.559 --> 00:38:59.159
This is nothing but norm is a
whole square.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7460-0
00:39:05.459 --> 00:39:06.279
Not getting Singh.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7464-0
00:39:05.499 --> 00:39:08.709
Said, I think there's a are so
many things to absorb.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7459-0
00:39:05.649 --> 00:39:06.379
If you use it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7491-0
00:39:08.719 --> 00:39:13.600
So, umm, can we go a little
slower and you have explained a

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7475-0
00:39:09.629 --> 00:39:09.829
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7479-0
00:39:10.489 --> 00:39:11.129
What are the things?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7491-1
00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:14.739
lot of things.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7498-0
00:39:16.399 --> 00:39:17.609
No, not that.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7495-0
00:39:16.469 --> 00:39:16.899
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7522-0
00:39:17.309 --> 00:39:21.711
So I am saying if you say
something about the null space

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7522-1
00:39:21.711 --> 00:39:26.036
of a then I can conclude
something about the null space

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7522-2
00:39:26.036 --> 00:39:27.349
of a transpose A.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7524-0
00:39:28.639 --> 00:39:28.959
Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7534-0
00:39:34.459 --> 00:39:35.599
No, no, no, no, no problem.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7535-0
00:39:37.579 --> 00:39:37.759
What?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7537-0
00:39:46.559 --> 00:39:47.049
Those.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7549-0
00:39:49.989 --> 00:39:53.729
In the last class I showed you
this uh, stuff.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7553-0
00:40:03.709 --> 00:40:04.069
Yep.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7578-0
00:40:06.189 --> 00:40:09.079
In the Dot party case, it's
transpose, Y is nothing but

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7578-1
00:40:09.079 --> 00:40:10.989
Sigma I equal to 1 to North XI
by 8.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7581-0
00:40:10.999 --> 00:40:11.579
You remember this.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7586-0
00:40:12.869 --> 00:40:13.119
I know.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7615-0
00:40:14.649 --> 00:40:18.632
If you take this Y as X, will
you not get an X 1 ^2 + X two

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7615-1
00:40:18.632 --> 00:40:20.359
square up to X and square?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7622-0
00:40:24.009 --> 00:40:25.199
Correct, correct, correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7627-0
00:40:25.209 --> 00:40:26.019
Correct. Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7652-0
00:40:25.429 --> 00:40:29.229
That is basically nothing but
the normal square, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7641-0
00:40:28.659 --> 00:40:29.089
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7646-0
00:40:29.099 --> 00:40:30.229
The norm of X ^2.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7650-0
00:40:30.239 --> 00:40:31.049
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7664-0
00:40:30.999 --> 00:40:32.709
That's what I'm saying now.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7663-0
00:40:31.059 --> 00:40:31.729
Yeah, makes sense.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7714-0
00:40:32.719 --> 00:40:36.455
If you replace the text with a
Y, you will get the same thing

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7714-1
00:40:36.455 --> 00:40:40.190
as a Y, the whole square equal
to zero, which will imply norm

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7714-2
00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:43.806
of AY equal to 0 AY equal to 0
implies why we belong to the

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7714-3
00:40:43.806 --> 00:40:44.469
null space.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7735-0
00:40:44.479 --> 00:40:47.324
OK, so null space of a
transpose, a null space of are

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7735-1
00:40:47.324 --> 00:40:48.589
one and the same things.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7742-0
00:40:48.599 --> 00:40:49.329
That's what is a claim.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7760-0
00:40:53.089 --> 00:40:55.649
Sir, can you please scroll
between words?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7758-0
00:40:53.109 --> 00:40:54.209
Yes, that makes sense.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7764-0
00:40:55.409 --> 00:40:55.569
What?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7768-0
00:40:55.979 --> 00:40:56.989
Just wanted one thing.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7776-0
00:40:58.209 --> 00:41:00.489
You'll be decided the high
secret.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7782-0
00:41:00.499 --> 00:41:01.559
Now you be little louder.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7783-0
00:41:01.099 --> 00:41:01.619
Important.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7790-0
00:41:05.199 --> 00:41:06.589
Tell me where is the problem.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7816-0
00:41:14.269 --> 00:41:17.706
So can you explain with the some
example like explain for the

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7816-1
00:41:17.706 --> 00:41:19.869
other things like the smaller
metrics.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7819-0
00:41:21.139 --> 00:41:22.709
Yeah, why not.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7825-0
00:41:26.049 --> 00:41:26.549
Door.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7829-0
00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:28.379
Let me take example.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7838-0
00:41:34.289 --> 00:41:36.559
1122, OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7849-0
00:41:39.299 --> 00:41:42.039
X1X2 equal to 00.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7861-0
00:41:43.109 --> 00:41:46.019
Now suppose I find exam X1X2 for
this.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7866-0
00:41:46.029 --> 00:41:46.819
This is satisfied.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7874-0
00:41:47.249 --> 00:41:48.399
What is it X1X2 called?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7884-0
00:41:53.479 --> 00:41:54.019
Null space.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7888-0
00:41:54.589 --> 00:41:55.179
Off what?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7894-0
00:41:56.049 --> 00:41:56.989
Of the matrix A.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7896-0
00:41:57.479 --> 00:41:59.139
Yeah, I've got the correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7915-0
00:42:02.369 --> 00:42:03.669
In this case, you tell me what
it is.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7926-0
00:42:02.999 --> 00:42:09.486
Uh, so null space of metrics A
is uh this I'm getting confused

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7926-1
00:42:09.486 --> 00:42:10.619
when cases.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7930-0
00:42:10.629 --> 00:42:11.289
I'm sorry.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7939-0
00:42:11.739 --> 00:42:14.829
Null space of of metrics A means
what?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7948-0
00:42:14.889 --> 00:42:15.519
It's a null.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7963-0
00:42:16.819 --> 00:42:22.819
I'll space up here is solutions
to A equal to 0.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7987-0
00:42:23.749 --> 00:42:27.519
OK, so any umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7985-0
00:42:25.369 --> 00:42:28.490
So if you want to solve this,
you will get only one and one

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/7985-1
00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:28.959
equation.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8012-0
00:42:28.969 --> 00:42:33.682
It says X1 plus X2 equal to
zero, which implies X1 equal to

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8012-1
00:42:33.682 --> 00:42:34.389
minus X2.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8016-0
00:42:34.449 --> 00:42:35.169
Minus X2.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8032-0
00:42:35.369 --> 00:42:40.150
Is it for example it is, it is
governed by something like some

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8032-1
00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:42.199
Lambda times 1 -, 1, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8049-0
00:42:49.939 --> 00:42:50.479
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8046-0
00:42:50.069 --> 00:42:50.489
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8045-0
00:42:50.099 --> 00:42:50.439
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8050-0
00:42:51.079 --> 00:42:51.579
Yes, yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8052-0
00:42:52.179 --> 00:42:52.389
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8053-0
00:42:52.339 --> 00:42:52.449
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8061-0
00:42:53.439 --> 00:42:56.129
OK, So what is the null space?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8072-0
00:42:56.439 --> 00:42:59.219
It is generated by this vector 1
-, 1 correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8079-0
00:43:01.239 --> 00:43:02.349
What minus one?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8089-0
00:43:04.879 --> 00:43:06.489
Lumber times of 1 -.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8113-0
00:43:06.499 --> 00:43:11.750
One so this one we said just one
doubt, this X1 is equal to minus

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8113-1
00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:13.819
X2 is Lambda times 1 -, 1.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8135-0
00:43:15.689 --> 00:43:18.619
What we have done, this is
limited.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8125-0
00:43:17.659 --> 00:43:17.989
Whatever.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8156-0
00:43:17.999 --> 00:43:21.713
What in in case you want X1 plus
X2 equal to 0, the X one should

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8156-1
00:43:21.713 --> 00:43:22.799
be minus X2, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8153-0
00:43:23.159 --> 00:43:23.729
This is here.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8167-0
00:43:23.739 --> 00:43:26.199
Yeah, correct this I I
understood up to you. Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8186-0
00:43:24.749 --> 00:43:28.894
OK, so that means you take take
whatever component you want in

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8186-1
00:43:28.894 --> 00:43:30.539
next two and negate that.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8201-0
00:43:30.549 --> 00:43:33.009
If I take minus one here you
take a + 1 here.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8206-0
00:43:33.789 --> 00:43:33.989
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8214-0
00:43:34.869 --> 00:43:37.219
That will be a solution if you
take a -, 4.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8222-0
00:43:37.229 --> 00:43:38.929
Here you take a + 4 here,
correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8234-0
00:43:40.239 --> 00:43:42.659
So one is 1 is X21 is X one.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8254-0
00:43:42.669 --> 00:43:44.599
That's what we are doing right
negating of that.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8264-0
00:43:44.099 --> 00:43:46.549
Yeah, this is this is Xman Baba,
this is X2.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8259-0
00:43:46.999 --> 00:43:47.409
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8262-0
00:43:47.419 --> 00:43:47.829
Got it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8273-0
00:43:47.839 --> 00:43:48.749
Yes, yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8277-0
00:43:48.759 --> 00:43:49.199
This will.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8287-0
00:43:49.109 --> 00:43:50.119
That's what I wrote here now.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8279-0
00:43:49.209 --> 00:43:50.849
Yeah, OK yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8300-0
00:43:50.859 --> 00:43:54.531
So Lambda times is nothing but
whatever the, so it can be any

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8300-1
00:43:54.531 --> 00:43:55.479
any multiple of.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8302-0
00:43:56.359 --> 00:43:56.869
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8314-0
00:43:57.279 --> 00:43:58.869
So my point is this is it?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8312-0
00:43:57.509 --> 00:43:57.729
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8324-0
00:43:59.059 --> 00:44:01.269
Now you know what belongs to the
null space.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8336-0
00:44:01.279 --> 00:44:03.859
Null space is generated by
something called 1 -, 1.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8353-0
00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:09.379
Right now you take a transpose A
what is a transpose?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8359-0
00:44:09.389 --> 00:44:14.679
A1122 times 1122 correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8367-0
00:44:18.419 --> 00:44:18.569
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8372-0
00:44:18.799 --> 00:44:19.229
It's gonna.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8375-0
00:44:19.739 --> 00:44:19.989
And if.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8377-0
00:44:20.629 --> 00:44:21.699
This is nothing but five.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8381-0
00:44:23.009 --> 00:44:23.709
What is other one?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8387-0
00:44:27.379 --> 00:44:29.159
By what is this one?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8391-0
00:44:30.929 --> 00:44:31.319
Right.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8395-0
00:44:32.019 --> 00:44:32.679
What is this one?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8399-0
00:44:35.149 --> 00:44:35.569
5.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8400-0
00:44:35.269 --> 00:44:35.739
Right, correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8402-0
00:44:39.429 --> 00:44:39.749
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8426-0
00:44:41.859 --> 00:44:44.789
There is matrix multiplication
becoming difficult for you.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8445-0
00:44:43.199 --> 00:44:43.389
What?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8431-0
00:44:45.399 --> 00:44:46.129
No, no, no.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8442-0
00:44:46.079 --> 00:44:46.739
No, Sir, no Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8443-0
00:44:46.199 --> 00:44:47.629
Where this is fine.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8439-0
00:44:47.479 --> 00:44:48.069
It's fun.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8453-0
00:44:47.639 --> 00:44:48.919
This is fine, yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8451-0
00:44:48.079 --> 00:44:48.619
Fair for being.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8454-0
00:44:49.769 --> 00:44:50.569
So now to find.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8455-0
00:44:49.919 --> 00:44:50.399
Certainly.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8469-0
00:44:52.409 --> 00:44:54.359
Like you said here I want to ask
you one question.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8473-0
00:44:53.279 --> 00:44:53.459
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8489-0
00:44:54.369 --> 00:44:59.192
So you write a transpose of a,
so the a value is 1 one and two

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8489-1
00:44:59.192 --> 00:44:59.499
two.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8508-0
00:45:00.239 --> 00:45:04.309
So like it is heavily is 1 one
and two two.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8495-0
00:45:00.699 --> 00:45:00.859
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8529-0
00:45:04.319 --> 00:45:09.405
Then it should be 1212 so so you
are just writing it from the

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8529-1
00:45:09.405 --> 00:45:12.359
very beginning inverse only,
right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8542-0
00:45:16.139 --> 00:45:16.299
No.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8545-0
00:45:16.449 --> 00:45:17.859
Nothing was transferred.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8558-0
00:45:16.689 --> 00:45:19.009
Transpose, transpose, transpose.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8556-0
00:45:17.129 --> 00:45:17.679
What's 200?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8569-0
00:45:18.189 --> 00:45:20.689
Transport means converting row
to column.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8560-0
00:45:19.189 --> 00:45:19.499
What?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8562-0
00:45:20.769 --> 00:45:20.929
No.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8577-0
00:45:21.529 --> 00:45:21.709
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8578-0
00:45:21.709 --> 00:45:23.239
Yeah, yeah, the, the that I
know.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8580-0
00:45:22.279 --> 00:45:23.419
Rows and columns are changed.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8605-0
00:45:23.249 --> 00:45:26.981
Like, yeah, so you are writing
the the inverse first, and then

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8605-1
00:45:26.981 --> 00:45:28.759
you're writing the actual one.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8609-0
00:45:29.019 --> 00:45:30.389
There is no inverse Baba.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8617-0
00:45:30.979 --> 00:45:32.339
I have written a transpose.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8621-0
00:45:32.869 --> 00:45:34.289
Like, that's a transpose.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8639-0
00:45:34.299 --> 00:45:38.787
Sorry, like you are writing the
A transpose first and then the

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8640-0
00:45:38.459 --> 00:45:38.639
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8639-1
00:45:38.787 --> 00:45:39.429
actual A.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8660-0
00:45:43.439 --> 00:45:45.699
Now 5555, what is in the null
space?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8662-0
00:45:45.999 --> 00:45:46.449
In the notes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8674-0
00:45:46.619 --> 00:45:49.749
Dual space of a transpose A.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8698-0
00:45:50.359 --> 00:45:56.894
This is all vectors such that
5555 times Y one by two equal to

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8698-1
00:45:56.894 --> 00:45:58.139
00, correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8700-0
00:46:01.809 --> 00:46:01.989
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8713-0
00:46:04.599 --> 00:46:05.169
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8741-0
00:46:04.769 --> 00:46:09.053
So if you solve this again, you
will get a 5 by 1 + 5 by 2 equal

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8753-0
00:46:06.879 --> 00:46:07.029
You.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8741-1
00:46:09.053 --> 00:46:12.679
to zero, which would imply by 1
equal to minus by two.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8743-0
00:46:12.689 --> 00:46:12.929
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8750-0
00:46:13.399 --> 00:46:13.679
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8763-0
00:46:14.389 --> 00:46:17.809
So this will also be generated
by something like 1 -, 1,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8763-1
00:46:17.809 --> 00:46:18.289
correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8767-0
00:46:18.889 --> 00:46:19.159
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8790-0
00:46:19.889 --> 00:46:23.069
So whenever something belongs to
the null space of a transpose A,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8790-1
00:46:23.069 --> 00:46:24.949
it will belong to the null space
of a.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8793-0
00:46:24.959 --> 00:46:25.439
Also correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8798-0
00:46:27.049 --> 00:46:27.299
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8800-0
00:46:28.189 --> 00:46:28.949
That's what I'm claiming.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8809-0
00:46:30.039 --> 00:46:32.429
Are you in a small proof of that
ticket?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8823-0
00:46:32.559 --> 00:46:35.339
So this is also one part which I
will require.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8831-0
00:46:37.019 --> 00:46:39.439
Now I will go here.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8836-0
00:46:39.819 --> 00:46:41.519
He said just go to Notepad.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8842-0
00:46:41.529 --> 00:46:43.009
The last line last line.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8844-0
00:46:43.629 --> 00:46:43.809
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8845-0
00:46:44.469 --> 00:46:44.809
Thank you.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8856-0
00:46:52.009 --> 00:46:53.829
By by 1 + 5 by 2.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8913-0
00:46:59.029 --> 00:47:03.518
So here we prove that the if the
null space of A is 1, -, 1 and a

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8913-1
00:47:03.518 --> 00:47:06.919
transpose, a null space is also
same is equal to.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8914-0
00:47:04.259 --> 00:47:07.366
Now the space of yay is not
space of yay is generate

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8914-1
00:47:07.366 --> 00:47:08.539
generated by 1 -, 1.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8916-0
00:47:11.359 --> 00:47:11.619
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8935-0
00:47:15.189 --> 00:47:19.492
And null space for A transpose
is also can be generated using 1

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8935-1
00:47:19.492 --> 00:47:19.829
-, 1.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8936-0
00:47:20.149 --> 00:47:20.599
Exactly.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8938-0
00:47:27.569 --> 00:47:27.889
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8942-0
00:47:31.379 --> 00:47:31.559
Yep.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8944-0
00:47:32.709 --> 00:47:33.899
Yeah, let's proceed.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8956-0
00:47:38.749 --> 00:47:42.929
So what characterizes this is
and we have.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8955-0
00:47:40.249 --> 00:47:40.459
And.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/8971-0
00:47:46.249 --> 00:47:48.879
And can I symmetric positive
definite matrix have?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9007-0
00:47:48.889 --> 00:47:52.421
Because the full rank in the
last class, we saw that X

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9007-1
00:47:52.421 --> 00:47:56.531
transpose X is always more than
zero and X transpose X equal to

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9007-2
00:47:56.531 --> 00:47:58.779
zero will imply that X = 0,
right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9039-0
00:47:58.069 --> 00:47:58.279
The.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9014-0
00:48:02.309 --> 00:48:02.409
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9019-0
00:48:02.599 --> 00:48:03.199
He said.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9024-0
00:48:03.289 --> 00:48:03.669
Agreed.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9017-0
00:48:04.359 --> 00:48:04.909
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9049-0
00:48:04.919 --> 00:48:08.087
So you X equal to 0 is the only
vector in the null space AX

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9049-1
00:48:08.087 --> 00:48:10.199
equal to 0 is the only element
allowed.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9051-0
00:48:11.479 --> 00:48:12.089
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9067-0
00:48:12.179 --> 00:48:16.359
So then it is having only X
equal to 0.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9088-0
00:48:16.449 --> 00:48:21.629
The null space has dimension 0,
so by the regularity theorem you

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9088-1
00:48:21.629 --> 00:48:24.179
should have full rank agree now.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9090-0
00:48:24.309 --> 00:48:24.809
He said.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9104-0
00:48:26.169 --> 00:48:29.719
For the diagonal matrix, you can
take a particular AI.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9120-0
00:48:30.609 --> 00:48:33.479
This is also I explained last
time, maybe for your benefit.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9140-0
00:48:32.959 --> 00:48:37.929
I don't.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9143-0
00:48:33.489 --> 00:48:37.374
I will do it, but you you are
given a positive definite matrix

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9143-1
00:48:37.374 --> 00:48:39.779
and you are trying to
characterize it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9155-0
00:48:40.179 --> 00:48:43.359
So yeah, it is positive
definite.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9172-0
00:48:43.729 --> 00:48:48.084
Therefore, extrasport AX will be
more than 0 for all X which are

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9172-1
00:48:48.084 --> 00:48:49.559
not equal to 0. Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9178-0
00:48:52.469 --> 00:48:52.849
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9185-0
00:48:53.419 --> 00:48:53.599
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9186-0
00:48:53.639 --> 00:48:53.809
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9204-0
00:48:53.829 --> 00:48:58.582
Now I take for example, suppose
A is a three by three matrix or

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9204-1
00:48:58.582 --> 00:48:59.919
two by two matrix.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9228-0
00:49:00.049 --> 00:49:08.749
So it has a 11A12A21A22 and I
take a vector which is 10.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9239-0
00:49:08.799 --> 00:49:12.079
I will take the same vector in
the transpose here, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9241-0
00:49:16.449 --> 00:49:16.749
Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9253-0
00:49:19.689 --> 00:49:19.789
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9259-0
00:49:20.189 --> 00:49:20.539
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9262-0
00:49:20.509 --> 00:49:20.769
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9260-0
00:49:20.519 --> 00:49:21.969
That is what is EX transpose X.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9282-0
00:49:21.979 --> 00:49:24.929
I've just done X transpose, XA,
yes, yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9278-0
00:49:22.809 --> 00:49:23.759
Umm. Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9275-0
00:49:23.439 --> 00:49:24.049
Yes, yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9313-0
00:49:25.409 --> 00:49:30.094
If I do that, what I will get is
nothing but one zero and then

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9313-1
00:49:30.094 --> 00:49:33.739
here I will get the A11 and then
I'll get a two.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9316-0
00:49:33.749 --> 00:49:34.209
What correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9325-0
00:49:35.679 --> 00:49:35.839
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9335-0
00:49:36.499 --> 00:49:36.779
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9356-0
00:49:36.949 --> 00:49:39.879
Which is nothing but a one, but
which is more than zero, because

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9346-0
00:49:38.279 --> 00:49:38.759
Even when.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9356-1
00:49:39.879 --> 00:49:42.538
if I take any vector, this
quantity should be more than 0,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9356-2
00:49:42.538 --> 00:49:42.809
right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9362-0
00:49:45.339 --> 00:49:45.469
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9368-0
00:49:46.559 --> 00:49:48.249
So this element is positive.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9399-0
00:49:48.579 --> 00:49:53.736
If I take for example 01 of the
same matrix times 01, I will get

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9406-0
00:49:50.919 --> 00:49:51.219
Good.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9399-1
00:49:53.736 --> 00:49:57.069
something for A22 which is also
positive.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9422-0
00:49:57.459 --> 00:50:00.813
So one characterization is you
cannot have something negative

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9422-1
00:50:00.813 --> 00:50:04.114
here, so you should have always
something for positive here.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9417-0
00:50:01.299 --> 00:50:01.499
That's.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9422-2
00:50:04.114 --> 00:50:04.439
Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9423-0
00:50:06.119 --> 00:50:06.269
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9438-0
00:50:08.249 --> 00:50:10.489
OK, this is also one
characterization.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9458-0
00:50:12.029 --> 00:50:16.166
Now inner products and norms are
closely related and where any

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9446-0
00:50:12.429 --> 00:50:12.619
Right.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9458-1
00:50:16.166 --> 00:50:18.399
inner product will induce a
norm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9488-0
00:50:18.869 --> 00:50:22.334
So if I give an inner product,
you take square root of uh, the

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9488-1
00:50:22.334 --> 00:50:24.809
inner part of X&amp;X, it will
be norm of X.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9501-0
00:50:25.829 --> 00:50:29.449
But not every now is induced by
an inner product.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9510-0
00:50:29.699 --> 00:50:33.489
For example, the the man had a
knob.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9558-0
00:50:33.559 --> 00:50:38.275
You can never get the man had a
knob from any inner product, and

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9558-1
00:50:38.275 --> 00:50:42.702
the general theory is if you
have X&amp;Y, the inner part of

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9558-2
00:50:42.702 --> 00:50:47.346
X&amp;Y will always be less than
equal to norm of exchange norm

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9558-3
00:50:47.346 --> 00:50:47.709
of Y.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9570-0
00:50:48.119 --> 00:50:50.869
Now we can prove it in the
generic sensor.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9596-0
00:50:52.079 --> 00:50:55.701
I will not get into the the the
depth of the proof, but I will

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9596-1
00:50:55.701 --> 00:50:57.829
tell you what the crux is all
about.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9630-0
00:50:58.359 --> 00:51:02.371
If you have you and me as two
vectors, you will find that you

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9630-1
00:51:02.371 --> 00:51:06.512
minus alpha V for any alpha as a
constant you will have U minus

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9630-2
00:51:06.512 --> 00:51:08.389
alpha V also selector agreed.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9637-0
00:51:11.419 --> 00:51:11.939
You should.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9638-0
00:51:11.729 --> 00:51:12.109
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9647-0
00:51:13.099 --> 00:51:15.319
Now you minus Alpha V norm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9651-0
00:51:15.329 --> 00:51:16.199
The whole square.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9659-0
00:51:16.209 --> 00:51:18.259
This is a quantity which is more
than 0 correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9666-0
00:51:20.389 --> 00:51:20.489
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9674-0
00:51:21.669 --> 00:51:21.799
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9703-0
00:51:21.819 --> 00:51:25.104
Now this is nothing but the
inner product of you minus alpha

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9703-1
00:51:25.104 --> 00:51:28.228
beat U minus alpha V which is
nothing but U minus alpha V

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9703-2
00:51:28.228 --> 00:51:29.629
transpose U minus alpha V.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9712-0
00:51:29.639 --> 00:51:32.299
Here we are considering and.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9723-0
00:51:32.489 --> 00:51:34.939
What you minus Alpha V has one
vector.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9745-0
00:51:35.449 --> 00:51:40.619
Now, if you do the transpose of
you minus alpha V you will get a

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9745-1
00:51:40.619 --> 00:51:44.199
U transpose minus alpha V
transpose correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9748-0
00:51:46.419 --> 00:51:46.589
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9764-0
00:51:47.799 --> 00:51:51.868
Times U minus alpha V what you
do is you expand this entire

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9764-1
00:51:51.868 --> 00:51:52.479
quantity.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9798-0
00:51:53.439 --> 00:51:56.935
You find that it you'll get you
transpose you minus alpha U

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9798-1
00:51:56.935 --> 00:52:00.315
transpose V minus alpha V
transpose U plus Alpha Square V

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9798-2
00:52:00.315 --> 00:52:03.229
transpose V this is more than
equal to 0 correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9804-0
00:52:07.419 --> 00:52:07.599
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9811-0
00:52:08.479 --> 00:52:09.019
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9826-0
00:52:09.279 --> 00:52:12.629
Now I have not put any condition
on my alpha so far.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9835-0
00:52:12.639 --> 00:52:15.949
I have taken any general alpha
but alpha can be set.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9841-0
00:52:16.009 --> 00:52:20.609
As you transpose V by V,
transpose V ugly.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9856-0
00:52:24.099 --> 00:52:27.689
And where this B is a nonzero
vector.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9858-0
00:52:28.199 --> 00:52:28.909
If I do that.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9876-0
00:52:31.359 --> 00:52:34.629
I will get something like you
transpose you minus.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9885-0
00:52:34.639 --> 00:52:36.579
You transpose you the whole
what?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9899-0
00:52:34.909 --> 00:52:40.704
How you get said how you get the
alpha U transpose where VNV

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9924-0
00:52:40.569 --> 00:52:45.778
Norma, I am saying when I
started with you, minus Alpha VI

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9899-1
00:52:40.704 --> 00:52:41.559
transfer?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9924-1
00:52:45.778 --> 00:52:49.929
took alpha to be an arbitrary
number, correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9922-0
00:52:47.619 --> 00:52:47.829
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9928-0
00:52:50.819 --> 00:52:51.059
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9974-0
00:52:52.119 --> 00:52:56.990
That means this quantity is
universally true whether you

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9974-1
00:52:56.990 --> 00:53:02.031
take alpha to be one 211 -,
42.75 -, 5, whatever number it

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9980-0
00:53:00.279 --> 00:53:03.869
Any, any anything teaser yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9974-2
00:53:02.031 --> 00:53:04.339
is, it is true, correct do.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9995-0
00:53:04.409 --> 00:53:07.474
Do you agree that when I give
you vectors you and we you

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/9995-1
00:53:07.474 --> 00:53:08.819
transpose me is a number?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10000-0
00:53:12.369 --> 00:53:12.869
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10009-0
00:53:12.879 --> 00:53:13.979
Scalar number.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10003-0
00:53:13.979 --> 00:53:14.209
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10014-0
00:53:14.219 --> 00:53:15.409
That V transpose V.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10032-0
00:53:16.539 --> 00:53:17.519
And so skillet.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10028-0
00:53:16.649 --> 00:53:17.069
Scalar.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10034-0
00:53:17.529 --> 00:53:18.519
That also scalar.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10037-0
00:53:17.709 --> 00:53:19.789
So you transpose me by V
transpose V.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10058-0
00:53:20.849 --> 00:53:21.549
Scalar number.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10063-0
00:53:21.429 --> 00:53:22.689
Stellar is scalar value.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10081-0
00:53:22.149 --> 00:53:26.332
So this alpha is a scalar, so I
take this particular alpha for

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10081-1
00:53:26.332 --> 00:53:28.989
my theorem and then I
substituted here.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10094-0
00:53:29.989 --> 00:53:35.719
If I do that, I will take you
transpose you minus alpha.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10119-0
00:53:35.829 --> 00:53:39.856
So if I do that, it is a U
transpose v * U transpose V by V

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10119-1
00:53:39.856 --> 00:53:41.199
transpose V correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10144-0
00:53:42.259 --> 00:53:46.116
So actually why I actually I'm
not able to understand why alpha

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10144-1
00:53:46.116 --> 00:53:49.069
you are taking in only such a
particular manner.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10176-0
00:53:49.079 --> 00:53:52.719
Because with alpha is N teacher
and then only in the single

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10166-0
00:53:52.279 --> 00:53:52.979
I want to.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10176-1
00:53:52.719 --> 00:53:55.329
format you are taking a
particular format.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10172-0
00:53:56.409 --> 00:53:56.599
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10184-0
00:53:56.609 --> 00:53:58.479
Bubba, I want to prove a result.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10188-0
00:53:58.939 --> 00:53:59.959
This is in.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10200-0
00:54:00.049 --> 00:54:03.109
This is in general true for any
value of alpha, correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10207-0
00:54:04.019 --> 00:54:04.329
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10221-0
00:54:05.159 --> 00:54:07.971
So if I take a particular value,
I'll get a particular result,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10221-1
00:54:07.971 --> 00:54:08.239
right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10235-0
00:54:09.159 --> 00:54:11.499
Yes, particular value then
particular reject, yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10230-0
00:54:12.079 --> 00:54:12.389
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10298-0
00:54:12.399 --> 00:54:15.936
So I can choose any alpha of my
choice, so I am choosing you

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10298-1
00:54:15.936 --> 00:54:19.763
transpose V by V, transpose V as
a particular value of alpha, and

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10298-2
00:54:19.763 --> 00:54:23.532
then I am getting something like
you transpose U * V transpose V

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10298-3
00:54:23.532 --> 00:54:26.779
is more than equal to U
transpose with the whole square

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10298-4
00:54:26.779 --> 00:54:29.679
which is basically the Cauchy
Schwarz inequality.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10308-0
00:54:30.249 --> 00:54:31.949
This is norm of you hold square.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10317-0
00:54:31.959 --> 00:54:33.079
This is norm of you hold square.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10327-0
00:54:33.089 --> 00:54:36.039
This is more than equal to norm
of P1, correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10343-0
00:54:38.409 --> 00:54:40.399
In the product until yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10354-0
00:54:38.909 --> 00:54:44.599
So so by I have said that you
and we are two vectors right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10356-0
00:54:44.109 --> 00:54:44.269
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10365-0
00:54:45.369 --> 00:54:48.149
Then again, Alpha is a scalar
value, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10366-0
00:54:48.699 --> 00:54:48.879
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10385-0
00:54:52.689 --> 00:54:56.059
Then how can we link it with
alpha to vector?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10380-0
00:54:52.779 --> 00:54:53.439
What is the problem?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10392-0
00:54:57.379 --> 00:54:58.719
Sorry, I mean ******** scalar.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10400-0
00:55:00.629 --> 00:55:02.339
Said this small example please.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10416-0
00:55:04.259 --> 00:55:05.069
I'm going to use when.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10421-0
00:55:04.309 --> 00:55:05.029
Suppose let me.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10465-0
00:55:05.079 --> 00:55:09.741
When you say that you and we are
vector, when I'm running that

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10465-1
00:55:09.741 --> 00:55:14.404
particular query but again then
I'm applying alphas scalar and

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10443-0
00:55:13.849 --> 00:55:14.009
No.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10465-2
00:55:14.404 --> 00:55:18.919
how can I say that you know
scalar and multiply with vector?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10462-0
00:55:16.739 --> 00:55:18.199
No, no, no.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10475-0
00:55:19.729 --> 00:55:25.219
So you is minus 13P is 21.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10480-0
00:55:25.609 --> 00:55:26.389
Are these two vectors?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10484-0
00:55:28.389 --> 00:55:28.539
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10489-0
00:55:29.369 --> 00:55:29.849
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10490-0
00:55:30.309 --> 00:55:31.589
Let alpha be a scalar.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10501-0
00:55:34.819 --> 00:55:37.149
Now what is U transpose you?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10513-0
00:55:37.339 --> 00:55:41.359
This is nothing but minus one 3
-, 1, three.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10535-0
00:55:41.369 --> 00:55:45.578
This is nothing but minus one
whole squared plus 3 squared is

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10535-1
00:55:45.578 --> 00:55:46.869
equal to 10. Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10540-0
00:55:50.099 --> 00:55:50.479
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10546-0
00:55:52.019 --> 00:55:54.759
So what is now?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10549-0
00:55:54.769 --> 00:55:55.759
We hold square.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10567-0
00:55:55.809 --> 00:55:59.219
This is nothing but we transpose
we, which is nothing but two.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10576-0
00:55:59.229 --> 00:56:01.899
One no one.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10588-0
00:56:01.989 --> 00:56:05.069
This is nothing but 4 + 1 which
is equal to 5. Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10594-0
00:56:07.549 --> 00:56:08.039
Yeah. So.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10636-0
00:56:09.589 --> 00:56:15.137
Now I can consider for this
alpha Q minus alpha V which is

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10636-1
00:56:15.137 --> 00:56:20.874
nothing but minus 1/3 minus
alpha times 21, which is nothing

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10636-2
00:56:20.874 --> 00:56:26.329
but minus 1 -, 2 alpha 3 minus
A1, he said, not a vector.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10643-0
00:56:30.439 --> 00:56:31.219
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10645-0
00:56:31.679 --> 00:56:32.159
It is.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10648-0
00:56:31.679 --> 00:56:33.139
OK, got it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10653-0
00:56:34.349 --> 00:56:34.789
Agreed.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10666-0
00:56:35.949 --> 00:56:39.539
Now what I'm saying is you minus
Alpha V.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10664-0
00:56:36.409 --> 00:56:36.929
Yes, so.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10693-0
00:56:42.389 --> 00:56:48.059
BIDIT you minus alpha V If I do
this transpose you minus alpha

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10693-1
00:56:48.059 --> 00:56:50.219
V, what do you get this?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10699-0
00:56:50.229 --> 00:56:52.069
You'll get minus 1 -, 2, alpha.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10716-0
00:56:54.209 --> 00:56:59.351
Comma 3 minus alpha times minus
1 -, 2 alpha 3 minus alpha

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10716-1
00:56:59.351 --> 00:57:00.049
correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10718-0
00:57:01.999 --> 00:57:02.159
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10720-0
00:57:04.359 --> 00:57:04.639
Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10727-0
00:57:07.409 --> 00:57:07.819
He is.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10756-0
00:57:09.319 --> 00:57:13.521
So this is nothing but minus 1
-, 2, alpha, the whole square

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10756-1
00:57:13.521 --> 00:57:16.139
plus 3 minus alpha, the whole
square.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10763-0
00:57:16.909 --> 00:57:17.939
Which is always positive.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10771-0
00:57:19.079 --> 00:57:21.279
Yeah, that, this, this is going
to be always positive, correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10774-0
00:57:25.549 --> 00:57:25.959
You agree?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10785-0
00:57:28.929 --> 00:57:29.069
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10788-0
00:57:29.169 --> 00:57:29.589
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10783-0
00:57:30.209 --> 00:57:30.429
Right.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10804-0
00:57:30.439 --> 00:57:33.046
Because it's a square of two
quantities, not can the square

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10808-0
00:57:32.699 --> 00:57:32.979
Right.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10804-1
00:57:33.046 --> 00:57:34.089
of a number be negative?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10829-0
00:57:34.099 --> 00:57:36.509
No, it cannot be negative, so it
is always more than equal to 0.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10826-0
00:57:34.759 --> 00:57:35.019
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10835-0
00:57:34.849 --> 00:57:37.089
No, it can't. Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10853-0
00:57:36.799 --> 00:57:40.082
Now we said dependent upon any
particular value of alpha or it

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10853-1
00:57:40.082 --> 00:57:41.229
is true for any alpha.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10867-0
00:57:42.739 --> 00:57:43.279
Any of you?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10869-0
00:57:42.769 --> 00:57:43.629
So for any alpha.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10870-0
00:57:43.659 --> 00:57:44.689
It's true for any alpha.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10889-0
00:57:45.339 --> 00:57:50.884
So can you not take my alpha to
be nothing but you transpose V

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10889-1
00:57:50.884 --> 00:57:52.469
by V, transpose V?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10899-0
00:57:53.019 --> 00:57:56.229
What is you transpose V you take
you transpose V?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10905-0
00:57:56.239 --> 00:57:58.989
Yes, minus 1/3.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10912-0
00:58:04.069 --> 00:58:05.759
You transpose times B.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10917-0
00:58:05.809 --> 00:58:07.449
What is B21?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10928-0
00:58:10.929 --> 00:58:14.159
By me transpose V2121.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10942-0
00:58:14.709 --> 00:58:19.519
Now, what is this minus 2 + 3 by
4 + 1?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10952-0
00:58:19.619 --> 00:58:21.139
This is equal to 1 by 5.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10956-0
00:58:21.339 --> 00:58:22.099
Is it not a scalar?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10965-0
00:58:24.059 --> 00:58:24.259
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10975-0
00:58:25.269 --> 00:58:25.669
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10966-0
00:58:25.659 --> 00:58:26.189
I can't.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10986-0
00:58:26.199 --> 00:58:28.649
I can workout with the scalar
called 1 by 5.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10992-0
00:58:28.659 --> 00:58:29.889
Also in this theorem, no.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/10998-0
00:58:29.899 --> 00:58:31.309
This is true for any value of
alpha.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11016-0
00:58:33.459 --> 00:58:33.779
Yes, yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11018-0
00:58:33.549 --> 00:58:33.889
Right.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11020-0
00:58:34.099 --> 00:58:34.309
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11028-0
00:58:34.839 --> 00:58:37.439
So you're working out for one by
five, it'll be true, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11036-0
00:58:39.159 --> 00:58:39.359
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11039-0
00:58:39.519 --> 00:58:39.629
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11046-0
00:58:39.809 --> 00:58:40.389
Yes, so.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11047-0
00:58:40.149 --> 00:58:40.669
He said.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11054-0
00:58:40.909 --> 00:58:43.039
And the theorem is true for any
value of alpha.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11068-0
00:58:43.049 --> 00:58:45.659
If I put alpha equal to 1 by 4,
it will be naturally true.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11079-0
00:58:45.829 --> 00:58:46.959
That's what I am doing here.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11098-0
00:58:48.039 --> 00:58:52.699
So this new transpose V by V
transpose V this is this, Kayla,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11098-1
00:58:52.699 --> 00:58:54.729
you should understand that.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11100-0
00:58:57.619 --> 00:58:57.899
Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11114-0
00:59:01.019 --> 00:59:01.459
Yes, so.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11116-0
00:59:01.919 --> 00:59:02.579
Yeah, it is.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11147-0
00:59:02.479 --> 00:59:06.084
Like it you get U transpose you
V transpose V is more is more

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11147-1
00:59:06.084 --> 00:59:09.747
than equal to you transpose with
the whole square which is the

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11147-2
00:59:09.747 --> 00:59:11.259
Cauchy Schwarz inequality.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11150-0
00:59:11.269 --> 00:59:12.319
It is written here. Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11156-0
00:59:15.339 --> 00:59:15.809
See you soon.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11171-0
00:59:16.999 --> 00:59:20.419
OK, right now there is something
called as a metric space.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11208-0
00:59:20.429 --> 00:59:24.562
Actually I want to finish entire
thing in half an hour, but we

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11208-1
00:59:24.562 --> 00:59:28.828
are now cross ohh more than one
hour and I am not even done with

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11208-2
00:59:28.828 --> 00:59:30.009
50% of the slides.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11217-0
00:59:30.379 --> 00:59:32.469
So there is some concept of
distance.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11222-0
00:59:32.479 --> 00:59:35.439
So the distance also will have
some properties.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11228-0
00:59:37.459 --> 00:59:37.929
What is it?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11236-0
00:59:38.099 --> 00:59:38.739
Are the properties.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11246-0
00:59:40.359 --> 00:59:43.679
There are three main properties,
the distance between 2 vectors.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11259-0
00:59:44.839 --> 00:59:47.309
Do you agree that it should be
more than or equal to 0?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11263-0
00:59:49.889 --> 00:59:50.109
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11265-0
00:59:50.169 --> 00:59:50.389
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11284-0
00:59:52.149 --> 00:59:54.928
And distance between X&amp;Y
should be the same as distance

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11284-1
00:59:54.928 --> 00:59:55.669
between Y&amp;X.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11285-0
00:59:56.719 --> 00:59:56.839
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11286-0
00:59:56.859 --> 00:59:57.069
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11321-0
00:59:59.199 --> 01:00:03.723
And there is always something
called triangle inequality which

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11321-1
01:00:03.723 --> 01:00:08.103
says the distance between A and
C will be less than distance

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11321-2
01:00:08.103 --> 01:00:10.689
between A and B&amp;B and C,
right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11329-0
01:00:15.099 --> 01:00:15.229
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11332-0
01:00:15.429 --> 01:00:15.729
Thanks.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11336-0
01:00:16.599 --> 01:00:17.189
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11340-0
01:00:16.599 --> 01:00:17.149
He is.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11347-0
01:00:17.599 --> 01:00:21.299
So those are the three
properties I have listed here.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11379-0
01:00:23.379 --> 01:00:26.622
The distance is always more than
equal to 0, the distance equal

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11379-1
01:00:26.622 --> 01:00:29.866
to 0 between two points implies
that one point is on top of the

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11379-2
01:00:29.866 --> 01:00:30.829
other point, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11383-0
01:00:30.839 --> 01:00:31.649
That is equal to Y.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11392-0
01:00:38.559 --> 01:00:39.029
It's a.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11394-0
01:00:38.879 --> 01:00:39.099
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11444-0
01:00:40.139 --> 01:00:43.476
These symmetric, which means the
distance between X&amp;Y and the

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11444-1
01:00:43.476 --> 01:00:46.510
distance between Y&amp;X are
exactly the same and the third

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11444-2
01:00:46.510 --> 01:00:49.544
one is the triangle inequality
which says that the distance

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11444-3
01:00:49.544 --> 01:00:52.477
between X&amp;Z will always be
less than distance between

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11444-4
01:00:52.477 --> 01:00:54.399
X&amp;Y and distance between
Y&amp;Z.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11475-0
01:00:54.869 --> 01:00:58.652
So whenever these three
properties are satisfied, we

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11475-1
01:00:58.652 --> 01:01:03.292
call it as a metric and and the
space endowed with the metric is

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11475-2
01:01:03.292 --> 01:01:05.149
called a metric space. OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11480-0
01:01:07.739 --> 01:01:08.119
He is.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11481-0
01:01:09.009 --> 01:01:10.089
OK, bye.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11495-0
01:01:12.439 --> 01:01:14.559
Now there is something on hand,
yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11502-0
01:01:14.519 --> 01:01:16.819
The triangle inequality.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11497-0
01:01:15.129 --> 01:01:15.309
Ah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11507-0
01:01:17.259 --> 01:01:17.419
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11531-0
01:01:17.779 --> 01:01:21.725
That's true for the any of the
triangle, so length of the two

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11531-1
01:01:21.725 --> 01:01:24.399
sides is always less than the
third side.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11539-0
01:01:24.729 --> 01:01:26.129
He's always more than the 3rd
state.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11540-0
01:01:26.299 --> 01:01:27.819
Sorry, more than the third size,
yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11554-0
01:01:30.219 --> 01:01:32.419
OK, the same thing we are using
same concept.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11555-0
01:01:32.689 --> 01:01:33.619
Same concept there.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11557-0
01:01:35.919 --> 01:01:36.139
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11564-0
01:01:38.989 --> 01:01:39.989
You did an example there.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11567-0
01:01:44.649 --> 01:01:44.929
No.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11572-0
01:01:46.059 --> 01:01:47.109
OK, fine.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11590-0
01:01:47.979 --> 01:01:52.388
Now there is something called
the the the angles and not

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11590-1
01:01:52.388 --> 01:01:54.709
orthogonality between vectors.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11605-0
01:01:55.269 --> 01:01:58.818
We want to see whether one
vector is orthogonal to the

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11605-1
01:01:58.818 --> 01:02:00.109
other vector or not.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11622-0
01:02:00.639 --> 01:02:04.616
Now the Cauchy Schwarz
inequality simply says that this

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11622-1
01:02:04.616 --> 01:02:05.469
transpose Y.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11653-0
01:02:05.479 --> 01:02:09.940
If you divide by norm of X and
norm of Y, this is a quantity in

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11653-1
01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:12.729
absolute value which is bounded
by one.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11657-0
01:02:12.779 --> 01:02:15.069
So it typically lies between
minus one and one.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11691-0
01:02:17.359 --> 01:02:21.831
Now this is very important that
uh, when a quantity lies between

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11691-1
01:02:21.831 --> 01:02:26.234
minus one on one, we can either
associate sign angle to them or

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11691-2
01:02:26.234 --> 01:02:27.679
cosine angle to them.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11706-0
01:02:27.689 --> 01:02:30.078
Because sin and cosine lie
between minus one and one, I

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11706-1
01:02:30.078 --> 01:02:30.889
hope you know that.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11709-0
01:02:32.369 --> 01:02:32.569
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11713-0
01:02:34.079 --> 01:02:34.259
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11730-0
01:02:34.269 --> 01:02:38.715
So what we generally do is you
are given any two vectors

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11730-1
01:02:38.715 --> 01:02:39.339
X&amp;Y.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11766-0
01:02:39.709 --> 01:02:43.211
You are going to take X,
transpose, YY norm of X and norm

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11766-1
01:02:43.211 --> 01:02:47.016
of Y, and this you're going to
equate it to the cosine of some

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11766-2
01:02:47.016 --> 01:02:47.379
angle.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11797-0
01:02:47.689 --> 01:02:51.696
Now if you equate to the cosine
of some angle, you'll get an

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11797-1
01:02:51.696 --> 01:02:55.639
angry that angle will be the
angle between the two vectors.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11801-0
01:02:55.689 --> 01:02:56.279
X&amp;Y.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11803-0
01:02:56.329 --> 01:02:56.739
Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11822-0
01:02:57.309 --> 01:03:01.480
Now if you get angles, if you
get this extra aspose, why to be

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11812-0
01:02:58.329 --> 01:02:58.449
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11822-1
01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:02.209
equal to 0?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11829-0
01:03:04.189 --> 01:03:04.859
What do you conclude?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11841-0
01:03:08.329 --> 01:03:09.329
They're orthogonal letters.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11842-0
01:03:08.339 --> 01:03:09.379
Cause of which angle is 0.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11853-0
01:03:11.189 --> 01:03:11.509
0.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11868-0
01:03:11.549 --> 01:03:13.429
There this.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11860-0
01:03:11.579 --> 01:03:12.239
O'Donnell.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11864-0
01:03:13.119 --> 01:03:13.279
What?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11871-0
01:03:13.319 --> 01:03:14.539
The coding instead.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11883-0
01:03:15.869 --> 01:03:16.999
I would miss 9.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11876-0
01:03:15.929 --> 01:03:16.249
90.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11894-0
01:03:17.249 --> 01:03:19.669
90 that means X&amp;Y are
perpendicular.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11891-0
01:03:17.449 --> 01:03:17.779
Yep.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11890-0
01:03:18.039 --> 01:03:18.959
Cost 90 zero.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11902-0
01:03:21.119 --> 01:03:21.399
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11923-0
01:03:22.179 --> 01:03:25.889
No, but how will we know when to
take cosine and when to take

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11906-0
01:03:22.319 --> 01:03:22.579
Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11923-1
01:03:25.889 --> 01:03:26.189
sign?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11920-0
01:03:26.429 --> 01:03:27.539
No, no, we don't take.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11948-0
01:03:27.709 --> 01:03:31.080
I am just saying since it lies
between minus one one, it is

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11948-1
01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:34.059
typical that you know you are
saying sign or cosine.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11964-0
01:03:34.109 --> 01:03:38.039
In this case, we just, we just
take a cosine of the angle.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11959-0
01:03:34.679 --> 01:03:35.519
A teacher, OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11968-0
01:03:40.609 --> 01:03:40.849
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/11969-0
01:03:41.559 --> 01:03:41.949
Got it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12010-0
01:03:45.029 --> 01:03:49.805
But so this is the cosine of the
angle when it is when the dot

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12010-1
01:03:49.805 --> 01:03:54.505
part is close to zero, then it
means that the the vectors are

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12010-2
01:03:54.505 --> 01:03:57.689
more or less perpendicular to
each other.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12013-0
01:03:56.189 --> 01:03:56.409
Good.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12035-0
01:03:57.699 --> 01:04:00.927
That's what because you get
Omega, which is by two, which

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12035-1
01:04:00.927 --> 01:04:03.599
means they are perpendicular to
each other. OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12061-0
01:04:06.679 --> 01:04:09.758
How did you, by definition, you
say X is perpendicular to Y and

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12061-1
01:04:09.758 --> 01:04:11.009
this is how it is written.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12088-0
01:04:11.419 --> 01:04:15.390
You know that a 0 vector is
perpendicular to to every

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12088-1
01:04:15.390 --> 01:04:19.655
vector, because you take the
inner product of X and zero,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12088-2
01:04:19.655 --> 01:04:20.979
you'll get a zero.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12090-0
01:04:21.979 --> 01:04:22.339
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12097-0
01:04:22.949 --> 01:04:24.879
And you want an example here.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12114-0
01:04:29.609 --> 01:04:30.169
Yes, Sir. Please.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12125-0
01:04:29.749 --> 01:04:30.419
Yes, office.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12127-0
01:04:29.989 --> 01:04:30.589
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12129-0
01:04:30.259 --> 01:04:30.989
That's happening.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12118-0
01:04:30.929 --> 01:04:31.679
OK, you take.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12123-0
01:04:31.769 --> 01:04:32.079
An X.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12141-0
01:04:32.259 --> 01:04:35.309
IS11 transpose and Y equal to
minus one transpose.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12153-0
01:04:35.789 --> 01:04:39.359
You can calculate XY what is XY
the dot product.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12174-0
01:04:39.909 --> 01:04:43.089
It is X transpose Y which is
nothing but one into minus 1 + 1

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12174-1
01:04:43.089 --> 01:04:44.629
into one, which is 0, correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12176-0
01:04:46.809 --> 01:04:47.159
Thank.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12185-0
01:04:48.639 --> 01:04:48.949
Angry.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12213-0
01:04:50.059 --> 01:04:54.026
So with respect to one of the
the inner products, the inner

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12213-1
01:04:54.026 --> 01:04:58.126
product here is basically that,
yeah, I have taken A to be an

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12213-2
01:04:58.126 --> 01:04:59.779
identity matrix, correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12234-0
01:05:03.179 --> 01:05:05.973
When I take a dot product, it
means I have taken the identity

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12228-0
01:05:03.579 --> 01:05:03.719
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12234-1
01:05:05.973 --> 01:05:06.289
matrix.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12264-0
01:05:06.299 --> 01:05:09.805
So if X equal to 1, one
transpose and Y equal to minus

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12264-1
01:05:09.805 --> 01:05:13.821
one, one transpose your big X
transpose here which is equal to

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12264-2
01:05:13.821 --> 01:05:13.949
0.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12308-0
01:05:13.959 --> 01:05:17.910
And what did we conclude in the
last the last slide when next

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12308-1
01:05:17.910 --> 01:05:21.989
transpose very easy equal to 0X
and Y are perpendicular, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12304-0
01:05:18.979 --> 01:05:20.099
Product with the identity.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12303-0
01:05:19.309 --> 01:05:20.139
They are perpendicular.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12310-0
01:05:21.359 --> 01:05:22.799
Yeah, yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12312-0
01:05:22.869 --> 01:05:23.109
Right.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12369-0
01:05:23.339 --> 01:05:23.549
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12324-0
01:05:24.199 --> 01:05:27.049
That perpendicularity is only
with respect to the DOT product.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12340-0
01:05:27.059 --> 01:05:29.943
Don't think that it is
perpendicular with respect to

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12340-1
01:05:29.943 --> 01:05:31.249
any other inner product.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12366-0
01:05:31.299 --> 01:05:36.025
Suppose I take the air is
symmetric positive definite

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12366-1
01:05:36.025 --> 01:05:39.789
matrix to be 2001, so he's 2001
symmetric.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12377-0
01:05:41.979 --> 01:05:42.159
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12380-0
01:05:42.689 --> 01:05:42.839
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12382-0
01:05:42.869 --> 01:05:43.849
Is it positive definite?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12385-0
01:05:44.789 --> 01:05:44.999
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12404-0
01:05:45.779 --> 01:05:50.572
OK, so if I take extra umm spose
AY this is the inner product

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12404-1
01:05:50.572 --> 01:05:51.809
between X&amp;Y.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12410-0
01:05:52.379 --> 01:05:54.029
The angle is basically XY.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12415-0
01:05:54.039 --> 01:05:55.189
Should I calculate XY?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12420-0
01:05:57.319 --> 01:05:57.999
They in the product.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12429-0
01:06:00.769 --> 01:06:01.469
Yes, Sir. Please.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12438-0
01:06:02.589 --> 01:06:04.699
So here A is 2001, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12436-0
01:06:02.749 --> 01:06:03.279
Please please.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12439-0
01:06:04.949 --> 01:06:05.399
Exactly.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12456-0
01:06:13.299 --> 01:06:17.239
So here you equal to 2001 and
what is your ex?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12466-0
01:06:24.679 --> 01:06:28.339
X IS11 and minus 111.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12475-0
01:06:30.259 --> 01:06:32.259
And why is minus one one
correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12491-0
01:06:34.639 --> 01:06:39.569
Now, what is the inner product
of X&amp;Y with respect to a?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12503-0
01:06:39.619 --> 01:06:41.729
This is nothing but X transpose.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12523-0
01:06:41.739 --> 01:06:48.986
AY, this is nothing but X
transpose IS11 and then 2001 and

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12523-1
01:06:48.986 --> 01:06:50.829
Y is minus one.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12525-0
01:06:50.839 --> 01:06:51.269
One correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12532-0
01:06:53.679 --> 01:06:53.799
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12538-0
01:06:54.549 --> 01:06:54.689
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12571-0
01:06:55.279 --> 01:06:59.274
This is nothing but one 1 *, -,
2 and this is a one correct,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12540-0
01:06:55.579 --> 01:06:55.999
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12571-1
01:06:59.274 --> 01:07:03.335
which is nothing but minus 2 + 1
which is equal to minus one,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12571-2
01:07:03.335 --> 01:07:03.859
correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12574-0
01:07:04.799 --> 01:07:04.919
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12581-0
01:07:05.299 --> 01:07:05.819
He said.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12577-0
01:07:06.439 --> 01:07:07.089
OK, So what?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12589-0
01:07:07.099 --> 01:07:10.179
What is norm of X norm of X is
nothing but.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12607-0
01:07:12.569 --> 01:07:13.829
Strong legs.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12611-0
01:07:12.629 --> 01:07:15.568
One square plus one square
square root which is equal to

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12611-1
01:07:15.568 --> 01:07:15.929
sqrt 2.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12626-0
01:07:17.199 --> 01:07:18.159
One part offer.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12617-0
01:07:19.669 --> 01:07:20.469
What is normal boy?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12629-0
01:07:24.119 --> 01:07:25.159
It's got 2.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12630-0
01:07:25.499 --> 01:07:25.809
Same.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12636-0
01:07:25.899 --> 01:07:28.339
Same same route.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12646-0
01:07:29.099 --> 01:07:31.679
Therefore, what do you what do
you want to calculate?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12659-0
01:07:33.769 --> 01:07:34.619
Because I'm very good.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12664-0
01:07:35.569 --> 01:07:36.569
All of X #3.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12667-0
01:07:37.529 --> 01:07:38.219
This is nothing but.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12679-0
01:07:40.799 --> 01:07:41.659
Minus one by two.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12692-0
01:07:42.019 --> 01:07:44.369
And it's probably through to a
group.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12697-0
01:07:44.039 --> 01:07:44.969
Minus one by two.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12693-0
01:07:44.569 --> 01:07:45.879
Minus minus one by two.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12709-0
01:07:46.129 --> 01:07:49.568
So you said this cost of Omega
is equal to minus one by two,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12709-1
01:07:49.568 --> 01:07:50.019
correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12712-0
01:07:52.519 --> 01:07:52.749
Mm-hmm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12717-0
01:07:53.339 --> 01:07:53.489
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12720-0
01:07:53.629 --> 01:07:53.909
Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12721-0
01:07:53.799 --> 01:07:54.359
Yeah, yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12728-0
01:07:54.719 --> 01:07:55.479
Yeah, but.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12741-0
01:07:55.099 --> 01:08:00.744
So in the if you take if yeah
equal to I you get X&amp;Y to be

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12741-1
01:08:00.744 --> 01:08:01.999
perpendicular.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12746-0
01:08:04.039 --> 01:08:04.299
Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12750-0
01:08:04.639 --> 01:08:05.289
Hmm. Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12772-0
01:08:06.449 --> 01:08:11.491
Let us, if yeah equal to 2001X
and Y need not are not

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12775-0
01:08:07.349 --> 01:08:07.649
Right.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12772-1
01:08:11.491 --> 01:08:12.799
perpendicular.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12774-0
01:08:14.669 --> 01:08:14.989
Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12783-0
01:08:17.199 --> 01:08:17.719
You should.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12797-0
01:08:18.249 --> 01:08:21.798
So you cannot say if it is
perpendicular with respect to

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12797-1
01:08:21.798 --> 01:08:22.919
one inner product.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12810-0
01:08:22.929 --> 01:08:25.159
It is perpendicular with respect
to all the inner products.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12815-0
01:08:25.169 --> 01:08:25.559
Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12838-0
01:08:26.669 --> 01:08:29.555
If there is an inner product,
when you get perpendicularity,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12826-0
01:08:27.509 --> 01:08:27.929
Baby.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12838-1
01:08:29.555 --> 01:08:32.016
there are other inner products
where it need not be

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12838-2
01:08:32.016 --> 01:08:32.679
perpendicular.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12847-0
01:08:33.089 --> 01:08:35.319
This example is just to show
that agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12850-0
01:08:39.609 --> 01:08:39.849
Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12856-0
01:08:41.569 --> 01:08:42.979
Now you can do this.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12862-0
01:08:43.849 --> 01:08:45.219
Ohh, OK OK OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12868-0
01:08:45.229 --> 01:08:46.949
I made a small mistake here.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12874-0
01:08:48.609 --> 01:08:50.009
It's normal exit.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12891-0
01:08:53.239 --> 01:08:58.059
Sorry, there's all my big's
actually extra aspose X.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12902-0
01:09:02.819 --> 01:09:04.679
Because I think, but extras,
those eggs.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12919-0
01:09:05.049 --> 01:09:09.006
This is why transpose Y, because
this is nothing but norm of X

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12919-1
01:09:09.006 --> 01:09:09.949
comma X, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12921-0
01:09:16.799 --> 01:09:17.059
Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12931-0
01:09:19.249 --> 01:09:20.739
So I made a small mistake.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12948-0
01:09:20.749 --> 01:09:24.259
So if you you have to do it, do
it with A and you will get the

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12948-1
01:09:24.259 --> 01:09:24.649
answer.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12960-0
01:09:24.779 --> 01:09:27.749
So this is not minus one by two.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12964-0
01:09:27.759 --> 01:09:28.969
This will be a different answer.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12977-0
01:09:31.229 --> 01:09:32.629
So they do this transpose X.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12981-0
01:09:34.189 --> 01:09:34.439
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/12993-0
01:09:34.449 --> 01:09:35.509
Yeah, you have been with that
please.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13002-0
01:09:34.949 --> 01:09:36.289
I know we can do it ourselves,
Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13006-0
01:09:36.579 --> 01:09:38.669
OK, so you'll get a.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13030-0
01:09:38.779 --> 01:09:43.027
This is the anyway done in the
slide, so you will get a -, 1 by

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13030-1
01:09:43.027 --> 01:09:44.289
3 and you will get.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13039-0
01:09:44.439 --> 01:09:45.609
There are no longer orthogonal.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13037-0
01:09:46.399 --> 01:09:47.249
Well, she can.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13046-0
01:09:47.319 --> 01:09:48.579
Can we do it for others?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13051-0
01:09:48.739 --> 01:09:49.829
Sir, we can do anything.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13059-0
01:09:49.839 --> 01:09:50.379
He understand?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13064-0
01:09:50.389 --> 01:09:51.109
Then we can skip that.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13075-0
01:09:52.309 --> 01:09:54.869
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13077-0
01:09:52.779 --> 01:09:53.739
OK, so they do that.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13086-0
01:09:54.439 --> 01:09:54.839
Yes, please.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13078-0
01:09:54.879 --> 01:09:55.229
Please.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13091-0
01:09:55.239 --> 01:09:55.949
Thank you, Sir please.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13102-0
01:09:56.269 --> 01:09:58.585
But it just matrix
multiplication, we can skip

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13102-1
01:09:58.585 --> 01:09:59.029
actually.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13100-0
01:10:00.089 --> 01:10:00.369
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13111-0
01:10:00.379 --> 01:10:02.239
Let let it be, write it return.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13115-0
01:10:02.249 --> 01:10:03.619
Then everybody can understand.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13136-0
01:10:04.299 --> 01:10:09.671
So X with X with respect to this
ASX transpose X, what is your X

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13136-1
01:10:09.671 --> 01:10:11.159
1 -, 1 or one one?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13150-0
01:10:13.019 --> 01:10:18.619
11 transpose 2001 and then 11.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13153-0
01:10:18.629 --> 01:10:18.879
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13167-0
01:10:19.899 --> 01:10:25.039
So this is nothing but 11200111.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13179-0
01:10:25.829 --> 01:10:27.849
This is nothing but one one.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13184-0
01:10:29.619 --> 01:10:31.699
So one is equal to 3/3.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13222-0
01:10:34.409 --> 01:10:38.116
So, Sir, when you say the X
norm, that means that X inner

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13205-0
01:10:36.209 --> 01:10:37.049
Translate.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13222-1
01:10:38.116 --> 01:10:40.289
product with X with respect to
a.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13214-0
01:10:39.829 --> 01:10:40.499
Yeah, correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13224-0
01:10:40.549 --> 01:10:41.499
So this is not next.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13230-0
01:10:41.509 --> 01:10:42.039
The whole square.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13234-0
01:10:43.859 --> 01:10:44.999
Therefore, what is Nomex?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13257-0
01:10:47.349 --> 01:10:49.039
This is equal to sqrt 3,
correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13251-0
01:10:47.419 --> 01:10:48.039
Under root of.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13264-0
01:10:49.329 --> 01:10:50.289
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13288-0
01:10:50.759 --> 01:10:53.768
If you do the same thing with
Norm, why you are again going to

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13288-1
01:10:53.768 --> 01:10:54.819
get sqrt 3, I suppose.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13289-0
01:10:53.809 --> 01:10:55.799
Under root of three, yes, yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13294-0
01:10:58.409 --> 01:10:58.809
Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13296-0
01:10:58.819 --> 01:10:59.299
OK, fine.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13299-0
01:11:02.479 --> 01:11:03.149
OK, now.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13321-0
01:11:06.599 --> 01:11:09.857
You will find that, uh, Esquire
matrix is orthogonally if and

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13321-1
01:11:09.857 --> 01:11:11.749
only if it's columns or
orthogonal.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13350-0
01:11:11.759 --> 01:11:15.252
You will find for orthogonal
matrices a trans pose and a

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13350-1
01:11:15.252 --> 01:11:19.112
transpose are one and the same
thing because Anand inverse and

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13350-2
01:11:19.112 --> 01:11:21.809
A transpose are the same
quantities, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13375-0
01:11:22.239 --> 01:11:25.628
So you'll find that a transfer
this A transpose A and a

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13375-1
01:11:25.628 --> 01:11:27.929
transpose are both equal to
identity.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13395-0
01:11:29.139 --> 01:11:33.528
Now, if the columns of the
matrix are orthonormal, the rows

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13395-1
01:11:33.528 --> 01:11:35.869
are also orthogonal orthonormal.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13433-0
01:11:36.479 --> 01:11:41.636
Now there is a very simple thing
which says that if a square

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13433-1
01:11:41.636 --> 01:11:46.878
matrix with the B&amp;C has left
and right inverses of a such

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13433-2
01:11:46.878 --> 01:11:49.499
that BA equal to I equal to AC.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13441-0
01:11:49.909 --> 01:11:51.839
This means that B&amp;C are
equal.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13454-0
01:11:52.609 --> 01:11:55.189
Are you able to see directly or
should I have to prove it?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13477-0
01:12:08.249 --> 01:12:09.179
Would I have to prove it?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13479-0
01:12:08.439 --> 01:12:10.783
Then what is the difference
between orthogonal and

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13479-1
01:12:10.783 --> 01:12:11.519
orthonormal Sir?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13485-0
01:12:14.759 --> 01:12:15.719
Who asked me this question.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13493-0
01:12:18.829 --> 01:12:19.209
Myself.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13501-0
01:12:20.539 --> 01:12:21.299
You tell me your name?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13504-0
01:12:21.309 --> 01:12:21.649
Nah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13511-0
01:12:22.269 --> 01:12:22.959
So gonna figure.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13513-0
01:12:23.439 --> 01:12:24.249
What is it going?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13530-0
01:12:24.699 --> 01:12:30.539
No, there are vectors V1V2 up to
VN now.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13537-0
01:12:30.599 --> 01:12:32.629
They satisfy your property such
that.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13559-0
01:12:35.349 --> 01:12:40.727
BITS with BJ you get equal to 0
whenever I is not equal to J,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13559-1
01:12:40.727 --> 01:12:43.069
they are called orthogonal.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13562-0
01:12:50.289 --> 01:12:50.759
Agreed.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13586-0
01:12:55.649 --> 01:12:59.799
So there inner product this is
inner product, right? OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13584-0
01:12:57.879 --> 01:12:58.829
He never 0.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13587-0
01:13:00.879 --> 01:13:01.029
Now.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13600-0
01:13:03.519 --> 01:13:08.609
If V1 up to VNR orthogonal.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13607-0
01:13:10.169 --> 01:13:13.669
Aye, VIB i.e.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13617-0
01:13:13.679 --> 01:13:16.339
Equal to 1 for all I.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13619-0
01:13:16.389 --> 01:13:17.359
Then there are orthonormal.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13628-0
01:13:24.669 --> 01:13:26.239
OK example.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13630-0
01:13:26.909 --> 01:13:28.009
So said not getting.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13641-0
01:13:29.359 --> 01:13:33.189
One 1 -, 1, one are they auto.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13644-0
01:13:33.199 --> 01:13:33.939
Are the gonal?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13655-0
01:13:36.459 --> 01:13:40.639
You take inner product to be dot
product.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13661-0
01:13:43.469 --> 01:13:45.389
Now, are these two orthogonal?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13669-0
01:13:50.259 --> 01:13:51.279
Yes, this is 0.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13685-0
01:13:52.289 --> 01:13:55.461
One into minus 1 + 1 into one is
0, so they are orthogonal,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13685-1
01:13:55.461 --> 01:13:55.779
right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13689-0
01:13:57.549 --> 01:13:57.679
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13696-0
01:13:58.629 --> 01:14:01.969
But you try V1 with V1.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13705-0
01:14:02.289 --> 01:14:04.489
What is it one one with one, one
right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13720-0
01:14:09.659 --> 01:14:10.559
Yeah, it's not 1.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13723-0
01:14:11.399 --> 01:14:12.819
No, it is not equal to what.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13736-0
01:14:13.179 --> 01:14:16.819
Therefore, what you do is is to
make it orthonormal.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13751-0
01:14:16.829 --> 01:14:20.159
What you do is you divide both
of both sides by sqrt 2.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13767-0
01:14:23.059 --> 01:14:25.809
Now you do minus one by root 21
by root two.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13771-0
01:14:26.259 --> 01:14:27.669
Are they orthogonal now?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13785-0
01:14:35.599 --> 01:14:36.499
Because either, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13815-0
01:14:37.309 --> 01:14:40.228
Now you're gonna 01 by, so I
don't scare of two into minus

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13815-1
01:14:40.228 --> 01:14:43.196
one by square root 2 + 1 by
square two in one by sqrt 2 you

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13815-2
01:14:43.196 --> 01:14:43.889
get 0 correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13821-0
01:14:44.819 --> 01:14:45.139
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13829-0
01:14:45.319 --> 01:14:47.459
Yeah, there's also Google.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13847-0
01:14:46.749 --> 01:14:51.943
Now ah, so if you do 1 by sqrt 2
with one by sqrt 2 and with

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13847-1
01:14:51.943 --> 01:14:52.539
itself.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13855-0
01:14:57.019 --> 01:14:57.609
You have an.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13900-0
01:15:00.059 --> 01:15:04.332
Emily, when you're do it with
inner part with minus one by

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13900-1
01:15:04.332 --> 01:15:08.678
sqrt 2, one by sqrt 2 and minus
one by sqrt 2 one by sqrt 2

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13900-2
01:15:08.678 --> 01:15:10.779
again you'll get a 1 correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13907-0
01:15:11.929 --> 01:15:12.259
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13908-0
01:15:12.759 --> 01:15:13.629
This is orthonormal.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13929-0
01:15:17.479 --> 01:15:25.644
So what the theorem says is,
suppose you have a B&amp;C as

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13929-1
01:15:25.644 --> 01:15:29.519
the left and write inverses.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13954-0
01:15:32.139 --> 01:15:36.996
Of a that means left inverse of
a means B into a will be

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13954-1
01:15:36.996 --> 01:15:38.189
identity also.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13957-0
01:15:39.459 --> 01:15:40.249
Yeah, into.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13961-0
01:15:40.259 --> 01:15:41.609
See equal to identity.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13966-0
01:15:41.679 --> 01:15:44.059
So you can say BA.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/13978-0
01:15:45.639 --> 01:15:47.909
Equal to ID equal to AC.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14001-0
01:15:48.299 --> 01:15:51.946
If this happens then you can
have B equal to C are you able

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14001-1
01:15:51.946 --> 01:15:54.439
to see it clearly, or should I
prove it?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14002-0
01:15:55.279 --> 01:15:55.979
Please process.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14015-0
01:15:59.229 --> 01:15:59.969
And this is good.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14020-0
01:16:00.129 --> 01:16:01.029
It's clear it's clear.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14032-0
01:16:02.319 --> 01:16:04.529
Now don't think that you can
cancel and A here.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14039-0
01:16:03.779 --> 01:16:04.509
This is clear but.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14043-0
01:16:04.799 --> 01:16:07.699
That's a difference between
scalars and matrices, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14079-0
01:16:11.829 --> 01:16:16.259
If I have an equation 3 into 2
equal to two into XI can

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14079-1
01:16:16.259 --> 01:16:21.006
directly cancel this too with
these two and then say that X

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14079-2
01:16:21.006 --> 01:16:22.589
equal to 3, correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14083-0
01:16:26.789 --> 01:16:26.959
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14098-0
01:16:28.629 --> 01:16:30.579
But you can't do the same thing
in matrices.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14112-0
01:16:30.589 --> 01:16:33.849
Matrices will have a slightly
different role to play in that.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14114-0
01:16:36.129 --> 01:16:36.369
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14124-0
01:16:38.639 --> 01:16:39.029
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14129-0
01:16:39.669 --> 01:16:40.159
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14130-0
01:16:39.939 --> 01:16:40.179
Hmm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14137-0
01:16:39.969 --> 01:16:43.348
So if the columns are
orthonormal, then you can even

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14137-1
01:16:43.348 --> 01:16:43.859
do this.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14154-0
01:16:43.869 --> 01:16:46.899
So I will try to tell you one
line proof about this.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14164-0
01:16:47.589 --> 01:16:50.139
What you do is you start with a
matrix called B.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14179-0
01:16:50.189 --> 01:16:53.229
See, this is a typical idea if
you ask me.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14188-0
01:16:53.239 --> 01:16:55.359
The intuition where did I get
this be from?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14197-0
01:16:55.529 --> 01:16:57.519
I need to prove that B equal to
C, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14206-0
01:17:00.879 --> 01:17:01.009
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14208-0
01:17:00.919 --> 01:17:01.529
Yeah, sure.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14226-0
01:17:02.139 --> 01:17:06.040
So I started the B and I write
this as B into I you will agree

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14226-1
01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:06.969
with me, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14228-0
01:17:07.769 --> 01:17:07.969
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14231-0
01:17:08.269 --> 01:17:09.089
OK. Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14240-0
01:17:10.719 --> 01:17:13.199
And this IE will be equal to AC
correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14244-0
01:17:15.249 --> 01:17:15.549
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14246-0
01:17:15.789 --> 01:17:16.249
Yeah, sure.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14251-0
01:17:17.659 --> 01:17:19.559
Now what is B into a?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14255-0
01:17:21.669 --> 01:17:22.079
I.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14256-0
01:17:22.749 --> 01:17:22.989
Hi.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14257-0
01:17:22.909 --> 01:17:23.199
I.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14265-0
01:17:25.499 --> 01:17:25.739
See.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14267-0
01:17:25.739 --> 01:17:27.859
You see, so pleased to see.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14272-0
01:17:29.099 --> 01:17:29.799
Is it not simple?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14275-0
01:17:33.169 --> 01:17:33.289
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14276-0
01:17:34.589 --> 01:17:34.969
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14287-0
01:17:40.359 --> 01:17:43.209
OK, this is what I have told
about this.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14312-0
01:17:46.199 --> 01:17:49.659
You you can use the typical
thing as the dot product

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14312-1
01:17:49.659 --> 01:17:51.879
whenever it is, it is
convenient.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14337-0
01:17:51.889 --> 01:17:56.060
You don't have to use a general
inner product, and you can prove

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14337-1
01:17:56.060 --> 01:17:58.949
some some nice theorems for the
dot product.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14360-0
01:17:59.359 --> 01:18:02.232
Now whatever you prove for dot
product, including

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14360-1
01:18:02.232 --> 01:18:05.509
orthogonality, you cannot prove
using the general stuff.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14386-0
01:18:05.899 --> 01:18:12.011
So you can you can generally
keep avoiding them, but there is

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14386-1
01:18:12.011 --> 01:18:16.349
one case where and you get the
same result.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14399-0
01:18:16.439 --> 01:18:20.689
That is for an orthogonal matrix
or even orthonormal matrix.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14407-0
01:18:20.699 --> 01:18:23.279
So I will try to tell you that
so.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14431-0
01:18:30.349 --> 01:18:36.193
What did I prove previously that
you can find a X by the inner

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14431-1
01:18:36.193 --> 01:18:39.069
product to be equal to extract.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14443-0
01:18:39.079 --> 01:18:43.979
Suppose Y for which you can
create something like.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14471-0
01:18:44.809 --> 01:18:49.723
In this case, X&amp;Y to be
perpendicular, but as when you

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14471-1
01:18:49.723 --> 01:18:54.470
took X&amp;Y to be extra
transpose AY, then X&amp;Y were

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14471-2
01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:56.719
not perpendicular. Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14475-0
01:18:58.089 --> 01:18:58.249
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14479-0
01:18:58.919 --> 01:18:59.379
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14481-0
01:18:59.709 --> 01:19:01.599
OK, now the question is.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14520-0
01:19:05.679 --> 01:19:11.715
If I say that I am not working
with any general air, but I am

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14520-1
01:19:11.715 --> 01:19:17.947
working with a particular yeah,
now that particular A is the my

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14520-2
01:19:17.947 --> 01:19:20.089
afternoon when matrix.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14523-0
01:19:22.579 --> 01:19:22.859
Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14546-0
01:19:25.869 --> 01:19:30.007
If I if I work with an
orthonormal matrix then it'll

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14546-1
01:19:30.007 --> 01:19:31.959
preserve all the lengths.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14553-0
01:19:31.969 --> 01:19:33.699
So what does it mean so?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14572-0
01:19:37.659 --> 01:19:41.732
The length within X&amp;Y is
nothing but extra extra aspose

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14572-1
01:19:41.732 --> 01:19:42.479
ay correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14585-0
01:19:45.209 --> 01:19:45.739
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14583-0
01:19:45.289 --> 01:19:45.649
Yes, yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14586-0
01:19:46.719 --> 01:19:47.609
Now we have transpose.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14590-0
01:19:47.619 --> 01:19:48.459
Airways is Kayla.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14601-0
01:19:49.959 --> 01:19:50.579
You agree with me.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14606-0
01:19:51.609 --> 01:19:51.749
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14609-0
01:19:52.199 --> 01:19:53.489
That this will proved yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14616-0
01:19:54.049 --> 01:19:57.169
OK, now the point is if you
have.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14622-0
01:20:02.329 --> 01:20:03.659
Eggs square.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14624-0
01:20:05.779 --> 01:20:06.119
Or.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14637-0
01:20:08.249 --> 01:20:11.379
Auto normal game.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14644-0
01:20:12.839 --> 01:20:16.629
Now this is nothing but uh,
what?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14652-0
01:20:16.639 --> 01:20:17.759
How can you approximate this?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14655-0
01:20:17.769 --> 01:20:18.329
A square?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14662-0
01:20:19.289 --> 01:20:22.679
Now a expire, he's nothing but.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14668-0
01:20:25.279 --> 01:20:26.429
X and the X right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14671-0
01:20:28.929 --> 01:20:29.129
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14672-0
01:20:29.249 --> 01:20:29.429
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14697-0
01:20:32.199 --> 01:20:36.828
So if you use the typical dot
product, this is nothing but a

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14697-1
01:20:36.828 --> 01:20:40.319
extra aspose, A transpose times
a X, correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14708-0
01:20:43.199 --> 01:20:43.729
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14713-0
01:20:44.679 --> 01:20:45.529
So this is nothing.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14711-0
01:20:45.199 --> 01:20:45.499
Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14722-0
01:20:45.539 --> 01:20:49.209
But yeah, the transpose of 1
number times the other.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14732-0
01:20:49.289 --> 01:20:50.809
That is what I have written here
man.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14736-0
01:20:50.879 --> 01:20:51.819
If I use a dot product.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14769-0
01:20:54.919 --> 01:20:59.792
But this is equal to X transpose
a transpose into a X which is

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14769-1
01:20:59.792 --> 01:21:04.589
equal to X transpose into IX
which is equal to X transpose X.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14771-0
01:21:05.119 --> 01:21:05.449
Why?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14791-0
01:21:05.459 --> 01:21:08.772
Because A is orthonormal, A
transpose A will be an identity

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14791-1
01:21:08.772 --> 01:21:09.159
matrix.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14793-0
01:21:11.179 --> 01:21:11.439
Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14799-0
01:21:15.809 --> 01:21:15.959
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14803-0
01:21:16.939 --> 01:21:17.169
Right.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14807-0
01:21:17.389 --> 01:21:18.899
So this is a.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14814-0
01:21:18.909 --> 01:21:20.199
This is really XNXX.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14838-0
01:21:20.209 --> 01:21:24.329
This is a distance between
X&amp;AX, so yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14887-0
01:21:20.669 --> 01:21:25.605
Uh, so just a question, so sorry
to interrupt you, but just a

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14887-1
01:21:25.605 --> 01:21:30.542
question you have written that
the uh AX comma X and then you

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14887-2
01:21:30.542 --> 01:21:35.638
have put the like X transpose A
transpose and then AX shouldn't

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14887-3
01:21:35.638 --> 01:21:39.699
be a transpose X transport and
bracket and then X.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14879-0
01:21:35.759 --> 01:21:36.009
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14895-0
01:21:40.469 --> 01:21:42.479
No, this is nothing but games.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14901-0
01:21:42.489 --> 01:21:44.369
The whole transpose into eggs.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14910-0
01:21:45.419 --> 01:21:46.929
You use the definition, not.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14918-0
01:21:47.209 --> 01:21:48.149
Yeah. OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14930-0
01:21:47.749 --> 01:21:50.408
You take the first first day
element and take the transpose,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14930-1
01:21:50.408 --> 01:21:51.629
multiply the second element.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14933-0
01:21:52.069 --> 01:21:52.309
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14950-0
01:21:53.569 --> 01:21:56.041
I took the first element there,
took the transpose onto the

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14950-1
01:21:56.041 --> 01:21:56.659
second element.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14953-0
01:21:57.929 --> 01:21:58.589
Yeah, alright.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14955-0
01:21:59.239 --> 01:21:59.839
OK, fine.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14973-0
01:22:00.849 --> 01:22:06.129
So what they do is I find norm
of X and norm of AX.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/14980-0
01:22:06.139 --> 01:22:07.389
This is norm of X square.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15012-0
01:22:09.249 --> 01:22:13.288
So the norm of expire the length
of X and length of a X for an

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15012-1
01:22:13.288 --> 01:22:16.879
orthogonal matrix orthonormal
matrix is 1 and the same.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15031-0
01:22:17.249 --> 01:22:20.575
So what I need to say is, you
know what happens when I

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15031-1
01:22:20.575 --> 01:22:22.209
multiply a matrix director?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15039-0
01:22:27.929 --> 01:22:28.409
Nobody knows.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15046-0
01:22:28.999 --> 01:22:32.019
All the elements of metrics with
the vector.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15051-0
01:22:32.799 --> 01:22:33.139
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15055-0
01:22:33.759 --> 01:22:34.879
We get another victim.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15057-0
01:22:34.569 --> 01:22:34.909
Met.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15062-0
01:22:36.299 --> 01:22:36.459
No.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15076-0
01:22:36.449 --> 01:22:37.579
Yeah, they were the.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15086-0
01:22:37.609 --> 01:22:40.249
What happens in the matrix and
vector is something like.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15093-0
01:22:39.169 --> 01:22:42.569
Etcetera and formation in the
same same space.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15103-0
01:22:43.639 --> 01:22:46.169
That is all OK, it is.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15112-0
01:22:46.089 --> 01:22:46.539
Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15120-0
01:22:46.179 --> 01:22:47.999
If I take a vector in two
dimension.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15127-0
01:22:47.149 --> 01:22:49.769
Sir matrix get multiplied with
this scalar value.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15135-0
01:22:50.999 --> 01:22:52.329
There is nothing like scalar
Karna.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15150-0
01:22:53.769 --> 01:22:58.199
Now there is something like a
vector X and I give a matrix A.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15161-0
01:22:58.309 --> 01:23:01.399
If you multiply with a,
generally 2 processes occur.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15180-0
01:23:01.469 --> 01:23:04.901
One is, it can either get
elongated or compressed, but

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15180-1
01:23:04.901 --> 01:23:06.399
it'll change when angle.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15183-0
01:23:09.999 --> 01:23:10.259
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15206-0
01:23:14.689 --> 01:23:20.117
If you take your ex to be equal
to 1, two and A to be equal to

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15206-1
01:23:20.117 --> 01:23:22.099
should be very careful.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15209-0
01:23:23.819 --> 01:23:25.849
2 -, 1.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15216-0
01:23:27.979 --> 01:23:29.769
3 -, 1.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15228-0
01:23:29.779 --> 01:23:31.229
Suppose I'll take an A like
this.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15238-0
01:23:31.719 --> 01:23:33.469
You can plot this one too,
right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15256-0
01:23:33.599 --> 01:23:37.424
The two dimensional space this
is 1/2, so you took original

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15256-1
01:23:37.424 --> 01:23:38.189
vector here.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15260-0
01:23:40.599 --> 01:23:40.939
Agreed.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15273-0
01:23:42.779 --> 01:23:42.899
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15286-0
01:23:43.349 --> 01:23:43.949
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15288-0
01:23:43.839 --> 01:23:45.689
Now, what is the X you tell me
quickly.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15290-0
01:23:44.399 --> 01:23:45.899
To this is that this.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15291-0
01:23:45.699 --> 01:23:46.349
What is X?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15306-0
01:23:50.209 --> 01:23:55.179
We will be multiplying it right
112.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15304-0
01:23:52.749 --> 01:23:53.349
Minus one.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15314-0
01:23:55.759 --> 01:23:59.229
That what is a XMA.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15327-0
01:24:02.319 --> 01:24:03.459
And zero and.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15342-0
01:24:03.849 --> 01:24:04.989
Just send it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15330-0
01:24:03.859 --> 01:24:04.089
Uh.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15335-0
01:24:04.069 --> 01:24:05.089
11.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15343-0
01:24:05.989 --> 01:24:06.309
Little one.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15357-0
01:24:06.239 --> 01:24:08.619
0101 is somewhere here correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15356-0
01:24:06.449 --> 01:24:07.369
You know, yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15355-0
01:24:07.119 --> 01:24:07.499
You know one.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15364-0
01:24:12.349 --> 01:24:12.509
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15362-0
01:24:12.369 --> 01:24:12.589
This.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15370-0
01:24:12.929 --> 01:24:13.689
Correct, correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15387-0
01:24:14.219 --> 01:24:18.513
So the original vector it
changes its length and it gets

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15378-0
01:24:14.659 --> 01:24:15.969
You need to me.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15387-1
01:24:18.513 --> 01:24:20.699
rotated by an angle, correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15395-0
01:24:22.659 --> 01:24:22.819
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15393-0
01:24:23.039 --> 01:24:23.289
Look.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15398-0
01:24:23.049 --> 01:24:23.289
Right.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15401-0
01:24:23.349 --> 01:24:23.859
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15405-0
01:24:23.979 --> 01:24:24.249
Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15413-0
01:24:24.999 --> 01:24:26.079
You need you.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15430-0
01:24:25.349 --> 01:24:31.147
So but if you take an orthogonal
matrix, if you take an

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15430-1
01:24:31.147 --> 01:24:37.359
orthogonal wonderful matrix, you
can see only angle change.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15437-0
01:24:40.179 --> 01:24:41.479
No one thing is change.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15449-0
01:24:44.479 --> 01:24:45.939
Now, what is the length of this
vector?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15450-0
01:24:45.409 --> 01:24:45.759
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15493-0
01:24:51.339 --> 01:24:54.848
But since the previous uh
example, I mean previous

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15493-1
01:24:54.848 --> 01:24:58.839
equation it was for orthonormal
orthogonal portal Norman.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15502-0
01:24:57.669 --> 01:24:59.729
What I'm saying you can take
out, I have to go to the

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15502-1
01:24:59.729 --> 01:25:00.759
orthonormal doesn't matter.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15507-0
01:25:00.769 --> 01:25:03.099
It will not change the length,
it'll change the angle.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15510-0
01:25:08.769 --> 01:25:09.109
Agreed.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15520-0
01:25:10.529 --> 01:25:10.679
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15546-0
01:25:11.069 --> 01:25:14.639
That is, is it because we have
normalized it with the norm and

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15525-0
01:25:11.339 --> 01:25:11.759
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15546-1
01:25:14.639 --> 01:25:18.039
the above equation and that's
why the angle will change but

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15546-2
01:25:18.039 --> 01:25:18.889
not the length?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15579-0
01:25:20.289 --> 01:25:25.212
Uh, because of this theorem, now
with the acquire and norm of X

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15568-0
01:25:22.749 --> 01:25:23.899
Yeah, yeah, yeah, there.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15579-1
01:25:25.212 --> 01:25:27.059
square will be the same.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15597-0
01:25:27.069 --> 01:25:30.147
So you took some except for
which there is a norm of X

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15597-1
01:25:30.147 --> 01:25:30.539
square.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15606-0
01:25:30.549 --> 01:25:31.719
Now you calculate the AX.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15630-0
01:25:31.729 --> 01:25:34.726
The whole square norm it will be
same as norm X square, which

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15630-1
01:25:34.726 --> 01:25:37.724
means it doesn't change because
of the orthogonal property of

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15630-2
01:25:37.724 --> 01:25:37.869
it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15656-0
01:25:41.089 --> 01:25:42.969
Versus this thing we proved for
orthonormal.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15649-0
01:25:41.499 --> 01:25:42.089
Alright, thank you.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15650-0
01:25:41.979 --> 01:25:42.249
The.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15673-0
01:25:44.249 --> 01:25:48.269
I I have about half the normal N
agonal R for this they're one

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15673-1
01:25:48.269 --> 01:25:49.099
and the same.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15704-0
01:25:49.109 --> 01:25:52.840
I'm not call you to utilizing
that norm of every column will

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15704-1
01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:56.327
be equal to 1 whatever I am
proving for orthogonal I can

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15704-2
01:25:56.327 --> 01:25:57.979
prove for orthonormal also.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15705-0
01:25:59.009 --> 01:25:59.279
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15707-0
01:25:59.289 --> 01:26:00.439
OK, understood.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15714-0
01:26:02.389 --> 01:26:02.869
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15736-0
01:26:02.879 --> 01:26:06.737
In general, orthogonal meetings
in two dimension has this form

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15736-1
01:26:06.737 --> 01:26:09.739
cost data minus sign, data sign,
data cost data.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15768-0
01:26:10.309 --> 01:26:14.426
You can for example take Theta
equal to 30405060708090 whatever

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15768-1
01:26:14.426 --> 01:26:17.129
you want and you get orthogonal
matrices.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15778-0
01:26:17.139 --> 01:26:20.825
So you can produce infinite
infinitely many orthogonal

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15778-1
01:26:20.825 --> 01:26:21.429
matrices.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15811-0
01:26:21.439 --> 01:26:24.699
Yeah, this is also orthonormal
because cost creditor sends

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15811-1
01:26:24.699 --> 01:26:27.739
credit is one in the first
column and cause minus 1 ^2

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15811-2
01:26:27.739 --> 01:26:28.789
plus, but minus 90.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15827-0
01:26:28.799 --> 01:26:31.586
The whole square does cost
square data will be equal to 1,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15827-1
01:26:31.586 --> 01:26:32.909
so this is also orthonormal.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15838-0
01:26:34.719 --> 01:26:36.969
OK, this is what I have written.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15840-0
01:26:36.979 --> 01:26:37.289
What?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15845-0
01:26:37.299 --> 01:26:39.519
Whatever we want, we have.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15856-0
01:26:40.279 --> 01:26:43.929
We have done previously can be
extended here.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15890-0
01:26:44.279 --> 01:26:48.176
Now if you have orthonormal
matrix then you will have an

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15890-1
01:26:48.176 --> 01:26:52.211
extra expose a transpose a here
and this is that basically

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15890-2
01:26:52.211 --> 01:26:53.989
nothing but X transpose Y.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15930-0
01:26:54.219 --> 01:26:58.088
So X transpose Y by norm of X
into norm of this is can be

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15930-1
01:26:58.088 --> 01:27:02.023
equal to Cos of Omega and you
can find out the angle Omega

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15930-2
01:27:02.023 --> 01:27:05.759
extraposed Y is a scalar and and
all of its and normal.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15941-0
01:27:05.769 --> 01:27:07.079
Why are two scalar?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15958-0
01:27:07.089 --> 01:27:09.969
So this is a legitimate thing as
long as X&amp;Y are non 0.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15963-0
01:27:11.349 --> 01:27:13.739
Now why is this?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15975-0
01:27:14.209 --> 01:27:16.719
Why can't this be equal equal to
a cost?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15979-0
01:27:17.249 --> 01:27:18.049
You know the reason why.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15988-0
01:27:20.219 --> 01:27:21.329
Yeah, minus one to one.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/15999-0
01:27:21.339 --> 01:27:22.329
It will lie between.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16011-0
01:27:22.309 --> 01:27:25.944
All the guys have Cauchy Schwarz
inequality agree, so the

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16011-1
01:27:25.944 --> 01:27:28.639
numerator is smaller compared
denominator.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16025-0
01:27:29.089 --> 01:27:33.869
Now you can do this minus one
and one disks take uh.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16036-0
01:27:35.749 --> 01:27:37.659
Why is a transpose A is equal
to?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16054-0
01:27:37.709 --> 01:27:39.329
I didn't is equal to.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16060-0
01:27:39.089 --> 01:27:42.519
A transpose A equal to 1 because
A is an orthonormal matrix, no?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16067-0
01:27:44.729 --> 01:27:45.069
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16107-0
01:27:45.829 --> 01:27:48.565
Yeah, transpose and a inverse
are one of the same, so A

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16080-0
01:27:47.009 --> 01:27:47.369
Or.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16107-1
01:27:48.565 --> 01:27:51.351
transpose wherever A transpose
is there you substitute a

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16107-2
01:27:51.351 --> 01:27:54.528
inverse, a inverse all be equal
to 1, and then you will get this

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16107-3
01:27:54.528 --> 01:27:54.919
example.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16124-0
01:27:54.929 --> 01:27:56.239
So every norm of X norm of X.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16133-0
01:27:57.429 --> 01:27:59.849
Sir, how norm of a X is equal to
norm of X?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16143-0
01:28:01.849 --> 01:28:03.379
Some of the X equal to X.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16158-0
01:28:03.389 --> 01:28:06.989
That is, when you didn't follow
that derivation.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16156-0
01:28:05.989 --> 01:28:06.559
Prove it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16159-0
01:28:06.609 --> 01:28:07.229
He proved it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16181-0
01:28:09.919 --> 01:28:13.049
OK, so change in the angle
ordinal level.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16177-0
01:28:12.519 --> 01:28:13.199
No change.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16183-0
01:28:13.209 --> 01:28:14.849
It likely normal eggs.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16197-0
01:28:14.859 --> 01:28:18.519
The whole square is nothing but
eggs with eggs, correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16224-0
01:28:20.089 --> 01:28:23.817
This is nothing but the
transpose of the first made, the

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16214-0
01:28:20.449 --> 01:28:21.149
Yes, so.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16224-1
01:28:23.817 --> 01:28:25.779
first rector times the second.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16271-0
01:28:26.609 --> 01:28:30.403
This is nothing but extra spose
A transpose times a X which is

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16271-1
01:28:30.403 --> 01:28:33.776
nothing but X transpose X
because A transpose A will be

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16264-0
01:28:33.299 --> 01:28:33.709
Got it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16268-0
01:28:33.719 --> 01:28:34.059
Got it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16271-2
01:28:33.776 --> 01:28:34.499
equal to ID.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16276-0
01:28:35.009 --> 01:28:35.979
So this is the.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16282-0
01:28:35.099 --> 01:28:35.879
Right, right, right.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16287-0
01:28:36.229 --> 01:28:38.039
This is normally the whole
spread, agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16293-0
01:28:38.519 --> 01:28:40.899
Yes, I yes, sorry, yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16294-0
01:28:39.899 --> 01:28:41.599
OK, bye.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16296-0
01:28:44.279 --> 01:28:44.759
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16313-0
01:28:46.609 --> 01:28:47.989
OK, I will not.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16311-0
01:28:47.079 --> 01:28:48.819
So here we are taking the
square.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16337-0
01:28:48.829 --> 01:28:51.078
The other algorithm right
everywhere where we're

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16337-1
01:28:51.078 --> 01:28:53.879
calculating the norm and we're
not taking the the first one.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16351-0
01:28:54.799 --> 01:28:57.329
I forgot the name, you know.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16349-0
01:28:56.779 --> 01:28:57.219
Which one?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16359-0
01:28:57.449 --> 01:29:00.579
It DOSHI causes this cause
something Manhattan?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16379-0
01:29:00.589 --> 01:29:03.359
One Manhattan you're telling
right meant.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16371-0
01:29:02.499 --> 01:29:03.489
No, no, no.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16376-0
01:29:02.769 --> 01:29:02.909
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16385-0
01:29:04.119 --> 01:29:04.889
No, no, no, no, no.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16389-0
01:29:04.529 --> 01:29:06.559
So we are not taking that
Manhattan in account.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16401-0
01:29:06.569 --> 01:29:08.389
We are always going with the
square 1, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16410-0
01:29:08.729 --> 01:29:10.259
Yeah, correct the Euclidean.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16411-0
01:29:11.119 --> 01:29:11.969
Yeah. Euclidean.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16416-0
01:29:11.249 --> 01:29:11.879
He created.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16423-0
01:29:11.979 --> 01:29:12.479
OK, yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16441-0
01:29:12.429 --> 01:29:15.059
So that's that's what we always
use need to use her.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16449-0
01:29:15.899 --> 01:29:18.429
You can use any other norm also
that that doesn't matter.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16451-0
01:29:19.599 --> 01:29:19.819
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16471-0
01:29:21.549 --> 01:29:24.795
OK, now I'm going to get into
something called the ground

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16471-1
01:29:24.795 --> 01:29:25.579
speed process.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16488-0
01:29:25.589 --> 01:29:27.409
I'll explain this graph speed
process.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16494-0
01:29:26.879 --> 01:29:29.919
I said can we take a 5 minute
break before we start new?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16498-0
01:29:30.429 --> 01:29:30.869
Yeah. OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16504-0
01:29:32.029 --> 01:29:32.519
Thank you, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16512-0
01:29:32.979 --> 01:29:35.809
Case it so I'll be available.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16510-0
01:29:33.649 --> 01:29:34.069
Thank you.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16527-0
01:29:35.819 --> 01:29:38.442
So if others have anything you
can ask, otherwise others can

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16527-1
01:29:38.442 --> 01:29:39.389
take a 5 minute break.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16542-0
01:29:47.459 --> 01:29:48.919
So can you explain that?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16553-0
01:29:48.759 --> 01:29:51.839
So one quick question, so let's.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16546-0
01:29:49.779 --> 01:29:50.309
Poly no.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16552-0
01:29:50.409 --> 01:29:50.739
Do you know?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16554-0
01:29:51.819 --> 01:29:51.979
What?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16584-0
01:29:54.579 --> 01:29:58.247
No, in general I wanted to ask
like if let's say in your

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16584-1
01:29:58.247 --> 01:30:01.529
absence I want to understand any
concept in depth.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16615-0
01:30:01.539 --> 01:30:05.539
So these are all covered in T1
and T2 books textbook books,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16601-0
01:30:04.659 --> 01:30:04.949
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16616-0
01:30:04.959 --> 01:30:06.749
Yeah, it is all covered in T1
and T2.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16615-1
01:30:05.539 --> 01:30:05.939
right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16634-0
01:30:07.219 --> 01:30:11.595
I have also given you something
on Gilbert Strang's book on line

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16627-0
01:30:08.369 --> 01:30:08.729
Alright.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16634-1
01:30:11.595 --> 01:30:11.999
Libra.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16641-0
01:30:13.939 --> 01:30:14.259
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16676-0
01:30:15.059 --> 01:30:18.520
T1 and T2 are something like,
you know, they explain a concept

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16676-1
01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:22.035
in 2 pages the same 2 pages can
will be explained in about 8 to

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16676-2
01:30:22.035 --> 01:30:23.519
10 pages in Gilbert Strang.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16681-0
01:30:26.929 --> 01:30:27.419
Hello.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16692-0
01:30:27.849 --> 01:30:27.999
Hello.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16706-0
01:30:28.079 --> 01:30:28.329
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16722-0
01:30:28.179 --> 01:30:29.759
Yeah, got it. Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16721-0
01:30:28.239 --> 01:30:29.489
You're breaking, yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16733-0
01:30:30.709 --> 01:30:34.981
So the same 2 pages in T1 and T2
will be explained in eight to 10

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16733-1
01:30:34.981 --> 01:30:36.729
pages in Gilbert Transport.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16737-0
01:30:39.199 --> 01:30:40.899
OK, understood. OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16750-0
01:30:46.139 --> 01:30:49.289
So can you attach lecture 0
slides as well?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16762-0
01:30:51.399 --> 01:30:52.519
Let's say he was like to what?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16771-0
01:30:54.069 --> 01:30:55.509
Can you attach in the canvas?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16774-0
01:30:56.439 --> 01:30:56.989
It is already.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16795-0
01:30:58.399 --> 01:31:01.429
Only 1234 is there, 0 is not
there.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16796-0
01:31:01.039 --> 01:31:01.549
How come?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16801-0
01:31:01.339 --> 01:31:04.449
Lecture zeros as they are
available in the announcements.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16807-0
01:31:07.649 --> 01:31:08.059
Take it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16810-0
01:31:08.069 --> 01:31:08.909
It is there in canvas.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16834-0
01:31:12.239 --> 01:31:15.569
That he he's meaning to state,
not in the module, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16830-0
01:31:12.329 --> 01:31:14.749
Yes, but but not under.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16845-0
01:31:15.639 --> 01:31:16.099
Yeah, yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16850-0
01:31:15.739 --> 01:31:18.599
Module I think, Sir, but we have
put it in the announcement, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16852-0
01:31:17.289 --> 01:31:19.779
They Baba correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16865-0
01:31:19.819 --> 01:31:23.659
So that is before this, all
these things are created.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16876-0
01:31:23.669 --> 01:31:26.344
We did not want to create
confusion, but you find it in

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16876-1
01:31:26.344 --> 01:31:26.679
canvas.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16884-0
01:31:29.699 --> 01:31:30.699
You are not able to find it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16888-0
01:31:37.129 --> 01:31:37.349
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16896-0
01:31:37.359 --> 01:31:38.469
Are you able to find it or not?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16923-0
01:31:40.619 --> 01:31:44.089
Are no, Sir, in announcement
also not able to find because.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16928-0
01:31:43.559 --> 01:31:47.019
I I just sent it on chat you
download from there.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16927-0
01:31:44.619 --> 01:31:44.889
Good.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16934-0
01:31:49.219 --> 01:31:50.119
Now you joined late.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16942-0
01:31:55.459 --> 01:31:56.789
Did you join the program late?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16957-0
01:31:58.999 --> 01:32:02.499
No, sorry, just for recap, I was
checking it as not available.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16964-0
01:32:02.509 --> 01:32:03.609
That's why most.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16970-0
01:32:04.809 --> 01:32:06.539
Hey you please answer my
question.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16974-0
01:32:06.549 --> 01:32:07.539
Did you join late?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16978-0
01:32:09.149 --> 01:32:09.599
No, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16986-0
01:32:11.049 --> 01:32:12.449
Not today's session, the
program.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/16997-0
01:32:13.249 --> 01:32:13.939
No, no, no.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17016-0
01:32:14.549 --> 01:32:19.787
I I joined from like, yeah, I
was just checking for lecture 0

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17004-0
01:32:14.629 --> 01:32:16.469
Then you know what every other,
every announcement.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17016-1
01:32:19.787 --> 01:32:20.379
slides.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17031-0
01:32:20.469 --> 01:32:22.969
It was not in the module
section, that's why.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17032-0
01:32:23.829 --> 01:32:24.959
OK, fine, fair enough.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17041-0
01:32:27.009 --> 01:32:27.899
Sir, one question.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17052-0
01:32:28.159 --> 01:32:28.539
Yeah, please.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17062-0
01:32:28.319 --> 01:32:31.619
So one of the topics in Chapter
2 is the basis change.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17069-0
01:32:32.349 --> 01:32:32.559
Hmm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17085-0
01:32:32.449 --> 01:32:36.003
Although I read the equations
and all like S inverse S all

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17085-1
01:32:36.003 --> 01:32:39.619
those things, but what's the
intuition behind basis change?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17093-0
01:32:39.689 --> 01:32:40.719
Is it like we are?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17118-0
01:32:40.729 --> 01:32:43.867
We have a matrix which is that's
saying canonical basis and we

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17118-1
01:32:43.867 --> 01:32:45.959
want to represent it in some
other basis.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17135-0
01:32:46.449 --> 01:32:47.869
So is it like there?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17128-0
01:32:46.489 --> 01:32:46.919
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17143-0
01:32:46.929 --> 01:32:50.406
For example, you did not depends
upon how you want to view

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17143-1
01:32:50.406 --> 01:32:50.819
things.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17150-0
01:32:51.249 --> 01:32:52.219
For example, right.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17149-0
01:32:51.859 --> 01:32:52.139
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17152-0
01:32:53.539 --> 01:32:54.499
Uh.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17156-0
01:32:54.929 --> 01:32:55.569
Can I write here?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17165-0
01:32:59.879 --> 01:33:02.819
So this is a normal basis,
right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17172-0
01:33:04.389 --> 01:33:05.169
Hmm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17176-0
01:33:05.459 --> 01:33:06.399
I get Jacob right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17177-0
01:33:05.559 --> 01:33:07.619
This is what?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17186-0
01:33:09.229 --> 01:33:10.939
Sorry, went into that physics
thing.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17199-0
01:33:10.949 --> 01:33:13.459
I kept JF01 and 10.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17223-0
01:33:13.469 --> 01:33:15.309
These become that normal basis
for R2.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17203-0
01:33:14.219 --> 01:33:14.589
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17218-0
01:33:14.599 --> 01:33:16.099
OK, so you this is your icab.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17229-0
01:33:16.109 --> 01:33:17.419
This is your J cab if you want.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17234-0
01:33:18.559 --> 01:33:18.739
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17246-0
01:33:18.819 --> 01:33:22.779
Now the point is you can
visualize the .5 comma 6 here.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17271-0
01:33:24.219 --> 01:33:27.529
Maybe 5 units here and then 6
units here not drawn to scale,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17256-0
01:33:24.529 --> 01:33:24.719
Yep.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17271-1
01:33:27.529 --> 01:33:29.429
but then this is what it is
right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17303-0
01:33:31.719 --> 01:33:36.229
Now the question is, should you
always view things with respect

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17279-0
01:33:32.139 --> 01:33:32.259
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17303-1
01:33:36.229 --> 01:33:40.529
to 1001 or is there a way by
which I have a basis like this?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17311-0
01:33:42.979 --> 01:33:43.819
This is also the basis.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17315-0
01:33:45.189 --> 01:33:45.329
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17330-0
01:33:46.339 --> 01:33:49.509
Any two set pepper of
intersecting lines in R2 will

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17330-1
01:33:49.509 --> 01:33:50.729
become basis, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17335-0
01:33:52.199 --> 01:33:52.489
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17347-0
01:33:53.119 --> 01:33:56.309
So in this is it easy for me to
view?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17365-0
01:33:56.759 --> 01:34:01.492
So I will have to write this 5-6
in terms of this basis vectors,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17365-1
01:34:01.492 --> 01:34:01.929
right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17369-0
01:34:05.459 --> 01:34:05.699
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17378-0
01:34:07.259 --> 01:34:09.099
So that is what is the change in
basis?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17382-0
01:34:12.249 --> 01:34:12.679
Got it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17434-0
01:34:12.729 --> 01:34:15.890
So it's like similar to
eigendecomposition where like P

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17434-1
01:34:15.890 --> 01:34:19.559
inverse will change the bit and
then we transform and then again

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17434-2
01:34:19.559 --> 01:34:23.229
we will repeat again change the
basis back to the initial basis.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17414-0
01:34:21.529 --> 01:34:21.859
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17419-0
01:34:21.869 --> 01:34:22.209
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17433-0
01:34:22.219 --> 01:34:23.969
That's what we're going to do
today, yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17437-0
01:34:24.979 --> 01:34:25.979
OK, got it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17473-0
01:34:27.059 --> 01:34:31.137
Because that specific part like
2.7 or some section is like very

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17473-1
01:34:31.137 --> 01:34:34.964
densely written and not very
explainable in that one T1 book

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17469-0
01:34:33.159 --> 01:34:33.339
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17473-2
01:34:34.964 --> 01:34:35.529
at least.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17496-0
01:34:35.539 --> 01:34:38.345
So I understood the equations
and all but that intuition I

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17496-1
01:34:38.345 --> 01:34:38.869
didn't get.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17492-0
01:34:39.649 --> 01:34:40.239
Ah, got it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17520-0
01:34:40.249 --> 01:34:44.503
So the the point is that you can
represent a point using any of

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17520-1
01:34:44.503 --> 01:34:48.159
the basis vectors, and the basis
is not unique, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17552-0
01:34:48.549 --> 01:34:52.277
You can have multiple traces for
the same vector space, so the

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17531-0
01:34:49.189 --> 01:34:49.349
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17552-1
01:34:52.277 --> 01:34:55.946
point is you can take one basis
which is quite comfortable to

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17553-0
01:34:52.899 --> 01:34:53.079
Right.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17552-2
01:34:55.946 --> 01:34:57.189
you and work with it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17558-0
01:34:59.769 --> 01:35:00.119
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17560-0
01:35:00.169 --> 01:35:00.819
Makes sense now.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17564-0
01:35:01.009 --> 01:35:01.329
Thank you.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17565-0
01:35:01.969 --> 01:35:02.329
Thank you.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17577-0
01:35:03.779 --> 01:35:06.689
For example, it is easy for me.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17583-0
01:35:07.499 --> 01:35:08.759
For example, let me take you.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17589-0
01:35:10.569 --> 01:35:14.119
2-3 and 3/3.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17600-0
01:35:16.229 --> 01:35:18.329
Is this a basis for R2?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17626-0
01:35:20.269 --> 01:35:23.629
Yes, they are not collinear, so
yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17622-0
01:35:21.519 --> 01:35:22.749
Is the basis for R2.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17638-0
01:35:23.059 --> 01:35:28.418
Now I will simply say that my
5-6 is basically nothing but 2/3

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17638-1
01:35:28.418 --> 01:35:28.929
times.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17650-0
01:35:29.619 --> 01:35:33.209
Yeah, 1 * 2 three plus 1 * 3
three correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17657-0
01:35:34.809 --> 01:35:34.959
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17685-0
01:35:35.669 --> 01:35:39.788
But if I have a line like 1-1
like this I I go one unit here

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17685-1
01:35:39.788 --> 01:35:42.759
and one unit here and this is my
.56 right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17689-0
01:35:44.029 --> 01:35:44.189
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17724-0
01:35:45.799 --> 01:35:50.177
Let us here I had to go 5 units
here and six units here so I can

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17724-1
01:35:50.177 --> 01:35:53.949
do my my, my coordinate system
in whichever way I want.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17732-0
01:35:55.039 --> 01:35:56.749
And workout in the new
coordinates.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17739-0
01:35:56.759 --> 01:35:57.749
That's what you used to do.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17752-0
01:35:57.759 --> 01:36:03.316
Now I don't know whether people
kill you with problems like this

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17752-1
01:36:03.316 --> 01:36:03.829
dress.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17765-0
01:36:06.409 --> 01:36:11.239
Raised by minus one equal to X
-, 2 whole square.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17771-0
01:36:11.769 --> 01:36:12.769
Did they give you these?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17776-0
01:36:12.779 --> 01:36:13.869
Kind of problems in school.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17802-0
01:36:16.989 --> 01:36:20.705
These are all we have seen, like
making projections and all, all

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17802-1
01:36:20.705 --> 01:36:21.449
those things.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17803-0
01:36:22.229 --> 01:36:22.839
No, no.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17806-0
01:36:22.989 --> 01:36:23.649
Did they give you?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17829-0
01:36:28.139 --> 01:36:30.880
So this is like a parabolic
equation, something like that,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17831-0
01:36:30.699 --> 01:36:32.669
That baby, did they ask you to
trace it?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17829-1
01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:31.159
right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17834-0
01:36:32.779 --> 01:36:33.529
Not name it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17845-0
01:36:36.639 --> 01:36:39.339
I mean I forgot the trace
operation.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17864-0
01:36:40.129 --> 01:36:43.549
No, no tracing is basically you
drop so maybe.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17856-0
01:36:40.339 --> 01:36:41.309
Don't exactly remember.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17862-0
01:36:43.609 --> 01:36:44.359
OK, huh.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17874-0
01:36:44.509 --> 01:36:45.959
Yeah, that that we have.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17898-0
01:36:46.179 --> 01:36:50.363
So what you did was you said let
why minus one be equal to

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17898-1
01:36:50.363 --> 01:36:53.839
capital Y and small X -, 2 B
equal to capital X?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17895-0
01:36:52.399 --> 01:36:52.599
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17916-0
01:36:54.609 --> 01:36:59.824
Now if this is your XY a plane
and then you went to XY,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17916-1
01:36:59.824 --> 01:37:00.569
correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17914-0
01:37:01.779 --> 01:37:02.189
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17918-0
01:37:02.199 --> 01:37:02.479
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17938-0
01:37:02.489 --> 01:37:04.539
Yeah, that origin change thing.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17941-0
01:37:03.009 --> 01:37:06.120
Because this is nothing but why
will be equal to X square

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17941-1
01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:06.549
correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17942-0
01:37:07.489 --> 01:37:07.689
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17946-0
01:37:10.069 --> 01:37:10.509
Agreeable.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17952-0
01:37:12.159 --> 01:37:12.519
Yes, yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17958-0
01:37:13.319 --> 01:37:15.729
So this this call is very easy
to trace.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17960-0
01:37:22.269 --> 01:37:22.479
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17962-0
01:37:24.859 --> 01:37:25.039
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17967-0
01:37:27.559 --> 01:37:28.049
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17985-0
01:37:28.059 --> 01:37:30.902
So you you know how to get back
to this using coordinate

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17985-1
01:37:30.902 --> 01:37:32.099
transformation, correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17987-0
01:37:33.169 --> 01:37:33.579
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17989-0
01:37:33.589 --> 01:37:34.049
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/17999-0
01:37:34.189 --> 01:37:36.579
That's shifting origin to X
comma each.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18000-0
01:37:36.659 --> 01:37:37.239
Yeah, correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18012-0
01:37:41.519 --> 01:37:42.929
Basically one comma 2 right.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18032-0
01:37:44.189 --> 01:37:46.019
Yes, in this case it would be
one come too.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18036-0
01:37:44.979 --> 01:37:48.499
Uh, like the two comma one that
is.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18043-0
01:37:47.589 --> 01:37:48.099
To come out.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18041-0
01:37:48.549 --> 01:37:48.829
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18047-0
01:37:48.839 --> 01:37:50.919
And that is what is the
argument.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18049-0
01:37:50.929 --> 01:37:51.329
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18054-0
01:37:51.339 --> 01:37:52.339
And the other is back now.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18072-0
01:37:55.239 --> 01:37:56.669
Yeah, that's clear.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18066-0
01:37:55.679 --> 01:37:55.779
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18073-0
01:37:55.879 --> 01:37:56.779
Yes, we're gonna start.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18074-0
01:37:57.949 --> 01:37:58.589
Can we start now?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18088-0
01:38:01.219 --> 01:38:01.349
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18083-0
01:38:01.449 --> 01:38:02.159
Uh, yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18090-0
01:38:01.959 --> 01:38:02.189
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18091-0
01:38:02.209 --> 01:38:02.869
Yes, Sir, we can.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18093-0
01:38:03.179 --> 01:38:03.509
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18100-0
01:38:04.509 --> 01:38:06.309
OK, so this is very simple.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18118-0
01:38:06.639 --> 01:38:12.380
Uh, you are given something like
and and they set of basis

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18118-1
01:38:12.380 --> 01:38:13.159
vectors.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18135-0
01:38:13.609 --> 01:38:16.267
Now you want to get into
something called as an

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18135-1
01:38:16.267 --> 01:38:17.209
orthogonal basis.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18149-0
01:38:18.479 --> 01:38:21.959
I hope the TS did one or two
problems and graph mid

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18149-1
01:38:21.959 --> 01:38:22.629
configure.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18163-0
01:38:22.639 --> 01:38:25.539
Can you confirm whether this is
the graph MITA has been done?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18177-0
01:38:26.869 --> 01:38:27.929
No, no.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18188-0
01:38:27.259 --> 01:38:29.539
No, Sir, I didn't touch this
topic since.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18179-0
01:38:29.439 --> 01:38:29.909
Speak.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18183-0
01:38:29.919 --> 01:38:30.859
OK, doesn't matter.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18190-0
01:38:30.869 --> 01:38:31.709
I will do it now.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18207-0
01:38:32.099 --> 01:38:34.549
So in ground Schmidt process,
what happens?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18227-0
01:38:34.559 --> 01:38:38.023
He will turn this given
orthogonal basis given normal

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18227-1
01:38:38.023 --> 01:38:41.039
basis to something called as
orthogonal basis.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18249-0
01:38:42.649 --> 01:38:47.255
So the way to do that is to
consider the something called a

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18249-1
01:38:47.255 --> 01:38:50.019
transpose A along with a
transpose.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18270-0
01:38:51.589 --> 01:38:57.829
So you are given a, in this case
IS3212, correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18289-0
01:38:59.419 --> 01:39:03.149
We have given 2 vectors V1 and
V2 or V1 and V2 after gonal.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18303-0
01:39:09.339 --> 01:39:10.799
It's our tonal basis, so yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18312-0
01:39:09.439 --> 01:39:09.619
No.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18306-0
01:39:12.109 --> 01:39:12.659
Why?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18308-0
01:39:12.799 --> 01:39:13.199
Why?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18319-0
01:39:13.269 --> 01:39:14.519
Hey, aren't the wonder list.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18342-0
01:39:13.809 --> 01:39:14.389
The.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18335-0
01:39:14.529 --> 01:39:17.761
If you take the dot product of
V1 and V2 you should get a 0,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18335-1
01:39:17.761 --> 01:39:18.079
right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18355-0
01:39:20.419 --> 01:39:21.209
Are you getting a zero?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18367-0
01:39:22.259 --> 01:39:23.779
No, Sir, no, no.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18375-0
01:39:22.309 --> 01:39:23.549
Are they orthogonal to each
other?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18372-0
01:39:22.679 --> 01:39:23.239
Yeah, yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18376-0
01:39:22.729 --> 01:39:23.749
So there's no problem.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18386-0
01:39:24.239 --> 01:39:25.359
No, no, we are not getting.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18388-0
01:39:25.759 --> 01:39:26.739
You're not getting it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18404-0
01:39:26.969 --> 01:39:30.513
So the question is, how do you
get into orthogonal basis from

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18404-1
01:39:30.513 --> 01:39:30.799
here?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18416-0
01:39:31.669 --> 01:39:35.659
So the the answer is provided by
something called as the.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18427-0
01:39:37.159 --> 01:39:39.009
Go see the designation process.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18443-0
01:39:39.019 --> 01:39:43.809
So what you do is you create an
augmented matrix with two parts.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18461-0
01:39:43.819 --> 01:39:46.559
The first part is air transpose
and the other part is a

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18461-1
01:39:46.559 --> 01:39:47.049
transpose.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18485-0
01:39:47.829 --> 01:39:52.971
So if you consider a transpose,
AA transpose is 10888 and a

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18485-1
01:39:52.971 --> 01:39:54.429
transpose IS3122.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18508-0
01:39:55.749 --> 01:40:02.218
Now you keep performing in this
Gaussian elimination business

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18508-1
01:40:02.218 --> 01:40:06.079
and you will get along the
diagonal.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18516-0
01:40:06.089 --> 01:40:09.299
For a transpose a something like
1-1 etcetera.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18528-0
01:40:10.579 --> 01:40:13.599
Now you look at the right side
of A transpose.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18548-0
01:40:13.609 --> 01:40:19.019
You will get a point 3.1 -, .25
and .75.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18573-0
01:40:20.139 --> 01:40:25.056
If you multiply the first
element .3 with minus .25 and

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18573-1
01:40:25.056 --> 01:40:29.359
add it to .1 into .75 are you
not getting zeros?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18577-0
01:40:31.559 --> 01:40:32.239
And what we yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18625-0
01:40:32.299 --> 01:40:33.039
You said that like.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18599-0
01:40:34.179 --> 01:40:38.769
So you have now converted it
into two orthogonal set.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18607-0
01:40:38.779 --> 01:40:40.359
So what is the 1st orthogonal 1?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18624-0
01:40:42.199 --> 01:40:46.849
Point 3.1 and minus .25 and .75
degree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18637-0
01:40:50.489 --> 01:40:51.049
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18636-0
01:40:50.609 --> 01:40:50.749
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18645-0
01:40:51.849 --> 01:40:54.359
But that is the orthogonal
orthogonal stuff.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18662-0
01:40:54.719 --> 01:40:57.997
You can now divide both the
vectors by their respective

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18662-1
01:40:57.997 --> 01:41:00.339
norms to get even the
orthonormal case.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18673-0
01:41:00.869 --> 01:41:03.419
Now, why do you think it is
always true?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18681-0
01:41:03.829 --> 01:41:06.219
This technique we have a small
justification.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18688-0
01:41:06.229 --> 01:41:07.749
I'm not going to do this.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18721-0
01:41:08.349 --> 01:41:13.102
Ohh for the reason that you know
any solution next to a X equal

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18721-1
01:41:13.102 --> 01:41:17.262
to 0 is also solution to a
transpose a X equal to 0 and

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18721-2
01:41:17.262 --> 01:41:18.079
vice versa.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18724-0
01:41:18.089 --> 01:41:20.529
I have already proved now.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18735-0
01:41:22.629 --> 01:41:24.439
That never A has full column
rank.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18742-0
01:41:24.449 --> 01:41:27.159
Then the matrix A transpose A is
positive.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18751-0
01:41:27.169 --> 01:41:29.989
Definitive why is a transpose a
positive definite?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18761-0
01:41:37.799 --> 01:41:39.629
And A has full column rank.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18775-0
01:41:39.639 --> 01:41:42.619
Why is amazing matrix A
transpose a positive definite?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18801-0
01:41:43.569 --> 01:41:47.811
Because dimension of that space
is 0 and so with our null matrix

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18801-1
01:41:47.811 --> 01:41:48.399
equation.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18812-0
01:41:48.699 --> 01:41:51.822
That is, that is for the second
part, but A transpose is

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18812-1
01:41:51.822 --> 01:41:52.809
positive definite.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18817-0
01:41:52.819 --> 01:41:53.759
You should prove that right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18844-0
01:41:56.189 --> 01:41:59.789
So a transpose A would be
symmetric, yeah?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18833-0
01:41:56.369 --> 01:41:58.129
Maybe determinant is greater
than 0?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18861-0
01:42:00.319 --> 01:42:05.913
Hey, in most in most things in
mathematics it just simply is

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18850-0
01:42:00.779 --> 01:42:01.229
You doing?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18861-1
01:42:05.913 --> 01:42:06.189
it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18869-0
01:42:06.249 --> 01:42:10.959
It follows the definition you
start with definition, so A has.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18876-0
01:42:12.579 --> 01:42:13.719
Full column rank right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18878-0
01:42:18.339 --> 01:42:18.639
Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18891-0
01:42:21.229 --> 01:42:21.559
Yes. Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18894-0
01:42:21.389 --> 01:42:22.329
It's written there, yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18906-0
01:42:22.519 --> 01:42:27.438
Now you have to prove that a
transpose A is positive

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18906-1
01:42:27.438 --> 01:42:29.109
definite. Correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18912-0
01:42:30.429 --> 01:42:30.639
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18917-0
01:42:30.729 --> 01:42:34.089
Now you consider how do you
prove positive definite?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18935-0
01:42:34.099 --> 01:42:37.612
You try say this is extra expose
a transpose A into X is more

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18935-1
01:42:37.612 --> 01:42:38.179
than zero.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18944-0
01:42:38.189 --> 01:42:39.229
This is what you have to prove,
right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18949-0
01:42:42.079 --> 01:42:42.279
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18954-0
01:42:42.689 --> 01:42:42.949
Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18981-0
01:42:44.099 --> 01:42:49.218
So this is the extra transpose,
A transpose, A X will be nothing

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18981-1
01:42:49.218 --> 01:42:53.943
but XAX transpose a transpose
into AX and writing it in two

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18981-2
01:42:53.943 --> 01:42:54.889
extra steps.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18997-0
01:42:54.899 --> 01:42:59.586
This is nothing but a X
transpose a X which is nothing

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/18997-1
01:42:59.586 --> 01:43:00.609
but norm of.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19010-0
01:43:02.339 --> 01:43:04.299
Our inner product I'll write one
more step.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19023-0
01:43:06.849 --> 01:43:08.969
He never duck eggs with eggs,
correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19028-0
01:43:10.119 --> 01:43:10.419
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19032-0
01:43:11.179 --> 01:43:13.849
This is normal AX4 square.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19042-0
01:43:15.819 --> 01:43:18.929
Right now, if you A has full
column rank.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19055-0
01:43:20.619 --> 01:43:24.649
What will belong to the to the
null space of a?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19075-0
01:43:27.199 --> 01:43:28.839
Only 00 vector.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19079-0
01:43:28.589 --> 01:43:29.069
Nothing.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19078-0
01:43:28.729 --> 01:43:29.139
Only zero.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19096-0
01:43:28.739 --> 01:43:33.741
One is 0, so when when I say
when X is not equal to 0, this

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19096-1
01:43:33.741 --> 01:43:37.159
quantity will be always
positive, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19100-0
01:43:38.169 --> 01:43:38.329
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19107-0
01:43:39.489 --> 01:43:39.849
It will.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19114-0
01:43:41.259 --> 01:43:43.539
Which means this is positive
definite. Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19119-0
01:43:46.099 --> 01:43:46.219
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19120-0
01:43:46.189 --> 01:43:46.389
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19123-0
01:43:46.819 --> 01:43:47.119
And yet.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19139-0
01:43:48.569 --> 01:43:53.219
And why is the condition then
that he has full column rank?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19154-0
01:43:53.339 --> 01:43:54.539
We did not account for that.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19150-0
01:43:53.539 --> 01:43:54.849
It is full column rank.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19180-0
01:43:54.889 --> 01:44:01.984
This will imply that AX equal to
zero will simply say that only 0

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19180-1
01:44:01.984 --> 01:44:05.639
belongs to the nullspace of
year.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19198-0
01:44:10.229 --> 01:44:13.559
That means X equal to zero will
always imply that X equal to 0.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19202-0
01:44:13.569 --> 01:44:14.709
So only solution agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19211-0
01:44:16.679 --> 01:44:19.289
So he has full column rank.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19230-0
01:44:19.339 --> 01:44:24.099
That implies that AX is equal to
0 will only be in the case of 0.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19231-0
01:44:23.959 --> 01:44:24.599
X = 0.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19236-0
01:44:25.429 --> 01:44:25.729
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19248-0
01:44:26.389 --> 01:44:27.919
Yeah, like, yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19241-0
01:44:27.169 --> 01:44:27.779
Exactly.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19255-0
01:44:27.829 --> 01:44:28.609
Exactly. Exactly.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19257-0
01:44:27.959 --> 01:44:29.199
The full full column rank.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19250-0
01:44:28.199 --> 01:44:29.009
But why?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19284-0
01:44:29.059 --> 01:44:33.596
Like but full column rank
definition like how that is

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19284-1
01:44:33.596 --> 01:44:38.049
inferred like how how to say it
is implied like the.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19296-0
01:44:38.939 --> 01:44:41.049
I mean full column rank as such.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19301-0
01:44:39.439 --> 01:44:40.439
He example to 0.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19304-0
01:44:41.119 --> 01:44:42.729
I mean, I had it for the first
time.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19308-0
01:44:44.009 --> 01:44:46.019
Ohh you see.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19325-0
01:44:56.819 --> 01:45:00.329
So let me give you some homework
and discuss next class.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19331-0
01:45:00.559 --> 01:45:02.609
You try to find what is row
rank.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19341-0
01:45:04.809 --> 01:45:07.309
You find something called column
rank.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19343-0
01:45:10.879 --> 01:45:11.199
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19361-0
01:45:15.819 --> 01:45:22.164
You can also prove that rank of
A is same as rank of a

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19361-1
01:45:22.164 --> 01:45:23.779
transpose. OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19371-0
01:45:27.389 --> 01:45:29.569
Mm-hmm. Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19407-0
01:45:28.349 --> 01:45:34.340
Body Now when something has a
full rank, so now this all these

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19407-1
01:45:34.340 --> 01:45:40.140
quantities are equal in there
Rahul and the column rank rank

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19407-2
01:45:40.140 --> 01:45:43.469
of rank of a transpose
equivalent.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19410-0
01:45:43.859 --> 01:45:44.609
But if you.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19414-0
01:45:45.249 --> 01:45:46.419
Now you can.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19422-0
01:45:46.469 --> 01:45:49.679
I have already told you that the
rank of a.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19447-0
01:45:51.099 --> 01:45:56.380
Plus dimension of null space of
A will be equal to number of

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19447-1
01:45:56.380 --> 01:45:58.199
columns of a correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19448-0
01:45:58.969 --> 01:45:59.309
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19457-0
01:46:01.539 --> 01:46:01.839
Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19456-0
01:46:01.709 --> 01:46:02.789
Mm-hmm. Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19471-0
01:46:02.969 --> 01:46:07.489
Now full column rank means this
and this quantity are same

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19471-1
01:46:07.489 --> 01:46:07.949
right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19483-0
01:46:13.769 --> 01:46:13.949
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19498-0
01:46:13.909 --> 01:46:16.999
So basically full column rank,
yeah, yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19491-0
01:46:13.939 --> 01:46:15.489
Yes, land coffee is.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19515-0
01:46:16.219 --> 01:46:20.078
So dimension of that space of a
will be equal to zero, which

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19515-1
01:46:20.078 --> 01:46:22.799
implies only 0 belongs to a null
space of.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19517-0
01:46:24.819 --> 01:46:25.279
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19520-0
01:46:27.339 --> 01:46:27.579
Right.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19521-0
01:46:28.379 --> 01:46:28.669
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19535-0
01:46:34.719 --> 01:46:38.019
OK, now I need to perform
something called.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19552-0
01:46:39.729 --> 01:46:43.956
This goes elimination, but for
Ghosh elimination I have certain

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19552-1
01:46:43.956 --> 01:46:44.419
things.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19564-0
01:46:44.429 --> 01:46:49.689
That's what I've given and I
think as a.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19574-0
01:46:52.119 --> 01:46:54.789
Uh, one of the problems to be
discussed?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19584-0
01:46:55.159 --> 01:46:56.849
I don't know whether it was
discussed or not.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19593-0
01:46:58.249 --> 01:47:01.119
Uh, but there is something
called Lu decomposition.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19615-0
01:47:01.129 --> 01:47:03.536
I don't know whether you guys
know or should I tell you

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19615-1
01:47:03.536 --> 01:47:04.869
briefly about Lu decomposition.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19625-0
01:47:05.649 --> 01:47:07.329
Please explain, Sir, it's not
discussed.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19628-0
01:47:07.769 --> 01:47:08.969
Yeah, it's not discussed.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19633-0
01:47:08.089 --> 01:47:08.349
Alright.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19636-0
01:47:08.979 --> 01:47:09.789
I'm not aware of that.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19839-0
01:47:09.049 --> 01:47:09.179
But.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19637-0
01:47:10.199 --> 01:47:10.599
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19676-0
01:47:12.989 --> 01:47:18.581
OK, now and, but if I give you
something like a X equal to

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19676-1
01:47:18.581 --> 01:47:24.553
B&amp;A is a square matrix of
size N cross N Now what you will

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19676-2
01:47:24.553 --> 01:47:26.639
do is you can do this.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19733-0
01:47:26.709 --> 01:47:31.856
This is what you're going to do
in the in the assignments, so

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19733-1
01:47:31.856 --> 01:47:37.087
you have something like A11A12
all the way up to A1N, and then

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19733-2
01:47:37.087 --> 01:47:42.317
there is a B1 and then you have
a N1A N 2 up to Anand and then

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19733-3
01:47:42.317 --> 01:47:42.899
the BN.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19746-0
01:47:43.809 --> 01:47:47.259
Now you start doing this
Gaussian elimination process.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19778-0
01:47:47.269 --> 01:47:51.699
Once you do the Gaussian
elimination process and then you

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19778-1
01:47:51.699 --> 01:47:56.664
know after some number of steps,
you will come to something like

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19778-2
01:47:56.664 --> 01:47:57.199
A11A12.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19809-0
01:47:57.209 --> 01:48:06.558
All they have to A1NB1 and then
you will do 0822 dash and so up

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19809-1
01:48:06.558 --> 01:48:09.919
to a 2N dash and so on.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19829-0
01:48:09.929 --> 01:48:16.319
The last one will be a NNN
dashes and this is PNN dashes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19834-0
01:48:17.359 --> 01:48:18.519
You will get something like
this.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19838-0
01:48:18.529 --> 01:48:19.139
You agree with me.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19844-0
01:48:22.219 --> 01:48:22.419
Yep.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19845-0
01:48:22.639 --> 01:48:22.759
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19858-0
01:48:23.919 --> 01:48:26.689
OK, now what is the advantage of
doing this?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19851-0
01:48:24.279 --> 01:48:24.389
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19873-0
01:48:26.699 --> 01:48:29.491
Gaussian elimination is that you
get from the last equation

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19873-1
01:48:29.491 --> 01:48:30.609
solution of XM, correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19878-0
01:48:33.969 --> 01:48:34.109
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19898-0
01:48:35.479 --> 01:48:38.251
From the previous one you get
the solution of X and minus one

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19891-0
01:48:35.889 --> 01:48:36.149
Angry.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19898-1
01:48:38.251 --> 01:48:38.699
and so on.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19919-0
01:48:38.709 --> 01:48:43.332
You'll get the X1, so this
process is called the forward

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19919-1
01:48:43.332 --> 01:48:48.361
elimination and this process is
called backward substitution.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19919-2
01:48:48.361 --> 01:48:48.929
Agreed.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19937-0
01:48:51.679 --> 01:48:51.909
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19934-0
01:48:51.739 --> 01:48:51.999
So.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19943-0
01:48:51.979 --> 01:48:52.529
Yeah, see.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19946-0
01:48:52.009 --> 01:48:52.939
So come again, come again.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19944-0
01:48:52.609 --> 01:48:52.799
Just.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19963-0
01:48:53.769 --> 01:48:57.942
This is the this process of
getting this EA to this form is

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19963-1
01:48:57.942 --> 01:49:00.099
called the forward elimination.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19972-0
01:49:00.169 --> 01:49:01.299
So you're keeping on you're.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19981-0
01:49:01.309 --> 01:49:04.969
You're eliminating all the all
the variables here, correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19994-0
01:49:09.539 --> 01:49:09.689
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/19999-0
01:49:09.579 --> 01:49:10.739
OK, OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20015-0
01:49:09.599 --> 01:49:14.008
And this this way of getting XN,
then X n -, 1 and all the way up

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20015-1
01:49:14.008 --> 01:49:14.409
to X1.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20023-0
01:49:14.419 --> 01:49:15.959
This is called the back
substitution, correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20029-0
01:49:16.879 --> 01:49:17.199
But it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20031-0
01:49:17.109 --> 01:49:18.389
Because it's substituting from
the back.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20033-0
01:49:20.169 --> 01:49:20.329
Right.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20035-0
01:49:21.969 --> 01:49:22.289
Pardon.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20040-0
01:49:24.289 --> 01:49:24.629
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20062-0
01:49:25.579 --> 01:49:29.660
Now, since you are all done the
DSD course, I will just write

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20062-1
01:49:29.660 --> 01:49:30.779
the order needed.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20083-0
01:49:31.009 --> 01:49:34.222
The forward elimination will
have will eat up something like

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20083-1
01:49:34.222 --> 01:49:36.909
2 by three NQ order of two by
three NQ operations.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20090-0
01:49:39.379 --> 01:49:40.889
And the backward substitution
will.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20101-0
01:49:43.059 --> 01:49:46.679
Will involve order of N square
operations.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20105-0
01:49:49.779 --> 01:49:50.239
Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20111-0
01:49:53.359 --> 01:49:53.849
I just.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20116-0
01:49:53.859 --> 01:49:54.559
I'm not getting.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20141-0
01:49:56.809 --> 01:49:59.349
Order of two to two by three and
Cube.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20142-0
01:49:58.849 --> 01:50:01.129
Hey, you are you are you doing
the DSD course or not?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20153-0
01:50:04.349 --> 01:50:04.559
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20159-0
01:50:05.729 --> 01:50:07.449
Yesterday this is covered seven
days.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20157-0
01:50:06.109 --> 01:50:06.279
So.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20176-0
01:50:09.179 --> 01:50:10.939
Or the other two by three and
two.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20179-0
01:50:09.799 --> 01:50:10.979
It is covered or not covered.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20202-0
01:50:12.919 --> 01:50:15.949
It is covered, Sir, with
example.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20191-0
01:50:13.049 --> 01:50:13.519
Or don't look.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20196-0
01:50:13.469 --> 01:50:15.019
This yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20195-0
01:50:14.749 --> 01:50:14.929
So.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20204-0
01:50:17.189 --> 01:50:18.209
Should I do this part?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20221-0
01:50:20.469 --> 01:50:25.589
Next N that is, that is that is
that I understood.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20234-0
01:50:25.999 --> 01:50:30.109
When kisser that the left hand
side, two by three and three.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20240-0
01:50:30.119 --> 01:50:31.889
I'm just trying to understand.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20257-0
01:50:31.899 --> 01:50:35.799
Yeah, that, that part how it is
coming to a three and three.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20280-0
01:50:37.009 --> 01:50:43.771
It is not, uh, this is a result
I'm stating the proof is little

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20280-1
01:50:43.771 --> 01:50:45.039
a intricate.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20291-0
01:50:45.049 --> 01:50:46.459
I will explain the steps to you.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20295-0
01:50:46.469 --> 01:50:47.149
You can prove it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20297-0
01:50:48.519 --> 01:50:48.739
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20312-0
01:50:49.429 --> 01:50:49.729
And.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20309-0
01:50:51.259 --> 01:50:52.699
Can you give us an example, Sir?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20346-0
01:50:54.289 --> 01:50:56.429
In the example, I will not be
able to prove NQ.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20358-0
01:50:54.829 --> 01:50:57.439
Right hand side and then
getting.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20337-0
01:50:55.219 --> 01:50:56.189
Explained it a little.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20360-0
01:50:56.439 --> 01:50:57.739
The order of two by three NQ.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20352-0
01:50:56.579 --> 01:50:56.989
No, no.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20364-0
01:50:56.999 --> 01:50:59.209
Just just, yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20370-0
01:50:58.589 --> 01:50:59.479
What I'm saying is.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20387-0
01:50:59.219 --> 01:51:02.839
Just explain how we will get N3
this scenario.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20391-0
01:51:02.049 --> 01:51:03.959
I can give you the that that
thing.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20388-0
01:51:02.409 --> 01:51:02.629
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20400-0
01:51:04.349 --> 01:51:07.069
Now let's say that you want to
make this guy 0.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20406-0
01:51:09.759 --> 01:51:10.559
What did you leave?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20412-0
01:51:10.569 --> 01:51:11.409
What was there is.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20420-0
01:51:11.419 --> 01:51:13.689
Yeah, to one element was there.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20431-0
01:51:13.699 --> 01:51:16.109
Now you want to make the TA21 as
zero.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20439-0
01:51:16.279 --> 01:51:17.939
So what is the operation you'll
use?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20452-0
01:51:21.749 --> 01:51:23.849
A21 into some constant of A1.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20456-0
01:51:24.589 --> 01:51:24.859
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20493-0
01:51:25.179 --> 01:51:33.089
Ohh R2 boost 2R2 minus yeah to
one by A11R1.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20482-0
01:51:29.029 --> 01:51:30.919
R2 minus Cos.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20485-0
01:51:29.109 --> 01:51:31.449
Minus A1821.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20491-0
01:51:34.209 --> 01:51:34.669
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20494-0
01:51:34.549 --> 01:51:34.889
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20496-0
01:51:34.679 --> 01:51:35.229
Yeah, yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20509-0
01:51:36.649 --> 01:51:37.309
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20513-0
01:51:36.969 --> 01:51:40.089
Now if you allow me, I will make
a small change here.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20514-0
01:51:42.019 --> 01:51:42.169
And.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20547-0
01:51:44.179 --> 01:51:44.489
Phone.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20546-0
01:51:44.389 --> 01:51:50.651
Can I make a small change object
was too hard J -, a J, one for J

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20533-0
01:51:46.949 --> 01:51:47.129
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20540-0
01:51:48.029 --> 01:51:48.989
Yeah, you can generate.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20546-1
01:51:50.651 --> 01:51:52.359
equal to two to N?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20553-0
01:51:55.749 --> 01:51:55.969
Like.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20560-0
01:51:57.189 --> 01:51:58.889
This is make all these guys
zeros.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20563-0
01:52:01.079 --> 01:52:01.259
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20570-0
01:52:04.079 --> 01:52:06.519
Hey, OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20572-0
01:52:04.849 --> 01:52:05.129
Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20576-0
01:52:06.529 --> 01:52:06.929
Yes, yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20584-0
01:52:07.739 --> 01:52:10.349
OK, but now you have to do this
operation.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20636-0
01:52:10.359 --> 01:52:17.892
Very cleverly, what will happen
is if I take the J throw detro

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20636-1
01:52:17.892 --> 01:52:25.306
for some J which is between 2:00
and then what I will do is I

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20636-2
01:52:25.306 --> 01:52:31.524
will keep my factor in a
variable called M which is

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20636-3
01:52:31.524 --> 01:52:33.199
nothing but a.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20643-0
01:52:34.179 --> 01:52:36.349
Jay, one by A11.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20669-0
01:52:38.349 --> 01:52:43.679
So in that row what I will do is
I will just do RJ going to R, J

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20669-1
01:52:43.679 --> 01:52:45.319
-, M * R One agreed.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20674-0
01:52:47.959 --> 01:52:48.509
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20676-0
01:52:49.379 --> 01:52:49.499
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20707-0
01:52:50.109 --> 01:52:54.978
OK, so uh, when I do this, my
daughter count is based on

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20707-1
01:52:54.978 --> 01:53:00.446
number of divisions I do number
of multiplications I do and the

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20707-2
01:53:00.446 --> 01:53:03.009
number of additions I correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20715-0
01:53:05.839 --> 01:53:06.159
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20723-0
01:53:07.069 --> 01:53:09.419
Now these additions will also
include subtractions.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20727-0
01:53:10.749 --> 01:53:11.719
What does name OK?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20735-0
01:53:15.499 --> 01:53:15.619
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20747-0
01:53:16.739 --> 01:53:20.945
So if you take the 2nd row, tell
me how many operations will I

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20747-1
01:53:20.945 --> 01:53:21.279
make?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20760-0
01:53:27.249 --> 01:53:29.439
How many divisions will I do for
the first second row?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20763-0
01:53:32.269 --> 01:53:32.429
And.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20777-0
01:53:33.969 --> 01:53:34.319
Yen.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20781-0
01:53:34.039 --> 01:53:36.259
How many divisions will they do
for the 2nd row?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20780-0
01:53:34.489 --> 01:53:34.669
Only.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20805-0
01:53:36.269 --> 01:53:40.609
I'm storing in the M this
variable called a J1 by A11.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20802-0
01:53:38.089 --> 01:53:39.369
Or whatever.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20811-0
01:53:42.089 --> 01:53:42.289
1.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20815-0
01:53:42.479 --> 01:53:42.859
Yeah, one.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20818-0
01:53:43.449 --> 01:53:45.289
So only one for the 2nd row,
correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20823-0
01:53:47.739 --> 01:53:47.859
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20835-0
01:53:48.959 --> 01:53:52.269
And how many additions do you
see for every element?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20845-0
01:53:52.329 --> 01:53:56.845
I am using one multiplication
here and one addition here

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20845-1
01:53:56.845 --> 01:53:57.479
correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20848-0
01:54:00.299 --> 01:54:00.429
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20878-0
01:54:02.319 --> 01:54:05.162
I will not, once I do this, I
will not calculate this element

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20878-1
01:54:05.162 --> 01:54:07.868
because this will automatically
become zero because of the

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20878-2
01:54:07.868 --> 01:54:08.969
transformation, correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20886-0
01:54:12.049 --> 01:54:12.469
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20890-0
01:54:12.659 --> 01:54:13.329
Better correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20891-0
01:54:13.059 --> 01:54:13.599
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20896-0
01:54:13.939 --> 01:54:16.569
So I will have how many elements
here.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20924-0
01:54:24.019 --> 01:54:25.769
In Minnesota, 10 -? 1.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20935-0
01:54:24.239 --> 01:54:26.489
N -, 1 N minus one.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20927-0
01:54:24.949 --> 01:54:25.269
Thank you.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20929-0
01:54:25.099 --> 01:54:25.829
And then this one.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20944-0
01:54:26.199 --> 01:54:28.709
Hey, just think about it, Bubba.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20938-0
01:54:27.389 --> 01:54:27.709
And.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20952-0
01:54:29.669 --> 01:54:30.219
N.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20958-0
01:54:29.839 --> 01:54:31.029
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20984-0
01:54:31.519 --> 01:54:36.591
The end elements I'll be having
N elements I'll be having, so I

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20965-0
01:54:32.129 --> 01:54:32.989
Yeah, yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20984-1
01:54:36.591 --> 01:54:40.474
will be using yeah
multiplications and additions

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20984-2
01:54:40.474 --> 01:54:41.029
agreed.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/20987-0
01:54:42.329 --> 01:54:42.639
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21003-0
01:54:43.689 --> 01:54:49.309
OK, now the same thing happens
in all these rows, correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21010-0
01:54:50.829 --> 01:54:51.169
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21012-0

01:54:52.109 --> 01:54:53.189
So how many of those have been?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21016-0
01:54:53.929 --> 01:54:54.119
And.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21027-0

Bye. Bye you.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21066-0
01:55:01.819 --> 01:55:03.069
Please will you do it for this?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21062-0
01:55:01.929 --> 01:55:02.489
Minus one.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21077-0
01:55:04.429 --> 01:55:04.949
Minus one.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21078-0
01:55:04.469 --> 01:55:05.339
The minus one.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21080-0
01:55:04.809 --> 01:55:06.109
Lauren and minus one.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21081-0
01:55:05.629 --> 01:55:06.399
M -, 1.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21108-0
01:55:07.849 --> 01:55:11.992
So again, minus one divisions
are there N into n -, 1

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21108-1
01:55:11.992 --> 01:55:16.289
multiplication N into n -, 1
additions are there agree?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21111-0
01:55:17.439 --> 01:55:17.819
Agreed.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21113-0
01:55:17.769 --> 01:55:18.279
Be.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21133-0
01:55:19.719 --> 01:55:25.529
You come to the Cathro, then you
will find n -, K no.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21137-0
01:55:27.169 --> 01:55:29.629
He he minus one.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21143-0
01:55:30.849 --> 01:55:32.059
How many were in the K?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21148-0
01:55:32.069 --> 01:55:32.849
Through how many money?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21151-0
01:55:33.199 --> 01:55:33.539
How many?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21158-0
01:55:34.169 --> 01:55:37.049
Ohh divisions will you use?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21164-0
01:55:38.499 --> 01:55:39.249
And minus Q.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21172-0
01:55:40.069 --> 01:55:40.729
And minus.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21184-0
01:55:41.539 --> 01:55:41.969
And minus.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21200-0
01:55:42.089 --> 01:55:44.439
And minus K, -, 1 and minus K,
-, 1.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21191-0
01:55:42.999 --> 01:55:43.169
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21201-0
01:55:43.459 --> 01:55:44.409
In ministry.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21223-0
01:55:44.949 --> 01:55:48.869
N -, 1, -, K, -, 1, -, K.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21215-0
01:55:45.789 --> 01:55:46.499
Yeah, minus.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21221-0
01:55:47.409 --> 01:55:48.209
A -, 1.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21227-0
01:55:49.029 --> 01:55:49.719
K -, 1.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21233-0
01:55:50.679 --> 01:55:51.199
And and.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21235-0
01:55:51.299 --> 01:55:52.729
And minus K -, 1.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21246-0
01:55:52.939 --> 01:55:56.429
This is n -, K N minus K + 1.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21267-0
01:55:57.059 --> 01:56:01.239
Then this is n -, K N minus K +
1.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21272-0
01:55:59.649 --> 01:56:02.309
Here and minus Q my plus one.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21284-0
01:56:03.209 --> 01:56:06.739
So this also if you want you can
try n -, K +, 1.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21292-0
01:56:07.129 --> 01:56:08.579
Now this is a total thing.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21317-0
01:56:08.889 --> 01:56:15.819
Now to get the total number of
divisions, it is simply Sigma K

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21317-1
01:56:15.819 --> 01:56:20.329
equal to 1 to north minus one n
-, K uh.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21356-0
01:56:20.519 --> 01:56:25.738
This will be the total number of
divisions, then number of

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21356-1
01:56:25.738 --> 01:56:31.046
additions would be equal to K
equal to 1 to north minus One

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21356-2
01:56:31.046 --> 01:56:35.469
North minus one into n -, K + 1,
and then n -, K.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21369-0
01:56:37.389 --> 01:56:39.299
And this is much this is
divisions.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21371-0
01:56:39.749 --> 01:56:41.279
This is multiplications.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21381-0
01:56:41.449 --> 01:56:43.559
Additions is same as
multiplications.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21400-0
01:56:44.149 --> 01:56:48.139
If you Add all the two, I will
tell you where you are going to

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21400-1
01:56:48.139 --> 01:56:48.899
get this KQ.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21411-0
01:56:49.359 --> 01:56:53.039
Now the leading term will be N
into NN square, correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21421-0
01:56:58.639 --> 01:56:58.909
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21419-0
01:56:58.779 --> 01:56:59.009
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21422-0
01:56:58.809 --> 01:56:58.959
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21429-0
01:56:59.439 --> 01:57:00.039
Yes, yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21430-0
01:57:00.089 --> 01:57:00.439
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21435-0
01:57:00.219 --> 01:57:00.729
Open.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21432-0
01:57:00.319 --> 01:57:00.739
There's a.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21481-0
01:57:01.079 --> 01:57:06.555
So this time is negligible
compared to the N square term,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21450-0
01:57:04.509 --> 01:57:04.719
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21481-1
01:57:06.555 --> 01:57:12.691
so the leading term leading town
will be nothing but two Sigma K

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21481-2
01:57:12.691 --> 01:57:17.979
equal to 1 to n -, 1, N minus
KN, two n -, K + 1 agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21495-0
01:57:18.189 --> 01:57:20.371
Why the two is because
multiplications additions are

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21493-0
01:57:18.649 --> 01:57:18.859
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21495-1
01:57:20.371 --> 01:57:20.619
there.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21501-0
01:57:21.589 --> 01:57:21.859
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21525-0
01:57:22.879 --> 01:57:26.430
OK, now without getting into the
depth of it, you will get a term

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21513-0
01:57:24.039 --> 01:57:24.199
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21522-0
01:57:25.569 --> 01:57:25.819
Ohh.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21525-1
01:57:26.430 --> 01:57:28.099
called Sigma N square, correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21528-0
01:57:29.099 --> 01:57:29.239
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21550-0
01:57:30.369 --> 01:57:36.862
Sigma inspired is nothing but
yen into n + 1 into two N + 1 by

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21550-1
01:57:36.862 --> 01:57:37.069
6.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21554-0
01:57:39.089 --> 01:57:39.389
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21558-0
01:57:39.619 --> 01:57:39.819
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21561-0
01:57:40.189 --> 01:57:40.419
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21602-0
01:57:41.219 --> 01:57:45.271
Of course you have to substitute
here N with n -, 1, because some

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21601-0
01:57:43.229 --> 01:57:43.439
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21602-1
01:57:45.271 --> 01:57:49.323
goes only up to North minus one,
so this will turn to North minus

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21602-2
01:57:49.323 --> 01:57:52.209
one into N into 2 N minus 2 + 1
by 6, correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21625-0
01:57:53.829 --> 01:57:54.279
That's great.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21627-0
01:57:55.119 --> 01:57:56.469
And there is a 2 here.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21634-0
01:57:55.319 --> 01:57:56.039
And this is a new.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21636-0
01:57:55.399 --> 01:57:55.959
He soon.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21641-0
01:57:56.719 --> 01:57:57.999
So what is the leading term
here?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21647-0
01:57:58.979 --> 01:57:59.319
Thank you.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21658-0
01:57:59.289 --> 01:58:01.779
Yen, Yen, ¥2, two.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21651-0
01:58:00.379 --> 01:58:01.099
And cube.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21657-0
01:58:02.519 --> 01:58:02.889
Thank you.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21667-0
01:58:03.269 --> 01:58:06.739
So 2 into N into N into 2 N by
6.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21677-0
01:58:07.049 --> 01:58:08.739
This is nothing but two by three
N 3.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21684-0
01:58:10.389 --> 01:58:11.629
Perfect. Great.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21698-0
01:58:12.909 --> 01:58:17.132
So this is the algorithm is of
the order of two by three and

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21698-1
01:58:17.132 --> 01:58:17.479
cube.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21708-0
01:58:18.999 --> 01:58:22.589
OK, now this is for the forward
elimination.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21724-0
01:58:22.879 --> 01:58:25.398
Now for the backward
substitution, you'll find this

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21724-1
01:58:25.398 --> 01:58:26.609
to be order of elsewhere.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21733-0
01:58:27.079 --> 01:58:28.349
You can do it in a similar way.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21736-0
01:58:28.359 --> 01:58:29.969
OK, so they do that.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21758-0
01:58:32.319 --> 01:58:33.379
And no, Sir, we'll do it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21770-0
01:58:33.439 --> 01:58:34.159
You already showed.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21762-0
01:58:33.469 --> 01:58:34.179
It's OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21769-0
01:58:33.489 --> 01:58:34.319
No, it's OK. Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21766-0
01:58:33.839 --> 01:58:34.179
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21764-0
01:58:34.509 --> 01:58:35.039
It's fine.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21775-0
01:58:35.049 --> 01:58:35.709
Yeah, this is.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21772-0
01:58:35.069 --> 01:58:35.839
OK, fine.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21785-0
01:58:36.389 --> 01:58:39.199
So I will just give you an order
of magnitude.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21811-0
01:58:39.209 --> 01:58:45.086
So if you take an yen as 10,000,
then the forward elimination

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21811-1
01:58:45.086 --> 01:58:51.059
will will take 11 minutes and
the backward substitution to be.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21822-0
01:58:53.199 --> 01:58:57.499
0.1 second Upper Navy right.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21821-0
01:58:57.129 --> 01:58:57.309
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21827-0
01:59:03.079 --> 01:59:03.259
So.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21828-0
01:59:03.519 --> 01:59:03.789
Speak.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21836-0
01:59:06.639 --> 01:59:08.149
It's something like this. Don't.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21862-0
01:59:08.799 --> 01:59:12.219
So I don't know whether it is .1
or something like it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21866-0
01:59:09.209 --> 01:59:11.349
It said, sorry Sir, I couldn't
unmute.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21874-0
01:59:12.519 --> 01:59:14.399
Yeah, you can verify from our.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21876-0
01:59:13.779 --> 01:59:14.229
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21882-0
01:59:14.239 --> 01:59:17.279
.1 point to one only, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21890-0
01:59:17.289 --> 01:59:17.709
Correct, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21897-0
01:59:18.319 --> 01:59:19.689
0.1 seconds.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21895-0
01:59:19.799 --> 01:59:20.349
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21931-0
01:59:20.119 --> 01:59:24.207
OK, now you see, for any equal
to 10,000 of forward elimination

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21902-0
01:59:20.359 --> 01:59:20.619
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21931-1
01:59:24.207 --> 01:59:27.657
takes less 7 minutes and the
backward substitution .1

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21931-2
01:59:27.657 --> 01:59:28.169
seconds.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21946-0
01:59:28.359 --> 01:59:32.976
So totally the algorithm will
take something like 11 minutes

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21946-1
01:59:32.976 --> 01:59:33.809
.1 seconds.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21955-0
01:59:34.019 --> 01:59:36.449
I can approximate it to 11
minutes. Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21959-0
01:59:38.219 --> 01:59:38.569
Agreed.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21963-0
01:59:38.749 --> 01:59:38.939
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21967-0
01:59:39.199 --> 01:59:39.719
You said.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21972-0
01:59:40.679 --> 01:59:42.269
This is the Super fast machine.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21996-0
01:59:42.539 --> 01:59:46.543
It does 10 to the power of 9
computations in one second super

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/21996-1
01:59:46.543 --> 01:59:49.579
machine and it does it this
problem at 10,000.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22040-0
01:59:49.589 --> 01:59:54.548
Better so you will have your
what you've solved is a 10,000

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22040-1
01:59:54.548 --> 01:59:59.507
by 10,000 * X equal to V This
problem you have solved using

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22040-2
01:59:59.507 --> 02:00:04.301
Gaussian elimination in 11
minutes in this past computer.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22040-3
02:00:04.301 --> 02:00:04.549
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22045-0
02:00:06.949 --> 02:00:07.249
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22052-0
02:00:08.329 --> 02:00:09.659
OK, now the problem comes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22061-0
02:00:09.669 --> 02:00:11.539
The problem statement is
something like this.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22070-0
02:00:11.629 --> 02:00:13.879
You have for the same A.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22113-0
02:00:13.889 --> 02:00:21.230
You have 25 problems, AX1 equal
to B1AX2, equal to B2 and a X25

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22113-1
02:00:21.230 --> 02:00:28.226
equal to B-25, and you've been
asked to solve all these 2525

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22113-2
02:00:28.226 --> 02:00:29.259
problems.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22130-0
02:00:29.709 --> 02:00:32.192
You don't have any parallel
architecture or parallel

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22130-1
02:00:32.192 --> 02:00:32.989
machines running.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22145-0
02:00:32.999 --> 02:00:35.825
You have a single machine and
you have to run all these

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22145-1
02:00:35.825 --> 02:00:36.179
things.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22154-0
02:00:36.249 --> 02:00:38.109
So this will take 11 minutes
approximately.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22160-0
02:00:38.159 --> 02:00:38.579
Me.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22164-0
02:00:38.929 --> 02:00:40.099
This will take 11 minutes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22171-0
02:00:40.109 --> 02:00:41.089
This will take 11 minutes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22175-0
02:00:42.379 --> 02:00:43.209
What is total time?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22191-0
02:00:46.039 --> 02:00:47.009
275.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22192-0
02:00:46.709 --> 02:00:47.479
75.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22200-0
02:00:47.649 --> 02:00:48.709
What do you?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22196-0
02:00:48.049 --> 02:00:48.799
Minutes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22209-0
02:00:49.319 --> 02:00:49.699
Put the.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22198-0
02:00:49.349 --> 02:00:49.759
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22212-0
02:00:49.769 --> 02:00:51.839
Something like 4 1/2 hours,
something like that.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22214-0
02:00:51.849 --> 02:00:52.389
It will take right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22221-0
02:00:55.889 --> 02:00:56.229
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22244-0
02:00:56.849 --> 02:01:00.505
OK, now I am going to give you
item other method by which you

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22244-1
02:01:00.505 --> 02:01:03.219
can do it in much less time
compared to this.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22252-0
02:01:03.229 --> 02:01:05.339
So I want to achieve
computational flexibility.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22258-0
02:01:05.669 --> 02:01:06.219
What is that?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22266-0
02:01:06.229 --> 02:01:08.569
It is called something called as
Lu decomposition.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22278-0
02:01:12.019 --> 02:01:13.989
What is the LED composition? You
write?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22292-0
02:01:13.999 --> 02:01:18.089
A matrix A as the L into U,
where L is lower triangular.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22299-0
02:01:20.569 --> 02:01:21.989
And you is upper triangular.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22301-0
02:01:25.189 --> 02:01:25.489
Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22306-0
02:01:27.139 --> 02:01:27.459
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22332-0
02:01:28.449 --> 02:01:31.928
Now if you ask me, can every
matrix written like Lu it is not

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22332-1
02:01:31.928 --> 02:01:34.959
possible, but I'm going to come
to that little later.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22347-0
02:01:34.969 --> 02:01:40.019
But you give me some time for me
to explain this in in detail.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22373-0
02:01:40.369 --> 02:01:44.534
So suppose you have written a as
well into U, where L is lower

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22373-1
02:01:44.534 --> 02:01:47.179
triangular, L is U is upper
triangular.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22396-0
02:01:47.429 --> 02:01:52.182
Basically what it says is you
can do this in order of two by

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22396-1
02:01:52.182 --> 02:01:54.909
three and cubed operations.
Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22403-0
02:01:57.819 --> 02:01:58.039
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22421-0
02:01:58.959 --> 02:02:04.057
Yell will occupy order of NQ by
three and you will take order of

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22421-1
02:02:04.057 --> 02:02:04.999
NQ by three.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22427-0
02:02:06.579 --> 02:02:06.879
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22449-0
02:02:08.009 --> 02:02:11.991
So, but in total of 2 by 3 N
cube you'll be able to decompose

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22449-1
02:02:11.991 --> 02:02:13.019
ASL into U once.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22452-0
02:02:13.029 --> 02:02:13.359
So why?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22460-0
02:02:13.369 --> 02:02:14.699
Why are we doing all these
things?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22471-0
02:02:14.869 --> 02:02:17.279
We are interested in solving a X
equal to B.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22489-0
02:02:17.709 --> 02:02:21.322
Now you have written ASL, so
this is nothing but LUX equal to

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22489-1
02:02:21.322 --> 02:02:21.439
B.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22508-0
02:02:21.909 --> 02:02:28.052
Now let me put UX to be equal to
Y which will give me LY equal to

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22508-1
02:02:28.052 --> 02:02:28.239
B.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22512-0
02:02:31.029 --> 02:02:31.349
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22526-0
02:02:32.949 --> 02:02:37.039
Now this lower triangular matrix
into Y will be equal to B.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22533-0
02:02:37.049 --> 02:02:38.119
It will be something like this.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22542-0
02:02:38.769 --> 02:02:41.149
You will have there.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22549-0
02:02:41.159 --> 02:02:42.459
There are elements here.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22556-0
02:02:42.669 --> 02:02:44.589
I will write it in terms of L
itself.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22559-0
02:02:50.099 --> 02:02:50.559
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22571-0
02:02:50.599 --> 02:02:52.979
Do you know umm different?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22586-0
02:02:51.929 --> 02:02:59.489
L 1100000 L 21, L 2200000,
etcetera.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22604-0
02:02:59.499 --> 02:03:02.986
Then there is a L and 1L and two
two all the way up to Ln,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22604-1
02:03:02.986 --> 02:03:03.459
correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22610-0
02:03:06.029 --> 02:03:06.339
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22608-0
02:03:06.929 --> 02:03:07.319
Times.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22611-0
02:03:07.329 --> 02:03:07.859
Why?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22621-0
02:03:08.189 --> 02:03:10.039
Why 1Y2 up to YN?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22632-0
02:03:11.179 --> 02:03:13.969
This will be nothing but B1B2 up
to BN, correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22643-0
02:03:16.589 --> 02:03:16.769
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22650-0
02:03:17.189 --> 02:03:20.318
Now is it not similar to the
back substitution we did some

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22650-1
02:03:20.318 --> 02:03:20.849
time back?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22666-0
02:03:24.289 --> 02:03:25.829
Yes it is.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22662-0
02:03:24.819 --> 02:03:25.359
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22672-0
02:03:25.939 --> 02:03:28.699
So this will take order of North
Square computations.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22684-0
02:03:32.729 --> 02:03:32.969
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22696-0
02:03:32.919 --> 02:03:34.449
Yeah, every.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22692-0
02:03:33.389 --> 02:03:33.929
You said.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22701-0
02:03:33.899 --> 02:03:37.081
OK, now in order of North Square
computations, I'll get something

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22699-0
02:03:34.819 --> 02:03:35.629
Why didn't you?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22701-1
02:03:37.081 --> 02:03:37.419
called.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22703-0
02:03:37.429 --> 02:03:37.989
Why correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22710-0
02:03:41.399 --> 02:03:41.649
We just.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22712-0
02:03:41.859 --> 02:03:41.989
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22716-0
02:03:42.769 --> 02:03:42.889
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22722-0
02:03:42.789 --> 02:03:46.019
Now I will have you Y equal to
B.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22743-0
02:03:46.329 --> 02:03:50.296
This is also the similar thing,
so I will spend the order of N

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22743-1
02:03:50.296 --> 02:03:52.059
square to get my uh are you?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22749-0
02:03:55.009 --> 02:03:57.279
UX equal to but.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22756-0
02:03:59.219 --> 02:04:00.079
X equal to Y.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22760-0
02:04:02.129 --> 02:04:02.609
And to get.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22793-0
02:04:04.339 --> 02:04:10.010
X So what I'm saying is, if you
have a X equal to B, suppose

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22793-1
02:04:10.010 --> 02:04:14.009
you're able to write it as LUX
equal to B.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22798-0
02:04:14.329 --> 02:04:15.739
You can get X.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22812-0
02:04:16.609 --> 02:04:19.139
What are the things you need to
get eggs?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22845-0
02:04:19.409 --> 02:04:24.848
You need Lu which is order of
two by three NQ you need why

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22845-1
02:04:24.848 --> 02:04:30.380
which is an order of N square
and you need X which is again

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22845-2
02:04:30.380 --> 02:04:32.409
order of N ^2 correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22848-0
02:04:37.899 --> 02:04:38.199
So.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22851-0
02:04:39.659 --> 02:04:40.049
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22884-0
02:04:40.059 --> 02:04:48.319
So again, I will go to a AX1
equal to B1AX2 equal to B2 up to

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22884-1
02:04:48.319 --> 02:04:53.249
a XNE equal to B AX25 equal to
B-25.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22894-0
02:04:54.259 --> 02:04:57.009
Now for this how much I time
will be spent.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22911-0
02:05:01.319 --> 02:05:06.629
Yeah, you 10,000 cross 10,000
now the Lu part.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22927-0
02:05:07.479 --> 02:05:10.609
We'll take how much time here in
the AX1 equal to B1.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22937-0
02:05:10.759 --> 02:05:12.739
I told you this order of two by
three NQ.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22958-0
02:05:16.389 --> 02:05:18.229
So level.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22957-0
02:05:17.119 --> 02:05:17.649
11 minutes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22962-0
02:05:18.489 --> 02:05:19.479
Even 11 minute.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22967-0
02:05:18.629 --> 02:05:21.029
It just they got it
approximately 11 minutes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22970-0
02:05:22.139 --> 02:05:22.329
No.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22979-0
02:05:23.759 --> 02:05:26.789
Will 11 minutes be able to solve
this?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22983-0
02:05:26.799 --> 02:05:27.229
No.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22991-0
02:05:27.299 --> 02:05:30.949
I need my why and then only
from?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/22997-0
02:05:31.079 --> 02:05:32.249
Why I'll get X right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23016-0
02:05:32.519 --> 02:05:35.466
So I will take a .1 second here
and another .1 second here,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23016-1
02:05:35.466 --> 02:05:35.859
correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23019-0
02:05:37.109 --> 02:05:37.339
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23030-0
02:05:38.899 --> 02:05:40.329
OK, now come to a X2.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23032-0
02:05:39.369 --> 02:05:39.749
There's that.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23033-0
02:05:39.769 --> 02:05:40.149
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23034-0
02:05:40.339 --> 02:05:40.959
Equal to yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23043-0
02:05:43.629 --> 02:05:45.199
Somebody 8/2 equal to B2.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23050-0
02:05:45.209 --> 02:05:46.569
How much time will it require?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23054-0
02:05:47.909 --> 02:05:48.229
Same.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23073-0
02:05:49.089 --> 02:05:52.349
No, I have already composed ASL
into you.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23070-0
02:05:50.449 --> 02:05:50.889
I'll tell you.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23079-0
02:05:52.299 --> 02:05:52.719
Yeah, yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23082-0
02:05:52.389 --> 02:05:53.849
Why will I decompose again here?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23088-0
02:05:54.799 --> 02:05:55.099
Alright.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23097-0
02:05:55.979 --> 02:05:58.519
I will spend .1 seconds and .1
seconds only.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23105-0
02:06:00.419 --> 02:06:01.919
Well, ABHINAY.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23119-0
02:06:03.379 --> 02:06:06.329
And point once against here .1
seconds here.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23140-0
02:06:06.639 --> 02:06:13.605
So total time spent by me is 111
minutes plus 25 * 0.2 seconds

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23140-1
02:06:13.605 --> 02:06:14.269
agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23142-0
02:06:16.399 --> 02:06:16.539
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23153-0
02:06:18.599 --> 02:06:20.769
Which is again close to 11
minutes only, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23157-0
02:06:23.809 --> 02:06:24.009
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23203-0
02:06:25.249 --> 02:06:28.137
So what is reduction in Lu
decomposition is I have

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23169-0
02:06:26.579 --> 02:06:26.909
Really.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23203-1
02:06:28.137 --> 02:06:31.309
decomposed a into L&amp;U so
that I am able to solve 25

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23203-2
02:06:31.309 --> 02:06:34.707
systems in about 11 minutes
whereas using Gauss elimination

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23203-3
02:06:34.707 --> 02:06:37.369
I would have spent something
like 275 minutes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23204-0
02:06:37.049 --> 02:06:37.289
But.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23206-0
02:06:41.169 --> 02:06:41.369
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23213-0
02:06:43.359 --> 02:06:43.659
Said.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23219-0
02:06:43.529 --> 02:06:43.879
Pardon.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23225-0
02:06:43.669 --> 02:06:45.689
But this is a different X.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23239-0
02:06:45.699 --> 02:06:48.635
The different X and different B
so different competition may be

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23239-1
02:06:48.635 --> 02:06:49.369
required, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23254-0
02:06:49.379 --> 02:06:50.889
So which of the same?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23246-0
02:06:49.779 --> 02:06:50.469
Yeah, correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23267-0
02:06:50.479 --> 02:06:55.553
I'm so there are problems where
my A is a constant only the the

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23267-1
02:06:55.553 --> 02:06:57.219
the B's are changing.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23318-0
02:07:01.089 --> 02:07:05.165
So the first step only is taking
the much time because we are

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23318-1
02:07:05.165 --> 02:07:09.504
decomposing the metric there and
after that it's like every other

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23326-0
02:07:09.219 --> 02:07:12.483
Yeah, the first adding compost
and store it store L and you in

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23318-2
02:07:09.504 --> 02:07:11.279
metric will take less time.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23340-0
02:07:11.449 --> 02:07:14.529
Yeah, yes, yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23326-1
02:07:12.483 --> 02:07:13.209
your computer.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23341-0
02:07:13.459 --> 02:07:15.909
Once you store LNU there for the
others it's a breeze.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23365-0
02:07:16.259 --> 02:07:18.927
You just spent point 1.1 you get
the answer, you get .1 point and

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23365-1
02:07:18.927 --> 02:07:20.019
you get the answer correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23373-0
02:07:21.489 --> 02:07:21.909
Yes, yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23378-0
02:07:22.849 --> 02:07:24.359
This is the restaurant
technique.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23402-0
02:07:24.429 --> 02:07:27.940
If you go to any restaurant,
they will have one niece called

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23402-1
02:07:27.940 --> 02:07:30.589
this Dania sauce and there is a
tomato sauce.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23404-0
02:07:30.599 --> 02:07:30.989
You know this.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23413-0
02:07:34.209 --> 02:07:34.789
You don't know this.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23415-0
02:07:35.639 --> 02:07:36.329
Just yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23431-0
02:07:38.019 --> 02:07:39.539
Yeah, you know this or you don't
know this.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23443-0
02:07:40.539 --> 02:07:41.119
Yes, you know.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23451-0
02:07:41.359 --> 02:07:42.059
I know that I know.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23462-0
02:07:41.699 --> 02:07:44.479
You mean to say that they will
just add anything in?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23448-0
02:07:41.779 --> 02:07:43.299
You said no, no.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23470-0
02:07:43.479 --> 02:07:45.019
Sir, no, this just.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23473-0
02:07:45.169 --> 02:07:45.699
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23478-0
02:07:45.789 --> 02:07:46.939
You name any?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23476-0
02:07:45.989 --> 02:07:47.109
They will be having this.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23484-0
02:07:47.119 --> 02:07:47.869
They will just add.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23482-0
02:07:47.409 --> 02:07:48.029
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23500-0
02:07:48.529 --> 02:07:51.444
So that is actually generating
set for the North Indian

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23495-0
02:07:49.929 --> 02:07:50.069
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23500-1
02:07:51.444 --> 02:07:52.069
restaurants.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23521-0
02:07:53.059 --> 02:07:55.079
If you go to South Indian
restaurants, they will have

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23517-0
02:07:54.219 --> 02:07:54.339
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23521-1
02:07:55.079 --> 02:07:56.389
something called those are
better.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23529-0
02:07:56.479 --> 02:07:57.829
You ask idly, they'll put in.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23544-0
02:07:57.839 --> 02:07:59.419
Italy play day you ask for dosa.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23579-0
02:07:59.429 --> 02:08:02.490
They'll put in Dosa tava you ask
for mutava, they'll put some

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23579-1
02:08:02.490 --> 02:08:05.157
onion on top of it, but
everything is coming from the

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23579-2
02:08:05.157 --> 02:08:05.849
same team now.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23597-0
02:08:05.859 --> 02:08:08.933
Just because you order those are
they're not going to soak rice,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23591-0
02:08:06.079 --> 02:08:06.469
I.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23590-0
02:08:06.169 --> 02:08:06.629
Yes, yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23597-1
02:08:08.933 --> 02:08:09.879
urid, Dal, etcetera.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23615-0
02:08:09.889 --> 02:08:13.225
It is already prepared, so
that's the reason why things are

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23615-1
02:08:13.225 --> 02:08:14.949
able to be generated very fast.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23628-0
02:08:14.959 --> 02:08:17.699
L is something that you already
grind.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23636-0
02:08:17.769 --> 02:08:19.129
All these and keep it ready.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23647-0
02:08:20.259 --> 02:08:22.849
And then now you start using it
again and again.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23645-0
02:08:20.849 --> 02:08:20.979
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23656-0
02:08:22.919 --> 02:08:26.009
OK, now that's a power.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23664-0
02:08:26.259 --> 02:08:28.819
Now based on can I continue
here?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23697-0
02:08:30.369 --> 02:08:34.250
Said only one confusions, so
this X equal to B that

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23711-0
02:08:32.349 --> 02:08:32.579
Uh.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23697-1
02:08:34.250 --> 02:08:38.579
A&amp;X&amp;B will not be same
for all the problem right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23702-0
02:08:38.589 --> 02:08:39.599
It might be different, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23706-0
02:08:39.609 --> 02:08:39.759
So.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23730-0
02:08:40.289 --> 02:08:43.719
So then how that 11 minutes is
equal across all this?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23731-0
02:08:42.199 --> 02:08:44.189
Ohh I I I never I never.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23737-0
02:08:44.299 --> 02:08:46.189
I marketed for different
product.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23781-0
02:08:46.459 --> 02:08:53.090
If you have a 1X1 E equal to
B1A2X2 equal to B2 and A25X25

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23781-1
02:08:53.090 --> 02:08:59.946
equal to B-25 where all the A's
are different, then you will

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23781-2
02:08:59.946 --> 02:09:01.969
spend 275 minutes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23788-0
02:09:02.029 --> 02:09:02.309
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23789-0
02:09:02.069 --> 02:09:03.209
There is no doubt about it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23797-0
02:09:05.489 --> 02:09:05.609
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23795-0
02:09:05.859 --> 02:09:06.409
Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23833-0
02:09:06.679 --> 02:09:11.334
But I am talking about a
different problem where my AX1

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23833-1
02:09:11.334 --> 02:09:16.572
equal to B1AX2 equal to B2 up to
AX 25 equal to B-25 where all

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23833-2
02:09:16.572 --> 02:09:18.069
the A's are saved.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23835-0
02:09:23.669 --> 02:09:23.989
Agreed.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23843-0
02:09:26.239 --> 02:09:26.599
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23852-0
02:09:27.759 --> 02:09:30.119
Here I can do this entire
problem in 11 minutes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23860-0
02:09:30.129 --> 02:09:30.989
That's what is middling.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23862-0
02:09:37.609 --> 02:09:37.889
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23869-0
02:09:40.189 --> 02:09:40.909
Yes, Sir, I agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23884-0
02:09:41.629 --> 02:09:47.169
OK, now there is a general
theorem which says if A is.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23898-0
02:09:47.579 --> 02:09:54.025
If A is symmetric and positive
definite, then you can do Lu

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23898-1
02:09:54.025 --> 02:09:55.529
decomposition.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23905-0
02:10:00.339 --> 02:10:01.179
OK, this is a theorem.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23916-0
02:10:03.769 --> 02:10:05.349
Eva is symmetric and positive.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23921-0
02:10:05.359 --> 02:10:08.039
Then the Lu decomposition is
possible now.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23953-0
02:10:09.849 --> 02:10:12.732
If you want a understand in
terms of elementary matrices,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23953-1
02:10:12.732 --> 02:10:15.864
you can also do it in terms of
elementary matrices, which I'll

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23953-2
02:10:15.864 --> 02:10:16.859
do in a in a minute.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23963-0
02:10:17.659 --> 02:10:19.129
But what are these L&amp;U?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23993-0
02:10:19.179 --> 02:10:25.098
You can take the form of L to be
all diagonals to be one, and

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/23993-1
02:10:25.098 --> 02:10:30.349
then you have L21L1 etcetera to
L, n -, n N minus one.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24033-0
02:10:30.799 --> 02:10:38.101
This is under 0 here and you to
be and all you want one you want

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24033-1
02:10:38.101 --> 02:10:44.729
to up to you one N then zero U22
up to you 2N00 up to UNN.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24044-0
02:10:45.479 --> 02:10:47.189
You can also have this as this.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24053-0
02:10:47.199 --> 02:10:49.199
This is the called the
doolittles method.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24081-0
02:10:54.779 --> 02:10:58.431
So you're writing something
because we are still still see

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24070-0
02:10:56.739 --> 02:10:57.449
I'm writing.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24080-0
02:10:57.459 --> 02:10:58.299
You're not able to see that.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24081-1
02:10:58.431 --> 02:10:58.989
the same.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24126-0
02:11:01.459 --> 02:11:04.439
So we can see your writing
actually don't see.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24103-0
02:11:01.479 --> 02:11:01.989
See you soon.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24113-0
02:11:02.849 --> 02:11:03.269
So currently.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24116-0
02:11:02.969 --> 02:11:03.869
We can see your ID.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24141-0
02:11:04.039 --> 02:11:06.769
But they can use their issue
with the.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24134-0
02:11:04.359 --> 02:11:07.029
OK, OK, do this is called
doolittles.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24137-0
02:11:05.499 --> 02:11:06.019
I can see.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24721-0
02:11:07.159 --> 02:11:07.339
The.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24164-0
02:11:07.219 --> 02:11:10.389
OK, but this is called
doolittles because this will

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24164-1
02:11:10.389 --> 02:11:12.829
have all ones in the diagonal
for Yelp.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24174-0
02:11:13.319 --> 02:11:16.709
Now you can have something
called as scouts method.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24242-0
02:11:20.379 --> 02:11:26.734
Where the diagonal in the yell
once will get passed on to you,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24242-1
02:11:26.734 --> 02:11:32.484
so yell will have in general
L11, then 0000, then L21, L

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24242-2
02:11:32.484 --> 02:11:38.840
220000 and all the way up to L
and in one L and to all the way

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24242-3
02:11:38.840 --> 02:11:39.849
up to LNN.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24270-0
02:11:40.239 --> 02:11:43.660
This is yell and the you will be
nothing, but you'll have once

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24270-1
02:11:43.660 --> 02:11:46.159
along the diagonal, so this will
all be once.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24280-0
02:11:47.449 --> 02:11:49.609
This is a big zero and you have
elements here.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24286-0
02:11:50.629 --> 02:11:51.989
This is called crowds method.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24293-0
02:11:51.999 --> 02:11:53.649
There is something called
cholesky's method.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24347-0
02:11:56.619 --> 02:12:01.707
The Cholesky's method is all
about getting a ask, yell, yell,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24347-1
02:12:01.707 --> 02:12:07.042
transpose, or you transpose you
so you have, uh, yell equal to U

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24347-2
02:12:07.042 --> 02:12:12.213
transpose one is a transpose of
the other, so this is the case

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24347-3
02:12:12.213 --> 02:12:16.399
where you have something called
cholesky's method.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24358-0
02:12:16.409 --> 02:12:18.489
This is what I have written down
in one slide.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24360-0
02:12:20.109 --> 02:12:21.189
OK now.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24374-0
02:12:23.919 --> 02:12:26.469
Yeah, we have done some
cholesky's decomposition.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24382-0
02:12:26.479 --> 02:12:28.389
Now for uh, matrix into yell.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24387-0
02:12:28.399 --> 02:12:29.929
Yell, transpose, etcetera.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24397-0
02:12:29.939 --> 02:12:31.809
We have got all these things
fixed.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24405-0
02:12:32.789 --> 02:12:35.289
OK, now you ask me when?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24410-0
02:12:35.989 --> 02:12:38.639
Channel uh living here?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24412-0
02:12:38.649 --> 02:12:38.999
Go on.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24421-0
02:12:41.389 --> 02:12:42.939
I mean, that's something
different.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24423-0
02:12:43.279 --> 02:12:43.439
What?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24426-0
02:12:44.049 --> 02:12:44.839
About something.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24435-0
02:12:46.989 --> 02:12:48.419
Somebody trying to say something
to me.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24460-0
02:12:53.039 --> 02:12:56.774
OK, now the question is what
will happen to the Gauss

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24460-1
02:12:56.774 --> 02:13:00.509
elimination for each of the
steps for a given matrix?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24470-0
02:13:01.619 --> 02:13:03.879
As long as you are able to
generate.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24475-0
02:13:06.379 --> 02:13:07.539
Generate the matrix.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24484-0
02:13:07.549 --> 02:13:09.829
Uh, the the the lower triangular
form.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24514-0
02:13:11.049 --> 02:13:14.840
Uh, on the upper triangular
form, without interchanging rows

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24514-1
02:13:14.840 --> 02:13:18.819
in all those cases you will be
able to do the Lu decomposition.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24529-0
02:13:19.719 --> 02:13:25.214
Now each elementary row
operation OK for example, I will

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24529-1
02:13:25.214 --> 02:13:25.889
get no.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24533-0
02:13:25.929 --> 02:13:26.709
OK, fine.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24622-0
02:13:26.989 --> 02:13:31.751
So for example, if I have a a,
if I have a Member A to one

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24622-1
02:13:31.751 --> 02:13:36.513
which I have to make 0 using
A11, what I will do is I will

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24622-2
02:13:36.513 --> 02:13:41.033
take something called as an
elementary matrix E so this

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24622-3
02:13:41.033 --> 02:13:45.795
elementary matrix EI will add
this factor called minus two

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24622-4
02:13:45.795 --> 02:13:50.557
here and leave the one and zeros
unaltered except for this

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24622-5
02:13:50.557 --> 02:13:54.109
position because I want to make
this a 210.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24646-0
02:13:55.069 --> 02:14:01.062
Now the elementary row operation
of subtracting 2 times the first

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24646-1
02:14:01.062 --> 02:14:05.603
row is accomplished by
multiplying this with this

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24646-2
02:14:05.603 --> 02:14:06.239
matrix.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24658-0
02:14:06.349 --> 02:14:09.459
That minus two will be will come
here now.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24676-0
02:14:09.469 --> 02:14:12.223
Once that minus two comes here,
you will get a zero

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24676-1
02:14:12.223 --> 02:14:13.919
automatically when you when you.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24695-0
02:14:13.929 --> 02:14:17.319
When you do this, you are able
to see this A2 1 -, 2 A1.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24704-0
02:14:17.329 --> 02:14:20.389
One is a two 1 -, 2 A1 exactly
be equal to 0.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24714-0
02:14:22.389 --> 02:14:23.339
You get my point?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24720-0
02:14:23.529 --> 02:14:24.629
Or should I work out an example?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24730-0
02:14:27.749 --> 02:14:28.799
Example please Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24732-0
02:14:29.339 --> 02:14:30.489
Example please.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24739-0
02:14:32.019 --> 02:14:34.119
Now let me just do this example.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24760-0
02:14:36.259 --> 02:14:42.569
I want to write so there is a
1223.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24768-0
02:14:43.839 --> 02:14:47.409
OK, now I want to make it upper
triangular.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24772-0
02:14:50.309 --> 02:14:51.219
Upper triangle.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24777-0
02:14:51.539 --> 02:14:52.259
Now what do I do?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24786-0
02:14:54.209 --> 02:14:55.599
Both in elimination, what will
they do?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24812-0
02:14:59.049 --> 02:15:02.509
Will I not do R2 goes to R 2 -,
2, R one?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24811-0
02:14:59.319 --> 02:15:01.819
R 2 -, 2, R one.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24817-0
02:15:02.909 --> 02:15:03.189
What?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24832-0
02:15:04.379 --> 02:15:06.949
OK, if I do R 2 -, 2, R one,
what do I get?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24845-0
02:15:06.999 --> 02:15:10.659
122 minus two is zero, 3 -, 4 is
minus 1. Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24851-0
02:15:10.129 --> 02:15:13.089
Yeah, yeah, I know.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24870-0
02:15:14.159 --> 02:15:16.039
With all this, you remember
that? Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24867-0
02:15:15.159 --> 02:15:15.299
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24868-0
02:15:15.249 --> 02:15:15.549
Buddy.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24869-0
02:15:15.289 --> 02:15:15.839
Creation.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24876-0
02:15:20.719 --> 02:15:21.289
Did you get it?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24884-0
02:15:23.339 --> 02:15:23.759
Yes, yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24886-0
02:15:23.799 --> 02:15:24.159
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24942-0
02:15:24.189 --> 02:15:24.409
Teams.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24900-0
02:15:24.929 --> 02:15:29.499
OK, now what I do is I will take
one elementary matrix.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24909-0
02:15:29.509 --> 02:15:30.569
What is elementary matrix?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24913-0
02:15:30.579 --> 02:15:31.579
You take the same.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24941-0
02:15:32.729 --> 02:15:36.976
I need the metrics and why
wherever this minus 2R1 is there

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24941-1
02:15:36.976 --> 02:15:39.949
you substitute this place is the
minus 2.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24945-0
02:15:41.789 --> 02:15:42.339
Good.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24951-0
02:15:42.409 --> 02:15:43.999
Please go on mute.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24950-0
02:15:43.209 --> 02:15:43.729
'Cause.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24965-0
02:15:47.429 --> 02:15:50.626
You substitute this entry with
the minus two which is coming

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24965-1
02:15:50.626 --> 02:15:50.889
here.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24969-0
02:15:51.889 --> 02:15:52.439
Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24980-0
02:15:53.009 --> 02:15:56.889
If you do that, you call this a
SE1.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24995-0
02:15:57.059 --> 02:16:00.249
Now you multiply E1 with a 1223.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/24999-0
02:16:00.679 --> 02:16:01.739
You tell me what you get.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25012-0
02:16:03.639 --> 02:16:04.649
Three, how you got even.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25022-0
02:16:05.809 --> 02:16:06.199
Hey.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25023-0
02:16:06.089 --> 02:16:07.839
Even I told you, now you take
the you take the.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25027-0
02:16:10.689 --> 02:16:11.279
You take.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25048-0
02:16:13.919 --> 02:16:17.782
You take the identity matrix,
you see what element you are

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25048-1
02:16:17.782 --> 02:16:19.419
using here and which row.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25058-0
02:16:19.429 --> 02:16:22.239
This is row two and there is a
-, 2.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25063-0
02:16:22.249 --> 02:16:23.849
So you put a -, 2 here.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25117-0
02:16:28.159 --> 02:16:33.410
If you multiply these two
matrices, you check what you get

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25117-1
02:16:33.410 --> 02:16:38.840
10 into 1/2 is 1, right 1023 is
2 -, 2 one into 120, correct

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25103-0
02:16:35.449 --> 02:16:35.679
2.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25110-0
02:16:38.169 --> 02:16:38.449
0.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25117-2
02:16:38.840 --> 02:16:41.689
minus 21 into this is minus one.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25140-0
02:16:44.779 --> 02:16:47.680
So the effect of doing this is
actually multiplying it,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25140-1
02:16:47.680 --> 02:16:50.219
something called as an
elementary matrix. Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25146-0
02:16:51.959 --> 02:16:52.059
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25154-0
02:16:52.509 --> 02:16:52.859
It's.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25164-0
02:16:53.099 --> 02:16:54.219
OK so.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25158-0
02:16:53.609 --> 02:16:54.839
So what's the case?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25163-0
02:16:53.949 --> 02:16:54.099
And.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25169-0
02:16:54.849 --> 02:16:55.989
If it is 3 by three matrix.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25175-0
02:16:56.979 --> 02:16:58.439
Same thing, same principle.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25183-0
02:16:58.449 --> 02:16:59.569
Will be only holds. Nah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25184-0
02:17:00.529 --> 02:17:00.839
It's yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25207-0
02:17:04.449 --> 02:17:10.259
The same thing only holds it so
123456789.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25235-0
02:17:10.799 --> 02:17:15.970
So in the first case, you want
to make this guy 0, so you'll

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25235-1
02:17:15.970 --> 02:17:18.599
say R2 goes to R 2 -, 4, R one.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25259-0
02:17:18.849 --> 02:17:24.477
In the next case, So what is the
elementary matrix corresponding

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25259-1
02:17:24.477 --> 02:17:26.989
to that 100010 and 001 right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25277-0
02:17:29.329 --> 02:17:31.839
And this is second row and this
is the minus four.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25276-0
02:17:29.659 --> 02:17:29.899
Right.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25291-0
02:17:31.849 --> 02:17:34.809
So you make the change this
number to minus 4, correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25294-0
02:17:36.139 --> 02:17:36.399
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25298-0
02:17:36.719 --> 02:17:36.959
If.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25313-0
02:17:38.109 --> 02:17:42.579
What is next operation R3 goes
to R 3 -, 7, R one.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25319-0
02:17:42.629 --> 02:17:44.319
So what is elementary matrix?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25333-0
02:17:44.369 --> 02:17:51.589
This is 100010 minus 701.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25345-0
02:17:51.659 --> 02:17:55.129
Agree this will be called E one.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25342-0
02:17:52.929 --> 02:17:53.139
Mm-hmm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25351-0
02:17:55.139 --> 02:17:56.239
This will be called E2.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25373-0
02:17:56.449 --> 02:17:59.946
So what you do is you take your
original matrix A first, you

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25373-1
02:17:59.946 --> 02:18:02.239
multiply with E1, then multiply
with E.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25379-0
02:18:04.829 --> 02:18:05.129
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25404-0
02:18:06.149 --> 02:18:14.900
Now, if you do now and for
example I have a matrix AN cross

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25404-1
02:18:14.900 --> 02:18:18.839
NI will do E1E2E3 etcetera.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25436-0
02:18:18.849 --> 02:18:24.433
So I will do some operations now
at the end of it, let's say I do

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25424-0
02:18:21.049 --> 02:18:21.379
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25436-1
02:18:24.433 --> 02:18:27.649
some, we end dash kind of
operations.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25444-0
02:18:28.059 --> 02:18:29.459
What will I be left with?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25450-0
02:18:30.649 --> 02:18:31.559
What would be the end product?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25472-0
02:18:35.279 --> 02:18:36.399
Upper triangular matrix.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25474-0
02:18:35.519 --> 02:18:36.599
An upper triangle matrix.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25482-0
02:18:37.019 --> 02:18:37.999
Upper triangular matrix.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25475-0
02:18:37.069 --> 02:18:37.899
Fantastic.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25491-0
02:18:38.129 --> 02:18:40.988
OK, so this is going to be
called an upper triangular

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25491-1
02:18:40.988 --> 02:18:41.359
matrix.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25508-0
02:18:42.949 --> 02:18:47.699
Do you find E1E2E N dash to all
the lower triangular?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25516-0
02:18:50.049 --> 02:18:50.699
You should.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25518-0
02:18:51.189 --> 02:18:51.529
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25532-0
02:18:52.529 --> 02:18:56.139
So even E2 up to EN, they're all
lower triangular.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25542-0
02:18:56.209 --> 02:19:01.299
Now if you take E1, EI and EJ.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25567-0
02:19:02.089 --> 02:19:10.095
Are lower triangular then NEGI
times E JRE J times EEI comma EI

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25567-1
02:19:10.095 --> 02:19:14.349
dot EJ are also lower
triangular.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25587-0
02:19:17.999 --> 02:19:21.422
Agreed, the product of 2 lower
triangular matrix is again lower

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25587-1
02:19:21.422 --> 02:19:22.759
triangular matrix, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25588-0
02:19:23.549 --> 02:19:23.809
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25589-0
02:19:23.709 --> 02:19:23.879
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25591-0
02:19:27.519 --> 02:19:27.679
So.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25615-0
02:19:30.139 --> 02:19:38.124
I will be able to write E and
dash all the way up to eat 2 dot

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25615-1
02:19:38.124 --> 02:19:40.279
E1A E equal to U.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25636-0
02:19:41.749 --> 02:19:47.239
This I will write as L inverse
the inverse of a lower triangle

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25636-1
02:19:47.239 --> 02:19:47.849
matrix.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25639-0
02:19:47.859 --> 02:19:49.169
Also lower triangle correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25652-0
02:19:55.429 --> 02:19:55.789
This.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25655-0
02:19:55.759 --> 02:19:56.239
He is.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25682-0
02:19:56.739 --> 02:20:00.767
So could you please go up a
little bit just just to just

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25661-0
02:19:57.909 --> 02:19:58.239
So this.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25669-0
02:20:00.059 --> 02:20:00.359
Meaning.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25682-1
02:20:00.767 --> 02:20:04.159
quit, just scroll up please,
just to make sure.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25689-0
02:20:03.529 --> 02:20:05.879
Scroll up OK ah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25690-0
02:20:04.649 --> 02:20:06.129
Yeah, yeah, yeah, one little
bit.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25714-0
02:20:08.419 --> 02:20:12.695
So the the even E2E3 are the are
obviously and lower triangular

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25714-1
02:20:12.695 --> 02:20:14.499
matrix you're saying right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25719-0
02:20:14.039 --> 02:20:15.139
Yeah, yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25727-0
02:20:15.709 --> 02:20:18.189
So we have made them as a lower
triangular matrix.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25731-0
02:20:18.759 --> 02:20:18.989
No.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25732-0
02:20:19.929 --> 02:20:20.629
OK. OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25735-0
02:20:20.859 --> 02:20:21.199
Thank you.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25777-0
02:20:23.039 --> 02:20:25.626
So I'm taking the product of Rd
triangular to be lower

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25777-1
02:20:25.626 --> 02:20:28.213
triangular, but I'm writing it
as the inverse of lower

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25777-2
02:20:28.213 --> 02:20:31.223
triangular because the inverse
of a lower triangle made is also

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25777-3
02:20:31.223 --> 02:20:31.929
lower triangle.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25803-0
02:20:33.329 --> 02:20:36.946
So I'm getting yelled transpose
a inverse A will be equal to U

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25803-1
02:20:36.946 --> 02:20:38.899
which will give me a equal to
Lu.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25807-0
02:20:42.229 --> 02:20:42.469
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25808-0
02:20:42.549 --> 02:20:43.579
Right, right.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25821-0
02:20:51.029 --> 02:20:55.679
But not all matrices will have
Lu decomposition.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25844-0
02:20:56.259 --> 02:21:01.234
Now you need to have symmetric
and positive definite, so this

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25844-1
02:21:01.234 --> 02:21:02.839
is 1 trick you said.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25850-0
02:21:02.849 --> 02:21:05.059
Given any matrix, AN cross N.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25875-0
02:21:05.649 --> 02:21:09.018
Now you cannot say whether this
is going to be symmetric or not,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25875-1
02:21:09.018 --> 02:21:11.869
but I can always move to
something called a transpose.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25882-0
02:21:11.879 --> 02:21:13.919
A is a transpose asymmetric.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25887-0
02:21:16.749 --> 02:21:16.909
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25892-0
02:21:18.209 --> 02:21:19.499
A transpose A.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25914-0
02:21:19.509 --> 02:21:22.037
The whole transpose will be
equal to a transpose, A

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25914-1
02:21:22.037 --> 02:21:24.809
transpose, a whole transpose is
nothing but a transpose.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25937-0
02:21:24.819 --> 02:21:29.956
A correct which in place air
transpose a symmetric easier

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25929-0
02:21:27.389 --> 02:21:27.549
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25935-0
02:21:28.499 --> 02:21:28.799
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25937-1
02:21:29.956 --> 02:21:31.019
transpose A.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25942-0
02:21:31.969 --> 02:21:32.839
Boost your definite.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25953-0
02:21:34.699 --> 02:21:34.869
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25969-0
02:21:35.499 --> 02:21:36.799
Yes, we proved it all.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25961-0
02:21:36.019 --> 02:21:36.129
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25975-0
02:21:36.439 --> 02:21:39.549
Yes, I already proved that air
transpose is possible.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25963-0
02:21:36.879 --> 02:21:37.169
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25965-0
02:21:37.179 --> 02:21:37.869
Yeah, both.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/25977-0
02:21:37.879 --> 02:21:38.159
That's, yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26015-0
02:21:39.559 --> 02:21:44.398
So whatever we the matrix a, I
can always work with a transpose

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26015-1
02:21:44.398 --> 02:21:48.708
A and a transpose A will always
be positive definite and

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26015-2
02:21:48.708 --> 02:21:53.019
symmetric, so that is what I'm
going to do for my stuff.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26038-0
02:21:55.059 --> 02:22:00.337
OK, so I am going to say I am
going to work with air transpose

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26038-1
02:22:00.337 --> 02:22:01.929
A and a transposer.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26060-0
02:22:04.519 --> 02:22:12.463
OK, so after doing all the
manipulations I'm going to get,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26060-1
02:22:12.463 --> 02:22:14.349
I transpose a.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26085-0
02:22:14.619 --> 02:22:19.572
If I use a transpose SLU I'm I'm
going to get this to be UL

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26085-1
02:22:19.572 --> 02:22:21.389
inverse air transpose.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26096-0
02:22:22.599 --> 02:22:26.429
Now Q is an orthogonal matrix
whose rows are orthogonal.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26106-0
02:22:26.439 --> 02:22:29.989
How do you show that Q is
orthogonal?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26115-0
02:22:30.499 --> 02:22:31.899
You try you transpose.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26146-0
02:22:31.909 --> 02:22:36.741
QQ is nothing but L inverse A
transpose into AL inverse the

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26146-1
02:22:36.741 --> 02:22:42.058
whole transpose, so you will get
this to be a what is a transpose

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26146-2
02:22:42.058 --> 02:22:42.219
A?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26154-0
02:22:45.019 --> 02:22:45.629
And you right.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26157-0
02:22:45.379 --> 02:22:45.599
Hello.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26166-0
02:22:46.839 --> 02:22:49.269
OK, so you get Sunil inverse.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26172-0
02:22:49.279 --> 02:22:52.719
The whole transpose now L
inverse will be.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26186-0
02:22:54.699 --> 02:22:56.629
If I yell is lower triangular,
what is L inverse?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26207-0
02:22:58.649 --> 02:23:00.069
And again load and you.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26205-0
02:22:59.009 --> 02:22:59.719
Lower triangular.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26202-0
02:22:59.069 --> 02:23:00.699
Also lower no training.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26218-0
02:22:59.319 --> 02:22:59.669
Order.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26217-0
02:23:01.259 --> 02:23:02.929
What is the transpose of lower
triangular?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26234-0
02:23:04.139 --> 02:23:04.609
Applause.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26240-0
02:23:04.879 --> 02:23:05.689
Upper Tang.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26241-0
02:23:04.879 --> 02:23:05.609
Upper trending.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26236-0
02:23:05.299 --> 02:23:06.229
Upper triangular.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26256-0
02:23:06.319 --> 02:23:08.504
If you multiply you with another
upper triangular, you'll get

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26256-1
02:23:08.504 --> 02:23:09.879
some upper triangular matrix,
correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26258-0
02:23:10.509 --> 02:23:10.839
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26259-0
02:23:11.099 --> 02:23:11.219
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26270-0
02:23:12.129 --> 02:23:16.429
OK, now Q transpose Q is a
symmetric matrix.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26296-0
02:23:16.539 --> 02:23:20.245
This can be an upper triangular
matrix when is a symmetric

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26296-1
02:23:20.245 --> 02:23:23.889
matrix upper triangular only
when it is a digging matrix.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26299-0
02:23:26.029 --> 02:23:26.409
Agreed.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26301-0
02:23:27.749 --> 02:23:27.889
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26323-0
02:23:29.589 --> 02:23:33.859
So with this, with this year
transpose a transpose, you do

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26312-0
02:23:30.119 --> 02:23:30.709
You should.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26323-1
02:23:33.859 --> 02:23:35.379
Gaussian elimination.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26363-0
02:23:35.449 --> 02:23:40.075
You will get this air transpose
A equal to Lu and then you will

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26363-1
02:23:40.075 --> 02:23:44.195
get the Q is nothing but L
inverse A transpose the whole

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26363-2
02:23:44.195 --> 02:23:45.569
transpose they can.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26382-0
02:23:45.389 --> 02:23:50.079
Sorry, said tell, sorry said
tell Rahul means point #2.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26376-0
02:23:45.579 --> 02:23:47.129
That is, what is the what?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26403-0
02:23:50.089 --> 02:23:54.114
I'm unable to understand Q
transpose of Q is equal to L

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26403-1
02:23:54.114 --> 02:23:55.839
inverse and a transpose.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26415-0
02:23:58.379 --> 02:24:01.989
No, I am saying you get yell
inverse air transports.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26435-0
02:24:05.669 --> 02:24:09.128
When you do this, you get L
inverse a Trump because A

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26435-1
02:24:09.128 --> 02:24:10.089
transpose ACLU.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26459-0
02:24:11.619 --> 02:24:16.473
You'll get L inverse A
transpose, ask you transpose so

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26459-1
02:24:16.473 --> 02:24:19.209
that is that is basically your.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26465-0
02:24:21.119 --> 02:24:22.019
Orthogonal matrix.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26473-0
02:24:23.059 --> 02:24:26.819
You are replacing something with
the QQ transpose.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26486-0
02:24:28.619 --> 02:24:33.949
No, I am saying you start with
the A transpose A transpose.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26505-0
02:24:36.269 --> 02:24:38.759
You start with the A, transpose
A and a transpose.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26529-0
02:24:39.739 --> 02:24:44.250
You give the you give doing this
elementary operations, multiply

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26529-1
02:24:44.250 --> 02:24:46.749
them with all these E1E2,
etcetera.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26556-0
02:24:47.099 --> 02:24:50.170
Ultimately, you'll end up with
you and what you'll end up on

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26556-1
02:24:50.170 --> 02:24:52.939
the right hand side is L inverse
A transpose, correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26566-0
02:24:55.309 --> 02:24:58.049
So but again, I'll inverse is
you right.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26588-0
02:25:00.789 --> 02:25:03.229
Ellen versus no.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26582-0
02:25:02.069 --> 02:25:02.259
You.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26598-0
02:25:03.539 --> 02:25:05.199
In his message he he lonely.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26593-0
02:25:03.619 --> 02:25:04.229
Because then.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26599-0
02:25:05.229 --> 02:25:06.589
Sorry, sorry not stand for.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26606-0
02:25:06.599 --> 02:25:07.449
Sorry my love.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26607-0
02:25:07.549 --> 02:25:08.099
No, no, no.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26616-0
02:25:08.669 --> 02:25:10.659
Yeah, transpose A will have an
Lu.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26618-0
02:25:10.709 --> 02:25:10.959
Why?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26643-0
02:25:10.969 --> 02:25:15.895
Because A transpose, a symmetric
and positive definite correct

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26633-0
02:25:14.179 --> 02:25:14.469
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26643-1
02:25:15.895 --> 02:25:18.319
hmm, that's what I've used him.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26648-0
02:25:18.369 --> 02:25:20.789
So finally you will have your.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26669-0
02:25:22.659 --> 02:25:27.118
Due to be there octagonal matrix
whose columns are orthogonal, so

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26669-1
02:25:27.118 --> 02:25:30.699
you have obtained it after after
normal basis agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26707-0
02:25:35.479 --> 02:25:39.177
So if when we are saying that,
uh, you transport transport

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26707-1
02:25:39.177 --> 02:25:43.251
queue is a symmetric matrix and
can be upper triangular if it is

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26707-2
02:25:43.251 --> 02:25:46.949
diagonal, how does that infer to
that queue is orthogonal?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26722-0
02:25:49.839 --> 02:25:53.759
Like diagonal upper triangular
matrix is orthogonal.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26743-0
02:25:53.289 --> 02:25:57.585
Because OK, once all coming
there it is that when you don't

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26743-1
02:25:57.585 --> 02:26:01.309
write these things down, it
becomes very difficult.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26757-0
02:26:01.499 --> 02:26:04.439
Now one is I am having some
matrix cube.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26759-0
02:26:06.419 --> 02:26:08.869
I am saying uh.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26768-0
02:26:11.459 --> 02:26:12.949
That it is upper triangular
correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26777-0
02:26:14.519 --> 02:26:17.039
That means below the lower
dangle everything is 0.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26782-0
02:26:19.189 --> 02:26:19.619
Got it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26795-0
02:26:23.859 --> 02:26:24.259
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26796-0
02:26:24.049 --> 02:26:24.309
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26791-0
02:26:24.279 --> 02:26:24.769
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26804-0
02:26:24.829 --> 02:26:25.139
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26824-0
02:26:25.329 --> 02:26:29.225
And there in the semantic
matrix, the things here are

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26824-1
02:26:29.225 --> 02:26:33.339
exactly the mirror reflections
are what is here correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26831-0
02:26:33.489 --> 02:26:34.359
So it should be a 0.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26837-0
02:26:36.329 --> 02:26:36.549
Yep.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26839-0
02:26:37.039 --> 02:26:37.319
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26855-0
02:26:37.839 --> 02:26:41.549
So you are queue in terms it is
a diagonal matrix, there is a 0

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26855-1
02:26:41.549 --> 02:26:41.839
here.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26861-0
02:26:41.849 --> 02:26:42.689
There is a 0 here.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26868-0
02:26:42.699 --> 02:26:44.779
Only the diagonal elements are
here, correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26870-0
02:26:45.809 --> 02:26:45.939
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26872-0
02:26:46.959 --> 02:26:47.689
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26904-0
02:26:48.079 --> 02:26:52.745
So can we write a diagonal
matrix Q as there is a Q1 there

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26904-1
02:26:52.745 --> 02:26:54.169
is all zeros here.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26923-0
02:26:54.789 --> 02:27:00.040
Then there is a 0Q2 all zeros
here and the last one will be 0

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26923-1
02:27:00.040 --> 02:27:00.549
zeros.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26928-0
02:27:00.559 --> 02:27:01.879
Maybe QN here correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26930-0
02:27:02.729 --> 02:27:02.909
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26941-0
02:27:04.069 --> 02:27:07.249
Now what is it you want to
prove?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26947-0
02:27:07.359 --> 02:27:08.879
You want to prove it is
orthogonal, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26965-0
02:27:12.109 --> 02:27:14.099
Yeah, like how diagonal matrix
is orthogonal.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26963-0
02:27:14.599 --> 02:27:15.809
Yeah, I'm going to tell you.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26973-0
02:27:15.819 --> 02:27:17.589
So you you tell me the
definition of orthogonal.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26996-0
02:27:24.399 --> 02:27:27.495
If you take the dot product of
any two vectors which are

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/26996-1
02:27:27.495 --> 02:27:29.559
different, you should get a 0,
right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27028-0
02:27:32.139 --> 02:27:35.481
Will you not get a 0 if I do the
the the the inner product and

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27028-1
02:27:35.481 --> 02:27:38.399
the the the dot product of this
with any other vector?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27034-0
02:27:41.009 --> 02:27:41.649
Yes, OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27035-0
02:27:42.759 --> 02:27:43.219
But it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27042-0
02:27:47.289 --> 02:27:47.669
Coding.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27043-0
02:27:48.259 --> 02:27:49.459
Yes, yes, yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27050-0
02:27:51.599 --> 02:27:52.129
That's that.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27053-0
02:27:52.179 --> 02:27:53.039
OK, fine.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27062-0
02:27:53.459 --> 02:27:54.919
So that's what we have done
here.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27065-0
02:27:55.649 --> 02:27:57.019
Uh, I'm sorry.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27073-0
02:27:59.169 --> 02:28:00.549
That's what we have done here.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27079-0
02:28:05.699 --> 02:28:06.349
We have guns here.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27090-0
02:28:07.369 --> 02:28:10.539
You took a transpose, A and a
transpose did this.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27096-0
02:28:10.609 --> 02:28:11.859
You got this matrix.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27110-0
02:28:11.949 --> 02:28:15.396
Now you do the Gauss elimination
to get an upper triangular

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27110-1
02:28:15.396 --> 02:28:15.799
matrix.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27120-0
02:28:15.809 --> 02:28:18.339
Here you get an upper triangular
matrix.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27140-0
02:28:18.349 --> 02:28:23.531
Now you see whatever you have
here that will give you

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27140-1
02:28:23.531 --> 02:28:25.739
something like the the.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27159-0
02:28:27.589 --> 02:28:32.902
Now you see the the two rows
point 3.1 and minus, .25 and

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27159-1
02:28:32.902 --> 02:28:33.269
.75.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27186-0
02:28:33.279 --> 02:28:38.952
These are the orthogonal
elements minus 3.3 into minus

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27186-1
02:28:38.952 --> 02:28:40.809
.25 + .1 into .75.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27193-0
02:28:40.819 --> 02:28:41.859
This will be equal to zero.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27205-0
02:28:42.449 --> 02:28:44.999
OK, so this is what is that
matrix.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27226-0
02:28:45.009 --> 02:28:48.005
This is what is Gram Schmidt all
about, and this is what you've

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27226-1
02:28:48.005 --> 02:28:48.239
done.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27230-0
02:28:48.829 --> 02:28:50.299
OK, it is 5:30.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27235-0
02:28:50.929 --> 02:28:51.479
Can you?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27295-0
02:28:51.489 --> 02:28:55.566
I have done quite a bit of
things here, so can you give me

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27295-1
02:28:55.566 --> 02:28:59.919
half an hour to complete this
portion because I have done most

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27295-2
02:28:59.919 --> 02:29:04.480
of the things that if you want I
can do a quick refresher of what

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27295-3
02:29:04.480 --> 02:29:08.627
we have in lecture 4 in about 10
minutes and then take 2025

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27295-4
02:29:08.627 --> 02:29:10.009
minutes to complete.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27300-0
02:29:10.019 --> 02:29:11.329
This will that be OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27311-0
02:29:13.589 --> 02:29:14.169
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27314-0
02:29:15.179 --> 02:29:16.329
You want a 5 minute break?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27322-0
02:29:16.339 --> 02:29:17.319
I can give you a 5 minute break.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27336-0
02:29:20.449 --> 02:29:21.019
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27347-0
02:29:20.469 --> 02:29:23.519
That we did not get the Cholesky
decomposition method.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27350-0
02:29:21.589 --> 02:29:22.509
We'll go for a break.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27351-0
02:29:23.529 --> 02:29:23.699
Uh.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27372-0
02:29:23.709 --> 02:29:28.113
Like Cholesky decomposition, Lu
explained, right like Lu

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27372-1
02:29:28.113 --> 02:29:29.659
decomposition but I.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27370-0
02:29:28.849 --> 02:29:29.639
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27374-0
02:29:29.849 --> 02:29:30.519
Once please.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27385-0
02:29:31.919 --> 02:29:32.159
Hmm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27388-0
02:29:32.209 --> 02:29:34.399
Uh, the the one which you had
written in the notes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27395-0
02:29:34.469 --> 02:29:35.699
Uh, just that one.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27416-0
02:29:34.869 --> 02:29:35.169
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27400-0
02:29:36.209 --> 02:29:37.559
The Lu decomposition Waller.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27414-0
02:29:40.279 --> 02:29:41.969
Can you please go up, up, up?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27415-0
02:29:41.679 --> 02:29:43.069
It's too much to absorb.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27419-0
02:29:44.809 --> 02:29:45.199
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27449-0
02:29:45.209 --> 02:29:47.469
So lecture for leave it for
today please.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27454-0
02:29:47.409 --> 02:29:48.859
Up to up God.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27437-0
02:29:47.719 --> 02:29:47.969
No.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27444-0
02:29:47.979 --> 02:29:48.589
Yeah, it is.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27464-0
02:29:48.639 --> 02:29:52.389
It has become too much self
really 4 hours.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27463-0
02:29:50.429 --> 02:29:50.989
OK, fine.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27488-0
02:29:52.399 --> 02:29:54.469
It's today whole day we are
there.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27491-0
02:29:53.569 --> 02:29:54.769
Sir, can you please go up?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27485-0
02:29:53.809 --> 02:29:54.369
What's up?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27510-0
02:29:55.269 --> 02:29:59.609
So just give us the overview of
500 if it is OK for all.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27494-0
02:29:55.479 --> 02:29:55.679
It's.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27525-0
02:30:00.129 --> 02:30:01.449
Our five minute 10 minutes I can
do.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27532-0
02:30:00.469 --> 02:30:02.949
Also that we can read it, yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27523-0
02:30:01.559 --> 02:30:02.149
And we will.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27533-0
02:30:02.789 --> 02:30:03.539
OK, take me.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27536-0
02:30:02.899 --> 02:30:03.509
So go up.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27540-0
02:30:05.039 --> 02:30:05.679
Excuse me, Sir?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27545-0
02:30:06.219 --> 02:30:06.399
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27550-0
02:30:07.009 --> 02:30:09.219
Said the derivations are
understood.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27608-0
02:30:09.229 --> 02:30:13.796
I just want to understand when
we are converting a matrix A to

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27608-1
02:30:13.796 --> 02:30:18.581
Lu the process is we are doing a
transpose A and then A transpose

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27575-0
02:30:14.699 --> 02:30:14.829
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27608-2
02:30:18.581 --> 02:30:22.786
and then we are following the
Gauss elimination method to

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27608-3
02:30:22.786 --> 02:30:26.629
convert to a upper matrix upper
triangular matrix U.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27610-0
02:30:25.709 --> 02:30:27.369
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27641-0
02:30:27.399 --> 02:30:32.132
So then how we can conclude that
A is equal to Lu like which one

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27641-1
02:30:32.132 --> 02:30:36.646
is L and which one is used so
that we can write a is equal to

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27641-2
02:30:36.646 --> 02:30:37.229
L&amp;U.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27648-0
02:30:38.909 --> 02:30:39.119
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27669-0
02:30:40.329 --> 02:30:45.009
Now the point is when you're
trying to see if a is symmetric

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27669-1
02:30:45.009 --> 02:30:48.769
and positive definite, you can
do with a itself.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27678-0
02:30:51.629 --> 02:30:51.879
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27683-0
02:30:51.649 --> 02:30:54.459
OK, so can I do a small example?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27684-0
02:30:55.399 --> 02:30:55.819
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27696-0
02:30:58.769 --> 02:31:00.509
Somebody wanted me to go off the
screen.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27713-0
02:31:00.559 --> 02:31:02.899
I don't know for what reason,
but anyway I will do these two.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27736-0
02:31:03.209 --> 02:31:06.399
I just want to do a thorough
job, but so a larger T as

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27736-1
02:31:06.399 --> 02:31:08.139
whether I have left something.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27745-0
02:31:08.349 --> 02:31:10.999
Hey I have left something
kritika and Aparna.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27753-0
02:31:12.939 --> 02:31:14.109
That I am here, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27758-0
02:31:14.119 --> 02:31:15.649
All the topics are covered, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27771-0
02:31:16.339 --> 02:31:19.792
OK, So what I'm saying is,
suppose you have a matrix

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27771-1
02:31:19.792 --> 02:31:20.249
called.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27774-0
02:31:22.919 --> 02:31:23.509
1/2.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27784-0
02:31:25.529 --> 02:31:26.829
To fine.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27788-0
02:31:27.639 --> 02:31:28.319
Is it symmetric?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27795-0
02:31:31.999 --> 02:31:32.429
No, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27796-0
02:31:32.439 --> 02:31:32.599
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27810-0
02:31:33.159 --> 02:31:33.759
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27800-0
02:31:33.649 --> 02:31:34.079
Listen.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27811-0
02:31:34.189 --> 02:31:34.649
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27805-0
02:31:34.229 --> 02:31:34.599
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27814-0
02:31:34.609 --> 02:31:35.509
Is it positive definite?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27817-0
02:31:36.619 --> 02:31:36.869
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27826-0
02:31:37.769 --> 02:31:38.159
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27831-0
02:31:37.849 --> 02:31:37.999
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27834-0
02:31:38.309 --> 02:31:40.119
So this is this is symmetric.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27836-0
02:31:38.369 --> 02:31:38.749
It is.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27837-0
02:31:38.479 --> 02:31:38.939
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27843-0
02:31:40.129 --> 02:31:41.569
This is positive definite,
right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27851-0
02:31:43.589 --> 02:31:44.049
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27859-0
02:31:44.439 --> 02:31:46.289
OK, now OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27854-0
02:31:44.759 --> 02:31:45.139
Mission.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27855-0
02:31:45.039 --> 02:31:45.139
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27872-0
02:31:46.339 --> 02:31:49.729
Now how will I convert it to an
upper triangular form?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27891-0
02:31:49.839 --> 02:31:55.383
So I will multiply this with
something like one 1 -, 2, zero,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27891-1
02:31:55.383 --> 02:31:56.099
correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27904-0
02:31:57.249 --> 02:31:58.979
Yes, yeah, true.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27919-0
02:31:59.099 --> 02:32:03.349
Because my transformation is a
R2 goes to R 2 -, 2 R 1 correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27926-0
02:32:04.989 --> 02:32:05.569
Feature.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27938-0
02:32:06.599 --> 02:32:10.939
So this into 1225 will give me
what?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27950-0
02:32:13.339 --> 02:32:14.669
Upper triangular metrics.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27955-0
02:32:13.349 --> 02:32:18.869
112212 minus two.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27970-0
02:32:18.969 --> 02:32:23.099
Sorry this is not minus 2 into 1
+ 2.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27990-0
02:32:23.109 --> 02:32:29.099
This is the 0 correct and minus
minus minus 4 + 5 is 1 correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27983-0
02:32:24.749 --> 02:32:25.489
Yeah, I'm fine.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/27996-0
02:32:31.929 --> 02:32:32.509
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28029-0
02:32:33.629 --> 02:32:40.110
OK, So what I'm doing is I will
take the inverse of this one 0

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28029-1
02:32:40.110 --> 02:32:46.283
-, 2, one inverse to be called
here, and this I am going to

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28029-2
02:32:46.283 --> 02:32:47.209
call you.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28031-0
02:32:52.589 --> 02:32:52.889
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28039-0
02:32:54.859 --> 02:32:55.259
Got it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28048-0
02:32:56.319 --> 02:32:57.569
Now, what do you have?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28051-0
02:32:56.839 --> 02:32:59.229
You should just one question.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28082-0
02:32:59.239 --> 02:33:05.117
So if I want to write VASU, I'll
write 1225 is equal to 1201 and

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28058-0
02:32:59.649 --> 02:32:59.829
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28082-1
02:33:05.117 --> 02:33:07.559
inverse of one 0 -, 2, one.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28106-0
02:33:07.569 --> 02:33:10.989
This will be my solution for is
equal to AUD composition.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28097-0
02:33:10.319 --> 02:33:10.829
Are you up?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28121-0
02:33:11.069 --> 02:33:14.991
You're you're told in the
opposite way, so this is L

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28121-1
02:33:14.991 --> 02:33:17.729
invoice into a is equal to U,
right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28136-0
02:33:19.619 --> 02:33:20.239
Then it said.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28146-0
02:33:20.699 --> 02:33:24.279
So I'm going to multiply on left
side with the LL inverse.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28165-0
02:33:24.289 --> 02:33:29.159
A will be equal to Lu which will
give me a equal to Lu agreed.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28169-0
02:33:30.389 --> 02:33:30.869
He is.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28179-0
02:33:32.169 --> 02:33:36.193
So you take the elementary
matrix, take its inverse as

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28179-1
02:33:36.193 --> 02:33:36.559
well.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28185-0
02:33:41.539 --> 02:33:41.779
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28190-0
02:33:43.489 --> 02:33:44.099
Who kisses?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28195-0
02:33:44.579 --> 02:33:47.299
OK, Sir and Cholesky method.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28204-0
02:33:48.259 --> 02:33:50.919
Hmm, I will do the same
Cholesky.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28211-0
02:33:51.289 --> 02:33:52.929
Can I do Lu in another way?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28234-0
02:33:58.079 --> 02:34:03.149
SO1225I will write it in in do
little storm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28271-0
02:34:03.209 --> 02:34:09.582
It'll be for example 11L will
have one one and there will be

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28271-1
02:34:09.582 --> 02:34:15.119
L21 and a zero and you will be
U11U12U21U22 correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28274-0
02:34:19.309 --> 02:34:19.789
A little bit.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28294-0
02:34:22.579 --> 02:34:24.119
What will you do and be 0, Sir?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28291-0
02:34:23.839 --> 02:34:24.749
Are you 21?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28302-0
02:34:24.759 --> 02:34:26.629
Should be 0 upper triangular.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28300-0
02:34:27.179 --> 02:34:27.629
Credit.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28305-0
02:34:27.839 --> 02:34:28.319
Very good.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28309-0
02:34:29.989 --> 02:34:30.299
How?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28337-0
02:34:30.309 --> 02:34:33.589
How do you know all those things
is because the number of

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28337-1
02:34:33.589 --> 02:34:36.925
variables here plus the number
of variables here should be

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28337-2
02:34:36.925 --> 02:34:38.679
equal total number of elements.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28353-0
02:34:38.689 --> 02:34:43.679
Here there is one there is 3, so
1 + 3 is equal to four agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28360-0
02:34:45.289 --> 02:34:47.059
Now you visually compare.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28374-0
02:34:47.129 --> 02:34:50.267
If you multiply the first row
and the first column, what you

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28374-1
02:34:50.267 --> 02:34:50.679
get one.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28381-0
02:34:50.729 --> 02:34:51.869
So what should be you one one?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28387-0
02:34:54.359 --> 02:34:54.689
1.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28390-0
02:34:55.029 --> 02:34:55.349
1.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28404-0
02:34:55.749 --> 02:35:00.126
One, if you multiply for example
first row and 2nd column you get

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28396-0
02:34:56.869 --> 02:34:57.129
1.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28404-1
02:35:00.126 --> 02:35:00.259
2.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28414-0
02:35:00.269 --> 02:35:01.389
So what should be you 1/2?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28416-0
02:35:03.349 --> 02:35:03.569
2.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28432-0
02:35:04.459 --> 02:35:09.419
Two, if you multiply 2nd row and
1st column you should get a two.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28438-0
02:35:09.629 --> 02:35:10.379
So what should you?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28443-0
02:35:10.389 --> 02:35:11.439
What should I do on be?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28448-0
02:35:14.829 --> 02:35:14.969
2.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28451-0
02:35:15.949 --> 02:35:16.399
Two.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28464-0
02:35:16.709 --> 02:35:20.809
Now if you multiply 2nd row and
2nd column you should get a

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28464-1
02:35:20.809 --> 02:35:21.219
fight.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28475-0
02:35:21.229 --> 02:35:23.119
So you should get a U 2/2 equal
to 1 right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28484-0
02:35:26.969 --> 02:35:28.319
The King drew and.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28491-0
02:35:29.569 --> 02:35:29.819
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28500-0
02:35:29.649 --> 02:35:30.529
Yeah, correct. Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28506-0
02:35:30.249 --> 02:35:31.269
That is correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28504-0
02:35:30.919 --> 02:35:32.289
So you've got L and you.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28511-0
02:35:31.279 --> 02:35:31.819
Yeah, one.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28512-0
02:35:32.579 --> 02:35:33.369
This is your L.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28517-0
02:35:33.379 --> 02:35:35.349
This is your U now.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28544-0
02:35:35.739 --> 02:35:39.809
For example, if you want to do
Cholesky decomposition, so you

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28544-1
02:35:39.809 --> 02:35:43.552
should be able to write which
one you want me to write L

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28544-2
02:35:43.552 --> 02:35:44.209
transpose.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28551-0
02:35:47.059 --> 02:35:48.019
There's this Doolittle.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28554-0
02:35:50.519 --> 02:35:51.339
Now cholesky.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28593-0
02:35:54.479 --> 02:36:04.243
Here you have 1225 equal to LL
transpose, L is L11 and then

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28593-1
02:36:04.243 --> 02:36:11.079
0L21L22 and the transpose of
this L11L21.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28602-0
02:36:13.399 --> 02:36:14.989
0L22 correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28605-0
02:36:17.049 --> 02:36:17.499
Why?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28617-0
02:36:17.579 --> 02:36:18.809
You have zero over there so.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28619-0
02:36:18.929 --> 02:36:19.099

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28641-0
02:36:20.999 --> 02:36:23.219
It's 10, pretend lower.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28636-0
02:36:21.819 --> 02:36:22.689
This is yell.

02:36:22.779 --> 02:36:23.809
This is yell transpose.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28648-0
02:36:24.799 --> 02:36:25.559
Lower triangular.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28668-0
02:36:26.759 --> 02:36:29.852
Yeah, lot drive written low
triangle only and L transpose

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28665-0
02:36:29.849 --> 02:36:30.129
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28668-1
02:36:29.852 --> 02:36:31.559
will be upper triangular. Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28678-0
02:36:31.409 --> 02:36:32.989

02:36:34.059 --> 02:36:35.269
So what is L1 square?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28688-0
02:36:37.999 --> 02:36:38.479
1.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28689-0
02:36:39.039 --> 02:36:39.299
1.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28690-0
02:36:39.259 --> 02:36:40.219
So what is L11?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28692-0
02:36:42.049 --> 02:36:42.269
1.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28695-0
02:36:44.239 --> 02:36:44.539
1.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28697-0
02:36:45.659 --> 02:36:45.919

02:36:46.719 --> 02:36:53.989
One and then you will have one
into L21 will be equal to two.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28725-0
02:36:53.999 --> 02:36:54.969
So what is L21?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28729-0
02:36:57.699 --> 02:36:57.839
2.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28730-0
02:36:59.069 --> 02:36:59.179
To.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28732-0
02:37:01.939 --> 02:37:02.079
Then.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28740-0
02:37:05.849 --> 02:37:06.709
AT22 ish 2.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28751-0
02:37:08.179 --> 02:37:09.149
So the L21 is 2.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28758-0
02:37:08.369 --> 02:37:12.889
So now the L22 square will be
equal to 1 right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28781-0
02:37:17.449 --> 02:37:19.079
We 22 square equal to 5.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28794-0
02:37:17.699 --> 02:37:20.969
5 minutes more 5 minutes full.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28810-0
02:37:20.159 --> 02:37:23.314
No, no, 4 plus L22 square will
be equal to five, so L2 to

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28798-0
02:37:21.269 --> 02:37:21.569
No, no.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28810-1
02:37:23.314 --> 02:37:24.729
square will be equal to 1.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28815-0
02:37:24.739 --> 02:37:25.949
So this will be 11, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28825-0
02:37:28.539 --> 02:37:28.969
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28826-0

02:37:30.269 --> 02:37:32.549
So your phone yelling you
L&amp;L transpose.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28840-0
02:37:40.369 --> 02:37:40.789
Agreed.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28845-0

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28848-0
02:37:43.799 --> 02:37:45.279
OK, not very difficult.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28898-0
02:37:47.919 --> 02:37:51.699
Said it was a small matrix, we
have found it, but there should

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28868-0
02:37:48.029 --> 02:37:48.609
Should I give?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28898-1
02:37:51.699 --> 02:37:54.279
be some formula or a procedure
to find it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28883-0
02:37:53.459 --> 02:37:53.709
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28894-0
02:37:53.719 --> 02:37:54.829
Yeah, you have a formula.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28899-0
02:37:54.839 --> 02:37:55.699
Now I have given that.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28937-0
02:38:02.249 --> 02:38:07.311
So this is all the formulas you
have, and in octave you can even

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28937-1
02:38:07.311 --> 02:38:09.259
write Lu, so you say you.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28959-0
02:38:07.429 --> 02:38:11.504
There will be will be doing this
in the webinar also, so I'll be

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28959-1
02:38:11.504 --> 02:38:15.202
solving example for them to do
like from the previous year

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28959-2
02:38:15.202 --> 02:38:15.579
paper.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28968-0
02:38:15.969 --> 02:38:17.099
A similar one actually.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28970-0
02:38:16.079 --> 02:38:18.369
So yeah, equal random 4 comma 4.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28973-0
02:38:18.659 --> 02:38:19.609
You just wait.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28976-0
02:38:19.679 --> 02:38:20.429
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28986-0
02:38:22.209 --> 02:38:26.799
Yell U equal to Lu of A.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/28997-0
02:38:29.969 --> 02:38:31.699
You did a yell and you get a U
not.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29005-0
02:38:40.049 --> 02:38:42.069
You can also do elementary
transformation.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29024-0
02:38:42.079 --> 02:38:46.420
You can do a lot of things with
this stuff, OK, Cholesky is

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29024-1
02:38:46.420 --> 02:38:48.519
also, is there a help Ch lol.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29029-0
02:38:52.139 --> 02:38:53.549
So this is uh.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29050-0
02:38:57.009 --> 02:39:00.099
Nopper Cholesky factor R is
computed in the.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29059-0
02:39:00.109 --> 02:39:03.259
All these functions are there to
help you with this.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29068-0
02:39:03.269 --> 02:39:04.879
You just need to understand the
method OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29070-0
02:39:13.579 --> 02:39:13.979
Agreed.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29075-0
02:39:16.549 --> 02:39:16.889
Agreed.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29076-0

Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29080-0
02:39:17.669 --> 02:39:18.289
OK, fine.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29101-0
02:39:19.419 --> 02:39:23.038
Should they kill you with the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors now

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29101-1
02:39:23.038 --> 02:39:24.819
or leave it for the next class?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29111-0
02:39:26.349 --> 02:39:26.779
Ah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29123-0
02:39:27.579 --> 02:39:29.089
Leave it for next class but.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29121-0
02:39:28.669 --> 02:39:29.089
Go back.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29119-0
02:39:29.159 --> 02:39:29.849
Very good.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29137-0
02:39:30.249 --> 02:39:30.819
Fair enough.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29144-0
02:39:30.969 --> 02:39:31.569
Yeah, I agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29131-0
02:39:31.119 --> 02:39:31.629
Leave it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29141-0
02:39:31.639 --> 02:39:32.389
Leave it for next.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29155-0
02:39:32.399 --> 02:39:34.149
After whole day we are in class
today.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29156-0
02:39:34.509 --> 02:39:35.429
OK, fine, fine.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29161-0
02:39:35.479 --> 02:39:36.109
Fair enough.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29170-0
02:39:35.629 --> 02:39:36.579
The so so.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29169-0
02:39:35.869 --> 02:39:36.129
Ah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29189-0
02:39:36.119 --> 02:39:39.539
I just asked your opinion taken
so.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29184-0
02:39:38.689 --> 02:39:38.849
It's.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29187-0
02:39:38.739 --> 02:39:41.149
So if you don't mind, and if you
have time.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29195-0
02:39:41.219 --> 02:39:43.259
Uh Lu decomposition theory.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29201-0
02:39:43.269 --> 02:39:44.109
Part once please.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29220-0
02:39:44.199 --> 02:39:45.689
I mean the one which you had
started.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29212-0
02:39:44.689 --> 02:39:45.169
Yeah, sure.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29217-0
02:39:45.849 --> 02:39:46.319
Hold on.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29235-0
02:39:46.449 --> 02:39:50.341
People who want to leave now can
leave and others who want to

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29235-1
02:39:50.341 --> 02:39:50.969
stay back.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29243-0
02:39:50.979 --> 02:39:52.489
They can stay back and ask me
something.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29252-0
02:39:54.109 --> 02:39:54.779
Is a please.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29263-0
02:39:55.889 --> 02:39:57.719
OK, So what is it that you want?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29276-0
02:39:58.579 --> 02:40:01.580
The Lu decomposition theory part
the one which you had started

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29276-1
02:40:01.580 --> 02:40:01.819
with.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29282-0
02:40:03.669 --> 02:40:04.539
I had not started.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29290-0
02:40:04.549 --> 02:40:05.569
Now I had finished it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29296-0
02:40:06.239 --> 02:40:07.009
No, no.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29298-0
02:40:06.399 --> 02:40:06.849
Take it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29307-0
02:40:07.159 --> 02:40:08.079
During the starting.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29326-0
02:40:09.359 --> 02:40:15.036
I don't know what I'm saying is
you initially you check if you

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29326-1
02:40:15.036 --> 02:40:16.929
are given a matrix A.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29342-0
02:40:17.139 --> 02:40:23.499
OK, let's assume that this is
symmetric and positive definite.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29334-0
02:40:18.159 --> 02:40:18.439
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29349-0
02:40:25.509 --> 02:40:25.769
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29355-0
02:40:26.909 --> 02:40:28.609
Now then, Lu exists.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29367-0
02:40:30.379 --> 02:40:30.779
Great.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29371-0
02:40:30.709 --> 02:40:32.479
Now, how do you find this Lees?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29384-0
02:40:32.969 --> 02:40:36.359
You take A and you try to check.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29401-0
02:40:36.369 --> 02:40:41.448
So if A is a matrix like this,
it has elements here, here,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29401-1
02:40:41.448 --> 02:40:41.879
here.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29422-0
02:40:42.209 --> 02:40:44.976
Now you find we are the first to
make it to an upper triangular

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29422-1
02:40:44.976 --> 02:40:45.279
matrix.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29433-0
02:40:45.289 --> 02:40:47.389
So first idea is to make this
guy 0 correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29434-0
02:40:48.219 --> 02:40:48.519
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29438-0
02:40:50.549 --> 02:40:50.809
Right.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29478-0
02:40:52.299 --> 02:40:57.157
Now what you do to make this guy
zero is to sort of create an

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29478-1
02:40:57.157 --> 02:41:02.016
elementary matrix where you put
the multiplicative factor you

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29478-2
02:41:02.016 --> 02:41:05.229
use from this first row to make
it zero.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29492-0
02:41:05.649 --> 02:41:07.239
That I'm going to call you E1.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29491-0
02:41:08.169 --> 02:41:08.389
Right.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29505-0
02:41:08.369 --> 02:41:13.279
OK, now the second one is I have
to make this guy zero.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29515-0
02:41:13.289 --> 02:41:15.299
I will call that matrix as SE2.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29525-0
02:41:15.569 --> 02:41:17.699
They're all elementary matrix ID
matrices.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29531-0
02:41:17.709 --> 02:41:19.729
Only that element I'm going to
middle.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29537-0
02:41:20.969 --> 02:41:21.209
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29547-0
02:41:22.069 --> 02:41:26.019
Now so you will do several other
operations.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29564-0
02:41:26.029 --> 02:41:30.151
In this case you will do one
more E3 to get this A to B equal

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29564-1
02:41:30.151 --> 02:41:31.149
to an U, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29566-0
02:41:33.329 --> 02:41:33.649
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29572-0
02:41:36.229 --> 02:41:36.449
No.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29589-0
02:41:36.459 --> 02:41:39.148
But anyway, even need to are
multiplied with a, it will give

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29589-1
02:41:39.148 --> 02:41:39.589
you right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29602-0
02:41:41.389 --> 02:41:42.299
Weight 3 again.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29600-0
02:41:41.839 --> 02:41:43.069
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29614-0
02:41:43.299 --> 02:41:45.489
You multiply E3 to E1A.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29625-0
02:41:45.499 --> 02:41:47.549
You are going to get a U upper
triangular matrix, correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29633-0
02:41:49.569 --> 02:41:50.889
Even eat our enough right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29640-0
02:41:50.899 --> 02:41:51.799
So why E3 again?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29647-0
02:41:53.179 --> 02:41:54.469
No, this is not there.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29663-0
02:41:54.479 --> 02:41:56.599
No upper triangle I have to make
this guy easier now.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29661-0
02:41:57.629 --> 02:41:57.919
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29672-0
02:41:57.929 --> 02:41:59.109
OK, OK. Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29677-0
02:41:59.689 --> 02:42:00.719
So that is E 3.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29686-0
02:42:00.869 --> 02:42:01.849
So this is E 3.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29684-0
02:42:01.459 --> 02:42:01.659
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29699-0
02:42:02.829 --> 02:42:06.209
This is E2 and this is even you
agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29697-0
02:42:06.289 --> 02:42:06.739
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29713-0
02:42:06.989 --> 02:42:08.169
Yes, yes, got it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29718-0
02:42:08.339 --> 02:42:10.849
So that's why I didn't even E2E3
the reverse order.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29724-0
02:42:10.909 --> 02:42:11.999
OK, fine. Now.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29741-0
02:42:11.579 --> 02:42:11.859
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29743-0
02:42:13.289 --> 02:42:19.489
He's HE1E2 and E3 are lower
triangular matrices, correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29747-0
02:42:20.109 --> 02:42:20.439
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29771-0
02:42:21.469 --> 02:42:26.157
Therefore the product is also
lower triangular E 3 * E two

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29762-0
02:42:24.509 --> 02:42:24.669
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29771-1
02:42:26.157 --> 02:42:28.859
times E1E slow triangle,
correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29774-0
02:42:29.659 --> 02:42:29.969
Good.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29786-0
02:42:30.849 --> 02:42:35.669
Now the inverse offer lower
triangular matrix.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29791-0
02:42:37.159 --> 02:42:38.509
He's also lower render, correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29805-0
02:42:41.469 --> 02:42:43.129
This I didn't get, Sir. How?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29808-0
02:42:43.199 --> 02:42:46.029
This wouldn't get so for
example.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29819-0
02:42:48.589 --> 02:42:49.629
This is very easy to see.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29835-0
02:42:50.549 --> 02:42:53.630
Make me write and lower
triangular matrix so the lower

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29835-1
02:42:53.630 --> 02:42:54.639
triangular matrix.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29850-0
02:42:54.649 --> 02:42:58.819
I will say L11L21L22.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29854-0
02:42:59.429 --> 02:43:00.639
Then all zero zeros.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29863-0
02:43:00.649 --> 02:43:02.159
This is all 00 zeros.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29883-0
02:43:02.609 --> 02:43:06.239
Then you'll have a yell and 1L
and two up to Ln, correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29886-0
02:43:06.959 --> 02:43:07.279
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29926-0
02:43:08.349 --> 02:43:18.337
Now suppose you have the inverse
as a 11A12 up to A1NA21A22 up to

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29926-1
02:43:18.337 --> 02:43:25.299
a 2N and it is the AN-1A and two
up to Anand.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29947-0
02:43:26.549 --> 02:43:29.324
Now if you multiply these two,
you should get a one along the

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29947-1
02:43:29.324 --> 02:43:31.339
diagonal and zero here and zero
here, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29975-0
02:43:35.539 --> 02:43:38.624
What is the meaning of inverse
the the multiplication of L with

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29975-1
02:43:38.624 --> 02:43:40.939
L inverse should be equal to
identity, correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29978-0
02:43:41.469 --> 02:43:42.289
Yes, yes, yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29998-0
02:43:43.659 --> 02:43:48.008
OK, now by claim is if you
multiply the first row with the

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/29998-1
02:43:48.008 --> 02:43:49.999
second column what you get.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30010-0
02:43:59.179 --> 02:44:00.179
L11A12.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30015-0
02:44:00.999 --> 02:44:02.679
Ah, and what is element here?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30019-0
02:44:03.749 --> 02:44:04.079
0.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30037-0
02:44:05.279 --> 02:44:09.209
Since L11 is non zero, what is
the possibility A-12 is 0 right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30040-0
02:44:10.129 --> 02:44:10.409
Right.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30043-0
02:44:10.819 --> 02:44:11.029
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30045-0
02:44:11.689 --> 02:44:12.319
Zero.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30056-0
02:44:12.769 --> 02:44:15.399
If you take any other element,
you'll get the same thing.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30068-0
02:44:15.409 --> 02:44:18.119
Now, can these elements be non
zero?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30083-0
02:44:17.949 --> 02:44:18.529
All zero.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30076-0
02:44:18.129 --> 02:44:19.199
It can never be nonzero.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30088-0
02:44:19.209 --> 02:44:20.339
This will all be zeros, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30090-0
02:44:21.039 --> 02:44:21.319
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30099-0
02:44:22.809 --> 02:44:23.169
Agreed.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30104-0
02:44:23.899 --> 02:44:24.769
Got it, got it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30118-0
02:44:24.769 --> 02:44:28.140
You can use similar way to prove
that L inverse is also lower

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30118-1
02:44:28.140 --> 02:44:28.739
triangular.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30115-0
02:44:29.209 --> 02:44:29.589
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30123-0
02:44:29.599 --> 02:44:30.459
Yes, understood.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30130-0
02:44:30.729 --> 02:44:31.409
This is quite good.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30163-0
02:44:30.899 --> 02:44:36.975
So E3E2E1 the product is lower
triangular, I can write this

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30163-1
02:44:36.975 --> 02:44:42.647
even E2E 3AS L inverse the
inverse of some of the lower

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30163-2
02:44:42.647 --> 02:44:44.369
telemetrics yell.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30184-0
02:44:44.779 --> 02:44:47.714
So I'm getting L inverse a it
will be equal to an upper

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30184-1
02:44:47.714 --> 02:44:49.969
triangular, which will imply a
equal to L.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30190-0
02:44:54.789 --> 02:44:55.099
No, no.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30202-0
02:44:54.809 --> 02:44:55.229
Got it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30194-0
02:44:55.109 --> 02:44:55.699
How is?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30206-0
02:44:55.849 --> 02:44:57.119
How is Ellen was say you?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30213-0
02:44:58.409 --> 02:45:00.149
Because you have converted
everything to you.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30219-0
02:45:00.159 --> 02:45:01.219
No right hand side.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30225-0
02:45:03.409 --> 02:45:04.219
Hey, Bubba.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30228-0
02:45:04.889 --> 02:45:05.979
Then they multiply.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30242-0
02:45:05.989 --> 02:45:09.149
Yeah, with E1 I have made this
great 0 correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30246-0
02:45:10.099 --> 02:45:10.249
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30264-0
02:45:11.279 --> 02:45:13.929
Then I multiply this E1A with
E2.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30259-0
02:45:13.039 --> 02:45:13.289
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30267-0
02:45:13.299 --> 02:45:14.169
Yeah, it's in a pattern.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30273-0
02:45:13.939 --> 02:45:14.959
I'm reading this zero.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30281-0
02:45:15.799 --> 02:45:16.029
Mm-hmm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30284-0
02:45:16.049 --> 02:45:18.459
Then you multiply E3 with E2 E
1A.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30305-0
02:45:18.469 --> 02:45:21.050
I'm making this day zero, so
finally I'm getting an upper

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30302-0
02:45:20.399 --> 02:45:20.589
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30305-1
02:45:21.050 --> 02:45:22.029
triangle matrix right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30311-0
02:45:22.739 --> 02:45:23.019
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30326-0
02:45:23.639 --> 02:45:28.989
So E3E2E1A equal to U now E3 to
E1.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30356-0
02:45:28.999 --> 02:45:32.313
I'm going to call this L inverse
because L inverse is going to be

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30345-0
02:45:31.199 --> 02:45:31.519
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30356-1
02:45:32.313 --> 02:45:33.769
again a lot training metrics.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30370-0
02:45:34.229 --> 02:45:37.449
So lower triangular matrix into
inverse into a equal to U.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30362-0
02:45:34.339 --> 02:45:34.659
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30378-0
02:45:37.459 --> 02:45:38.879
So a is equal to L int.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30385-0
02:45:39.659 --> 02:45:42.279
Correct, correct, correct. Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30382-0
02:45:41.029 --> 02:45:41.249
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30400-0
02:45:43.319 --> 02:45:45.279
OK, fine. Thank.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30428-0
02:45:44.389 --> 02:45:48.143
So in that case A can a can also
be equal to all inverse you

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30428-1
02:45:48.143 --> 02:45:51.652
write because LL is lower
triangular L versus also lower

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30415-0
02:45:49.939 --> 02:45:50.429
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30441-0
02:45:50.939 --> 02:45:54.774
Yeah, but, but by making that
yell inverse, you're not going

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30428-2
02:45:51.652 --> 02:45:52.329
triangular.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30441-1
02:45:54.774 --> 02:45:57.289
to achieve any computational
advantage.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30451-0
02:46:01.019 --> 02:46:01.599
Excuse me, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30454-0
02:46:02.199 --> 02:46:02.449
Hmm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30473-0
02:46:03.109 --> 02:46:07.680
Can we see my metric is a
product of my row echelon form

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30473-1
02:46:07.680 --> 02:46:11.369
and the inverse matrix of my
transformations?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30481-0
02:46:15.689 --> 02:46:16.469
You know, make sense, yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30501-0
02:46:20.459 --> 02:46:23.409
In the week since, means like
uh, will it not apply?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30546-0
02:46:23.419 --> 02:46:27.998
Like if I'm converting to upper
triangular so that is equivalent

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30517-0
02:46:26.859 --> 02:46:27.159
Hmm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30546-1
02:46:27.998 --> 02:46:32.506
to my row echelon form of A and
if I am shifting this L inverse

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30546-2
02:46:32.506 --> 02:46:36.029
to L which is like my elementary
transformations.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30555-0
02:46:36.509 --> 02:46:37.259
Exactly.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30559-0
02:46:36.599 --> 02:46:38.779
So this is the inverse of my.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30567-0
02:46:37.829 --> 02:46:42.659
Any elementary only point is in
the row echelon form.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30599-0
02:46:42.669 --> 02:46:45.184
Why I'm not that much for row
Echelon form is this is

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30599-1
02:46:45.184 --> 02:46:47.839
something which I'm going to
apply for a specific matrix

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30599-2
02:46:47.839 --> 02:46:49.609
which is symmetric positive
definite.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30605-0
02:46:50.889 --> 02:46:51.449
Not for all.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30614-0
02:46:51.979 --> 02:46:54.879
And it is basically for N cross
N systems.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30619-0
02:46:56.399 --> 02:46:57.709
So I will.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30626-0
02:46:56.589 --> 02:46:57.009
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30635-0
02:46:57.719 --> 02:47:00.946
I'm gonna call it as a ghost
elimination procedure to do

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30635-1
02:47:00.946 --> 02:47:01.229
that.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30673-0
02:47:01.519 --> 02:47:04.563
If you are going to do for any
ANKUR N cross M matrix M, cross

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30673-1
02:47:04.563 --> 02:47:07.414
N, matrix P, cross Q matrix,
etcetera, you can call it row

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30673-2
02:47:07.414 --> 02:47:09.589
echelon form, but both are one
and the same.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30675-0
02:47:10.959 --> 02:47:11.179
Ohh.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30676-0
02:47:11.859 --> 02:47:12.079
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30681-0
02:47:14.659 --> 02:47:15.559
Said one question.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30716-0
02:47:15.569 --> 02:47:21.020
Maybe you covered it, but I want
to ask why while doing the lower

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30696-0
02:47:18.139 --> 02:47:18.379
Ah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30716-1
02:47:21.020 --> 02:47:26.389
while we were doing the finding
the L right so we should not do.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30719-0
02:47:25.339 --> 02:47:25.519
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30725-0
02:47:26.489 --> 02:47:29.069
We should not move the row up
and down.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30734-0
02:47:29.179 --> 02:47:30.009
Why is that, Sir?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30742-0
02:47:30.629 --> 02:47:32.879
Yeah, I will tell you it's a
good question.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30764-0
02:47:32.969 --> 02:47:35.438
I thought I will ask in the
examination, but you have asked

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30764-1
02:47:35.438 --> 02:47:36.509
me now change my question.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30775-0
02:47:37.629 --> 02:47:38.879
No, give it the sensor.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30773-0
02:47:37.809 --> 02:47:38.309
OK, then.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30782-0
02:47:39.149 --> 02:47:42.129
Now the only point is you are
going to.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30797-0
02:47:42.409 --> 02:47:47.897
Yeah, you see, if you understand
this process, maybe I'll ask,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30797-1
02:47:47.897 --> 02:47:49.379
are the TS there?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30801-0
02:47:51.209 --> 02:47:51.809
No, I just.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30806-0
02:47:54.369 --> 02:47:54.819
Not really.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30817-0
02:47:56.549 --> 02:48:00.479
OK, whenever tough questions are
there, people disappear.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30886-0
02:48:01.349 --> 02:48:06.054
OK, now let me tell you, you
see, you understood this concept

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30886-1
02:48:06.054 --> 02:48:10.759
like even is lower triangular,
he too slow triangular E3 slow

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30845-0
02:48:09.029 --> 02:48:09.389
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30856-0
02:48:10.599 --> 02:48:12.319
Yes, Sir. Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30886-2
02:48:10.759 --> 02:48:15.236
triangular multiplication of
these three is low triangular

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30864-0
02:48:11.619 --> 02:48:11.819
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30886-3
02:48:15.236 --> 02:48:19.259
and the inverse of a load range
is lower triangular.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30876-0
02:48:16.279 --> 02:48:16.589
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30877-0
02:48:16.809 --> 02:48:16.949
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30892-0
02:48:20.009 --> 02:48:20.299
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30894-0
02:48:20.569 --> 02:48:20.709
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30898-0
02:48:20.849 --> 02:48:20.989
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30901-0
02:48:20.889 --> 02:48:23.399
So this is this is what I have
agreed upon.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30908-0
02:48:23.669 --> 02:48:25.709
Suppose I have something like.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30907-0
02:48:24.369 --> 02:48:24.459
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30914-0
02:48:28.509 --> 02:48:31.149
0124.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30934-0
02:48:34.429 --> 02:48:38.748
Suppose I have a matrix and I
want to convert it to upper

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30928-0
02:48:36.299 --> 02:48:36.659
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30934-1
02:48:38.748 --> 02:48:39.419
triangle.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30939-0
02:48:42.029 --> 02:48:42.869
This is my year.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30953-0
02:48:44.619 --> 02:48:48.273
I need some transformation to
convert it into upper triangular

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30953-1
02:48:48.273 --> 02:48:48.679
matrix.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30968-0
02:48:49.729 --> 02:48:53.149
Now what I need is I need to
swap these two, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30973-0
02:48:56.679 --> 02:48:56.809
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30983-0
02:48:58.259 --> 02:48:58.589
Listen.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/30993-0
02:48:58.259 --> 02:49:02.829
So there is an elementary
transformation which is 0110.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31004-0
02:49:03.299 --> 02:49:06.799
If I multiply this with 0124
what I get?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31015-0
02:49:15.109 --> 02:49:16.009
24.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31020-0
02:49:16.229 --> 02:49:17.579
401.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31040-0
02:49:18.159 --> 02:49:23.019
So good 0124, the 1st 1:01 and
the.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31026-0
02:49:18.509 --> 02:49:18.669
What?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31038-0
02:49:21.159 --> 02:49:21.319
Who?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31045-0
02:49:24.829 --> 02:49:24.969
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31053-0
02:49:25.309 --> 02:49:27.129
2401 correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31061-0
02:49:28.539 --> 02:49:29.039
Hmm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31059-0
02:49:28.619 --> 02:49:28.739
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31062-0
02:49:28.689 --> 02:49:30.739
That is exactly the swapping of
these two, correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31065-0
02:49:33.189 --> 02:49:33.329
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31083-0
02:49:35.069 --> 02:49:40.209
So now I have got out of the
lower triangular property.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31089-0
02:49:41.779 --> 02:49:44.279
The elementary matrix is no
longer lower triangle.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31091-0
02:49:46.699 --> 02:49:46.939
Right.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31115-0
02:49:49.439 --> 02:49:55.474
Agreed, the property will be
true only when I have all the

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31095-0
02:49:49.919 --> 02:49:50.469
The.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31115-1
02:49:55.474 --> 02:49:57.009
elementary row.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31155-0
02:49:57.059 --> 02:50:01.459
Elementary matrices as lower
triangle now then there is a

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31128-0
02:50:00.039 --> 02:50:00.389
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31155-1
02:50:01.459 --> 02:50:06.087
swab I have to even change the
rows of the elementary matrix

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31155-2
02:50:06.087 --> 02:50:10.639
which will make it lose the
property lower render property.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31162-0
02:50:14.679 --> 02:50:15.019
Agreed.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31175-0
02:50:16.189 --> 02:50:19.199
And how did we come with that
matrix at 0110?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31204-0
02:50:19.249 --> 02:50:23.473
The one which you have circled
the the one that is that you

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31192-0
02:50:21.419 --> 02:50:21.829
Which one?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31204-1
02:50:23.473 --> 02:50:24.389
have circled.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31217-0
02:50:24.459 --> 02:50:27.643
It is basically I want to change
the 2nd row to first round first

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31217-1
02:50:27.643 --> 02:50:28.609
row, the second row.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31231-0
02:50:28.619 --> 02:50:31.089
So I change the rows of the
elementary matrix.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31244-0
02:50:31.099 --> 02:50:33.349
Elementary matrix is identity
matrix which change the rows.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31241-0
02:50:32.449 --> 02:50:32.709
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31248-0
02:50:34.119 --> 02:50:34.759
OK. OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31252-0
02:50:34.969 --> 02:50:35.369
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31256-0
02:50:36.109 --> 02:50:37.639
But I lose the lower triangular
property.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31257-0
02:50:38.499 --> 02:50:38.779
Right.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31260-0
02:50:41.339 --> 02:50:41.559
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31261-0
02:50:42.519 --> 02:50:42.819
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31267-0
02:50:46.819 --> 02:50:48.099
OK fine. So.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31275-0
02:50:49.819 --> 02:50:50.509
Set the stand.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31286-0
02:50:50.259 --> 02:50:50.579
You can.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31291-0
02:50:50.519 --> 02:50:52.389
You go to the last slide,
please.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31290-0
02:50:51.149 --> 02:50:51.909
I have one question.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31304-0
02:50:52.739 --> 02:50:55.689
Last slide, last slide of the
lecture. Three.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31307-0
02:50:52.949 --> 02:50:55.029
That last night?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31310-0
02:50:55.759 --> 02:50:56.039
Yeah, yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31311-0
02:50:56.679 --> 02:50:57.259
Uh, sure.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31351-0
02:51:00.009 --> 02:51:04.157
Yeah, this one I I didn't get
this 8 transpose a augmented by

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31351-1
02:51:04.157 --> 02:51:08.439
a transpose to get UL transpose
a I mean L inverse A transpose.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31376-0
02:51:08.609 --> 02:51:13.341
OK, so I said every symmetric
positive definite matrix has an

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31370-0
02:51:09.209 --> 02:51:09.339
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31376-1
02:51:13.341 --> 02:51:14.639
Lu decomposition.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31379-0
02:51:14.649 --> 02:51:14.899
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31381-0
02:51:15.589 --> 02:51:15.959
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31408-0
02:51:16.849 --> 02:51:21.117
Now, given any damn AI have
proved already that a transpose

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31408-1
02:51:21.117 --> 02:51:24.959
A is a symmetric positive
definite matrix, you agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31416-0
02:51:24.789 --> 02:51:25.909
Correct, correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31419-0
02:51:25.839 --> 02:51:27.709
So a transpose A will have an
Lu.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31423-0
02:51:29.079 --> 02:51:29.219
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31436-0
02:51:30.409 --> 02:51:33.799
So I use a transpose A as well
into U.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31445-0
02:51:35.249 --> 02:51:35.479
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31459-0
02:51:35.679 --> 02:51:39.896
And I start with something like
a transpose A and a transpose as

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31459-1
02:51:39.896 --> 02:51:41.259
the augmented matrix.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31463-0
02:51:43.889 --> 02:51:44.489
No, but why?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31476-0
02:51:46.409 --> 02:51:47.399
Meaning why you meaning?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31495-0
02:51:48.219 --> 02:51:51.014
I mean, why did we take the
augmented matrix of a transpose

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31495-1
02:51:51.014 --> 02:51:51.899
A into a transpose?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31510-0
02:51:52.319 --> 02:51:56.681
Yeah, transpose A is what I know
for sure is a symmetric positive

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31510-1
02:51:56.681 --> 02:51:57.739
definite matrix.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31513-0
02:51:58.539 --> 02:51:58.759
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31522-0
02:52:00.139 --> 02:52:02.239
So I want to take positive
definite matrix.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31529-0
02:52:02.249 --> 02:52:04.389
See is this matrix positive
definite?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31537-0
02:52:04.399 --> 02:52:05.799
Whatever I've taken in the
example here.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31557-0
02:52:11.499 --> 02:52:13.619
Is 0124 positive definite?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31561-0
02:52:11.699 --> 02:52:14.259
0124 no.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31553-0
02:52:12.079 --> 02:52:12.299
No.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31563-0
02:52:14.429 --> 02:52:14.629
No.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31566-0
02:52:14.799 --> 02:52:15.529
He said symmetric.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31571-0
02:52:16.599 --> 02:52:16.759
No.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31568-0
02:52:17.349 --> 02:52:17.839
No.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31573-0
02:52:17.539 --> 02:52:17.739
No.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31607-0
02:52:17.989 --> 02:52:22.009
So the point is I want to get
into a system where you have

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31607-1
02:52:22.009 --> 02:52:26.030
given me some basis 02 and 1/4
and I want to get into some

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31607-2
02:52:26.030 --> 02:52:27.189
orthogonal basis.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31621-0
02:52:28.159 --> 02:52:30.349
Now how do I get into orthogonal
basis?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31619-0
02:52:28.389 --> 02:52:28.639
Mm-hmm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31627-0
02:52:30.359 --> 02:52:31.609
Is the orthogonal basis.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31638-0
02:52:31.619 --> 02:52:33.139
It's so it is something like
this.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31642-0
02:52:34.149 --> 02:52:35.289
A whole asked me this question.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31649-0
02:52:37.739 --> 02:52:38.069
Name.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31655-0
02:52:38.029 --> 02:52:40.089
Krishna SANTHOSH.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31654-0
02:52:38.189 --> 02:52:39.909
Santosh Santosh, OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31657-0
02:52:40.139 --> 02:52:41.679
That santosh.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31668-0
02:52:41.909 --> 02:52:44.029
OK, Santosh, it is something
like this.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31680-0
02:52:44.099 --> 02:52:47.189
I already told you some basics
can be like this also correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31682-0
02:52:48.509 --> 02:52:48.689
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31701-0
02:52:50.199 --> 02:52:56.842
Now what I want to do is I want
to build this structure this to

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31701-1
02:52:56.842 --> 02:52:58.919
something like this.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31720-0
02:53:01.729 --> 02:53:04.999
And this to something like this
so that they are perpendicular.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31723-0
02:53:06.039 --> 02:53:06.299
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31725-0
02:53:06.999 --> 02:53:07.509
Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31787-0
02:53:08.069 --> 02:53:11.799
So if you're given me a matrix
AI, am not sure it is positive

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31734-0
02:53:08.189 --> 02:53:08.529
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31787-1
02:53:11.799 --> 02:53:15.711
definite or symmetry, but given
any matrix A transpose, A can be

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31755-0
02:53:14.379 --> 02:53:14.659
Alright.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31787-2
02:53:15.711 --> 02:53:19.502
written as L into you because A
transpose A is symmetric and a

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31787-3
02:53:19.502 --> 02:53:21.789
transpose a positive effect,
correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31783-0
02:53:22.389 --> 02:53:22.849
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31797-0
02:53:22.949 --> 02:53:23.639
Yeah, correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31805-0
02:53:23.519 --> 02:53:28.009
So what you do is I start with a
transpose A and a transpose.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31816-0
02:53:32.559 --> 02:53:32.799
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31812-0
02:53:32.569 --> 02:53:33.399
No, no.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31821-0
02:53:33.509 --> 02:53:35.499
The catch here is why are we
doing this?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31848-0
02:53:35.569 --> 02:53:39.079
I mean, I understand that a
transpose A is always positive

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31848-1
02:53:39.079 --> 02:53:42.589
symmetric, but why A transpose a
augmented by a transpose?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31843-0
02:53:39.899 --> 02:53:40.189
Ah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31856-0
02:53:42.599 --> 02:53:43.409
Why are we taking this?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31862-0
02:53:44.759 --> 02:53:46.209
That's what I'm explaining now.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31904-0
02:53:46.519 --> 02:53:50.439
If you take a transpose and a
transpose A transpose A and a

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31904-1
02:53:50.439 --> 02:53:54.555
transpose Now this A transpose A
will be can be written as new

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31887-0
02:53:51.179 --> 02:53:51.419
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31904-2
02:53:54.555 --> 02:53:57.299
and this will be a transpose
correct now.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31903-0
02:53:55.769 --> 02:53:56.029
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31915-0
02:53:57.309 --> 02:54:00.679
So this is you is Ellen was here
transpose correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31919-0
02:54:03.289 --> 02:54:03.569
How?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31927-0
02:54:05.349 --> 02:54:05.749
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31928-0
02:54:05.389 --> 02:54:06.979
You multiply mail, transpose
Bubba.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31947-0
02:54:09.309 --> 02:54:10.129
Telling us baby.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31938-0
02:54:09.649 --> 02:54:09.939
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31940-0
02:54:09.949 --> 02:54:10.159
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31945-0
02:54:10.169 --> 02:54:11.029
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31964-0
02:54:11.039 --> 02:54:11.549
Yes, Sir. Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31961-0
02:54:11.159 --> 02:54:13.009
So you is the L inverse air
transfer.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31970-0
02:54:13.019 --> 02:54:14.129
That's what I've written here.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31982-0
02:54:14.319 --> 02:54:17.679
If you see here, Ellen was a
transpose.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31987-0
02:54:17.689 --> 02:54:17.939
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31989-0
02:54:18.609 --> 02:54:18.869
Mm-hmm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/31997-0
02:54:19.549 --> 02:54:21.739
Now this yell inverse A
transpose.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32005-0
02:54:23.359 --> 02:54:25.359
He's the orthogonal component
I'm getting.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32021-0
02:54:28.059 --> 02:54:29.979
How are we sure that it's the
orthogonal?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32024-0
02:54:31.019 --> 02:54:31.989
I'm going to prove that.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32033-0
02:54:31.999 --> 02:54:33.679
Nah, you'll show.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32031-0
02:54:33.319 --> 02:54:34.179
OK, OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32035-0
02:54:35.079 --> 02:54:35.729
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32048-0
02:54:36.039 --> 02:54:39.319
And that Q transpose is yell
inverse.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32058-0
02:54:36.299 --> 02:54:36.499
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32053-0
02:54:39.329 --> 02:54:41.829
A transpose is orthogonal
matrix.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32083-0
02:54:41.939 --> 02:54:46.224
How do you show something is
orthogonal the transpose of the

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32063-0
02:54:42.339 --> 02:54:42.659
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32075-0
02:54:45.529 --> 02:54:45.859
Uh.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32083-1
02:54:46.224 --> 02:54:50.509
matrix into that matrix should
be upper triangular, correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32085-0
02:54:51.269 --> 02:54:51.549
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32091-0
02:54:53.329 --> 02:54:54.729
Now Q transpose Q.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32106-0
02:54:54.739 --> 02:54:58.049
What kind of a matrix is Q
transpose Q for any Q symmetric?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32112-0
02:54:59.059 --> 02:54:59.329
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32110-0
02:55:00.199 --> 02:55:00.649
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32115-0
02:55:00.839 --> 02:55:01.449
Do you understand?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32125-0
02:55:01.459 --> 02:55:03.949
You transpose Q is symmetric for
any matrix Q.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32130-0
02:55:04.589 --> 02:55:04.729
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32147-0
02:55:05.829 --> 02:55:08.736
Now what is the Q transpose we
have got this is L inverse A

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32147-1
02:55:08.736 --> 02:55:09.609
transpose correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32151-0
02:55:10.239 --> 02:55:10.489
Uh-huh.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32169-0
02:55:11.189 --> 02:55:15.407
So cute transpose is L inverse A
transpose into Q which is a * L

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32169-1
02:55:15.407 --> 02:55:17.809
inverse the whole transpose
correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32180-0
02:55:20.419 --> 02:55:21.009
You didn't get it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32181-0
02:55:20.979 --> 02:55:21.309
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32183-0
02:55:21.509 --> 02:55:22.639
Yes, I got it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32188-0
02:55:23.229 --> 02:55:24.709
Yeah, it a bit.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32203-0
02:55:24.719 --> 02:55:26.549
Transpose is equals to be into a
bit.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32230-0
02:55:26.469 --> 02:55:32.133
He be transpose a transpose now
if you do this, what are you

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32213-0
02:55:26.559 --> 02:55:28.609
Transpose into a transpose,
yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32230-1
02:55:32.133 --> 02:55:34.919
going to get with a transpose?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32241-0
02:55:34.929 --> 02:55:37.769
A transpose A is basically lying
to you, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32245-0
02:55:39.129 --> 02:55:39.289
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32269-0
02:55:40.429 --> 02:55:45.859
So you put LUL inverse Lu is U *
L inverse the whole transpose.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32266-0
02:55:44.389 --> 02:55:44.589
Right.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32296-0
02:55:46.119 --> 02:55:50.755
So here you see L inverse is
going to be low triangular given

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32296-1
02:55:50.755 --> 02:55:53.149
any L inverse is lower triangle.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32311-0
02:55:53.159 --> 02:55:56.569
Correct the transpose of lower
triangular will be upper

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32298-0
02:55:53.939 --> 02:55:54.209
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32311-1
02:55:56.569 --> 02:55:57.239
triangular.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32332-0
02:55:58.129 --> 02:56:02.039
Could a great multiplication is
also an upper, upper triangular?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32339-0
02:55:59.279 --> 02:56:01.314
Upper triangular into upper
triangular is again upper

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32339-1
02:56:01.314 --> 02:56:01.729
triangular.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32336-0
02:56:02.509 --> 02:56:03.059
Great Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32347-0
02:56:03.069 --> 02:56:03.969
Yeah, got it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32364-0
02:56:03.469 --> 02:56:07.328
No Q transpose Qi have proved it
to be an upper triangular matrix

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32364-1
02:56:07.328 --> 02:56:09.609
and Q transpose Q is always
symmetric.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32369-0
02:56:10.569 --> 02:56:10.919
Hmm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32371-0
02:56:11.529 --> 02:56:12.779
Yes, symmetric matrix.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32379-0
02:56:12.789 --> 02:56:14.319
How can it be upper triangular?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32402-0
02:56:14.389 --> 02:56:17.474
It can be upper triangle only
when the off dangle elements are

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32408-0
02:56:16.809 --> 02:56:18.769
If it is in diagonal, yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32402-1
02:56:17.474 --> 02:56:17.719
zero.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32419-0
02:56:19.499 --> 02:56:22.735
So diagonal medicine, if it is a
diagonal matrix, then Q is

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32419-1
02:56:22.735 --> 02:56:23.329
orthogonal.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32431-0
02:56:27.109 --> 02:56:30.269
OK, then it can be orthonormal,
yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32428-0
02:56:27.249 --> 02:56:27.529
Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32432-0
02:56:29.909 --> 02:56:30.489
Exactly.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32435-0
02:56:32.539 --> 02:56:32.899
Great.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32442-0
02:56:33.879 --> 02:56:34.159
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32439-0
02:56:34.909 --> 02:56:35.339
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32444-0
02:56:35.389 --> 02:56:35.879
Got it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32451-0
02:56:35.929 --> 02:56:36.329
Thanks a lot.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32453-0
02:56:36.209 --> 02:56:36.559
Understood.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32458-0
02:56:37.369 --> 02:56:37.709
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32462-0
02:56:38.819 --> 02:56:39.259
Thank you, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32465-0
02:56:39.019 --> 02:56:39.569
Convincing.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32460-0
02:56:40.629 --> 02:56:41.079
Great.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32469-0
02:56:41.089 --> 02:56:42.099
So it's not convincing.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32476-0
02:56:42.149 --> 02:56:43.019
It's really great.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32473-0
02:56:42.599 --> 02:56:43.009
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32481-0

And the point is, yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32496-0
02:56:46.269 --> 02:56:46.649
Got it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32509-0
02:56:49.899 --> 02:56:50.219
Go ahead.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32513-0
02:56:50.739 --> 02:56:52.329
That said, I don't want general
questions, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32515-0
02:56:52.339 --> 02:56:52.529
Sorry.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32543-0
02:56:53.819 --> 02:56:57.959
So UM, as some of the students
are kind of having around 10

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32524-0
02:56:53.869 --> 02:56:54.129
Ah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32543-1
02:56:57.959 --> 02:56:59.409
years of experiences.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32558-0
02:56:59.419 --> 02:57:03.221
So the the the last time they
worked on the mass will be

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32558-1
02:57:03.221 --> 02:57:05.089
almost 10 plus years, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32588-0
02:57:05.099 --> 02:57:08.737
So the speed at which you're
teaching and the the grasping

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32588-1
02:57:08.737 --> 02:57:12.499
for people who are around 10
plus years will be little less.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32605-0
02:57:12.509 --> 02:57:20.588
So any are optional assignment
or TS can take at least half an

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32605-1
02:57:20.588 --> 02:57:21.999
hour to go.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32658-0
02:57:22.009 --> 02:57:25.905
Briefly explaining about the
concepts on any weekdays or any

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32658-1
02:57:25.905 --> 02:57:29.864
of the time purely optional so
that who are little behind can

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32658-2
02:57:29.864 --> 02:57:33.888
join and kind of discuss because
you're nicely explaining, but

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32658-3
02:57:33.888 --> 02:57:37.656
the grasping power is low for
some of us because it's been

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32658-4
02:57:37.656 --> 02:57:38.359
quite long.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32664-0
02:57:38.369 --> 02:57:40.279
We touched upon these concepts,
right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32678-0
02:57:40.289 --> 02:57:43.299
So you need looking for your
suggestion or any way to help.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32686-0
02:57:43.529 --> 02:57:45.929
Any ideas or something from your
side?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32689-0
02:57:47.359 --> 02:57:47.549
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32700-0
02:57:47.559 --> 02:57:49.929
Venkat Raman, you are from which
uh, area?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32708-0
02:57:50.739 --> 02:57:52.579
I'm from data engineering, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32732-0
02:57:52.679 --> 02:57:54.699
Not all you have rich place.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32725-0
02:57:52.699 --> 02:57:53.459
Data engineering.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32734-0
02:57:53.919 --> 02:57:55.499
You know which place.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32737-0
02:57:55.429 --> 02:57:56.559
I'm from Hyderabad, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32742-0
02:57:57.099 --> 02:57:57.769
Hyderabad.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32753-0
02:57:57.819 --> 02:58:00.749
OK, I I had a joke to crack.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32748-0
02:57:58.299 --> 02:57:58.519
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32760-0
02:58:01.309 --> 02:58:02.509
Oh, OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32789-0
02:58:03.399 --> 02:58:07.526
If you ask anybody, you go to
Chutney restaurant in Hyderabad

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32765-0
02:58:03.619 --> 02:58:04.059
Please do.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32789-1
02:58:07.526 --> 02:58:10.189
and you ask how are you getting
crispy?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32787-0
02:58:07.659 --> 02:58:08.819
Hmm hmm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32788-0
02:58:08.539 --> 02:58:08.899
Yeah, yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32794-0
02:58:10.199 --> 02:58:11.709
Dosa you know what?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32802-0
02:58:11.719 --> 02:58:12.619
The guy is going to tell you.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32809-0
02:58:14.399 --> 02:58:14.619
No.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32820-0
02:58:14.779 --> 02:58:16.879
That must be practice for
something else.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32822-0
02:58:16.589 --> 02:58:17.759
No, no, no, no.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32828-0
02:58:17.769 --> 02:58:19.159
Nobody tells it is part.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32833-0
02:58:19.829 --> 02:58:20.479
What is that?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32842-0
02:58:20.659 --> 02:58:23.109
I have asked some 100 cooks in
the world.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32877-0
02:58:23.439 --> 02:58:27.518
They always tell me you mix the,
you know, the right proportion

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32870-0
02:58:27.109 --> 02:58:29.329
Some nice, yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32877-1
02:58:27.518 --> 02:58:30.259
of rice and orange dog, you will
get this.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32899-0
02:58:29.419 --> 02:58:32.539
Yeah, crispy one, yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32885-0
02:58:30.449 --> 02:58:31.719
It is always not true.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32893-0
02:58:30.749 --> 02:58:31.619
Like ingredients.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32901-0
02:58:31.889 --> 02:58:34.079
Now I am also going to tell you
something like this.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32923-0
02:58:34.149 --> 02:58:39.549
If you listen to me and see me
working out the notes, then you

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32923-1
02:58:39.549 --> 02:58:41.349
know it is one thing.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32934-0
02:58:42.159 --> 02:58:45.119
The second point is to work
parallelly with me.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32950-0
02:58:45.859 --> 02:58:47.819
So when I'm writing a code, you
also write a code.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32959-0
02:58:47.829 --> 02:58:50.089
When I'm writing something on
this, you write.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32965-0
02:58:50.259 --> 02:58:51.329
I share these notes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32980-0
02:58:51.339 --> 02:58:55.779
You also go through the notes
and bug me or my tears now any

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/32980-1
02:58:55.779 --> 02:58:56.289
amount?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33017-0
02:58:56.299 --> 02:58:59.773
Because nobody knows you are
right in saying somebody has not

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33017-1
02:58:59.773 --> 02:59:02.967
done maths in the last 10 years,
15 years and so on, but

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33017-2
02:59:02.967 --> 02:59:05.489
unfortunately this is a data
science course.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33024-0
02:59:06.489 --> 02:59:06.749
Right.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33042-0
02:59:06.599 --> 02:59:08.928
So in the second semester, I
think people are going to kill

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33042-1
02:59:08.928 --> 02:59:10.869
you with the introduction to
statistical methods.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33055-0
02:59:10.879 --> 02:59:13.179
And if you're, if you're lucky,
I will not teach that course.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33068-0
02:59:14.129 --> 02:59:18.099
So we will do time series
forecasting.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33082-0
02:59:18.109 --> 02:59:22.859
So I'm going to talk about ARIMA
models, sarima models.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33106-0
02:59:23.129 --> 02:59:26.444
We are going to do multiple
regressions and in this course

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33106-1
02:59:26.444 --> 02:59:29.479
we are going to do, uh,
principal component analysis.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33115-0
02:59:29.489 --> 02:59:31.909
We able to say support vector
machine and so on.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33118-0
02:59:32.709 --> 02:59:33.509
I don't know.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33140-0
02:59:34.059 --> 02:59:37.786
And you know what to tell you to
convince you about this, but

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33140-1
02:59:37.786 --> 02:59:39.289
then you have to gear up.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33161-0
02:59:39.419 --> 02:59:42.302
Second, there is nothing like a
common denominator from where I

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33161-1
02:59:42.302 --> 02:59:44.059
can start or ask my teachers to
start.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33169-0
02:59:44.749 --> 02:59:47.119
That becomes a slight
problematic issue.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33196-0
02:59:47.129 --> 02:59:51.166
So only way to come out of it is
to work out problems and where

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33196-1
02:59:51.166 --> 02:59:52.049
you are stuck.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33203-0
02:59:52.889 --> 02:59:53.879
We are there to help you out.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33232-0
02:59:53.889 --> 02:59:56.457
So you please write an email
saying that I am not able to

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33232-1
02:59:56.457 --> 02:59:58.980
understand how you got that a
transpose A to be positive

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33232-2
02:59:58.980 --> 02:59:59.379
definite.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33307-0
02:59:59.549 --> 03:00:05.576
We can help you, but to get into
venkataramani's and file system

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33243-0
02:59:59.779 --> 03:00:01.269
OK, sure.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33307-1
03:00:05.576 --> 03:00:11.419
A slash Dave Slash Venkatraman
and get what is the problem and

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33307-2
03:00:11.419 --> 03:00:17.354
then I have I have to write the
output file system to something

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33307-3
03:00:17.354 --> 03:00:22.269
is very difficult especially
yeah you please bug me.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33293-0
03:00:19.739 --> 03:00:20.749
And then I got it, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33322-0

As I got it, sure sure.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33318-0
03:00:23.349 --> 03:00:24.199
OK, you can take.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33337-0
03:00:24.209 --> 03:00:27.939
You can take some tips and you
can take some tips from ality.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33330-0
03:00:24.679 --> 03:00:25.369
Totally agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33377-0
03:00:27.949 --> 03:00:30.552
He writes 3 meals in a day to me
and I don't know whether I'm

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33377-1
03:00:30.552 --> 03:00:33.071

him.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33367-0
03:00:33.429 --> 03:00:33.759
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33388-0

Yeah, you you responded very
fast, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33385-0
03:00:33.789 --> 03:00:34.689
Oh, first thing.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33391-0
03:00:34.699 --> 03:00:36.609
Nick totally, totally agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33413-0
03:00:37.859 --> 03:00:40.760
Totally agree with what you said
because there is also the code.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33407-0
03:00:37.929 --> 03:00:38.729
He get nude.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33420-0
03:00:39.609 --> 03:00:40.389
OK, so you.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33413-1
03:00:40.760 --> 03:00:40.939
Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33428-0
03:00:40.949 --> 03:00:43.349
You know, if you want to learn
more, you have to do math.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33434-0
03:00:43.399 --> 03:00:44.609
That is the code.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33451-0
03:00:43.899 --> 03:00:46.019
Good simple.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33453-0
03:00:44.619 --> 03:00:46.582
Basically, you know, like we
have to practice, there is no

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33457-0
03:00:45.529 --> 03:00:49.559
And unfortunately, unfortunately
are.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33453-1
03:00:46.582 --> 03:00:46.949
other code.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33477-0
03:00:49.569 --> 03:00:54.043
Fortunately, I prepare for three
3 1/2 hours on this topic before

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33477-1
03:00:54.043 --> 03:00:55.399
I come to the class.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33487-0
03:00:57.279 --> 03:00:57.549
Uh.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33507-0
03:00:57.999 --> 03:01:02.292
So it is not that I am bestowed
with some great powers that I am

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33507-1
03:01:02.292 --> 03:01:03.349
able to do this.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33510-0
03:01:03.739 --> 03:01:04.269
It is.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33539-0
03:01:04.659 --> 03:01:07.770
I worked out so today I was
doing some proofs in the

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33539-1
03:01:07.770 --> 03:01:10.529
notebook, so I have a notebook
in front of me.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33543-0
03:01:10.539 --> 03:01:11.829
I have my laptop.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33579-0
03:01:11.929 --> 03:01:15.714
I have my tablet and I have
other books surrounded in this

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33579-1
03:01:15.714 --> 03:01:19.499
place so that I am able to
deliver what it is so it is not

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33579-2
03:01:19.499 --> 03:01:21.039
something like you know.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33589-0
03:01:21.049 --> 03:01:23.559
I've been there in this trade
for last 25 years.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33621-0
03:01:23.709 --> 03:01:27.109
It hardly matters if I'm going
to come for the class today,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33621-1
03:01:27.109 --> 03:01:30.565
even see some small point I can
miss, but I don't want to do

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33621-2
03:01:30.565 --> 03:01:30.849
that.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33654-0
03:01:30.859 --> 03:01:33.732
Miss, I prepare for three hours
so that whenever I I should, I

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33654-1
03:01:33.732 --> 03:01:36.605
should at least convince you,
saying that you know this is the

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33654-2
03:01:36.605 --> 03:01:37.609
right way of doing it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33680-0
03:01:37.619 --> 03:01:41.060
And when you ask them questions,
I can always say saying that I

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33680-1
03:01:41.060 --> 03:01:43.749
have to go back, refer to my
notes and come back.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33699-0
03:01:44.079 --> 03:01:47.737
But I say that no, I should do
sincere effort to minimize such

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33699-1
03:01:47.737 --> 03:01:48.609
kind of things.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33719-0
03:01:48.999 --> 03:01:53.551
So you also prepare and if I can
do it, you can do much better

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33719-1
03:01:53.551 --> 03:01:54.129
than me.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33727-0
03:01:54.139 --> 03:01:54.489
That's my.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33754-0
03:01:55.629 --> 03:01:58.739
That's my only thing and yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33739-0
03:01:56.129 --> 03:01:56.359
Sure.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33744-0
03:01:56.549 --> 03:01:57.639
Definitely the right.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33767-0
03:01:58.069 --> 03:02:00.801
The least we can do is go
through the previous recordings

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33767-1
03:02:00.801 --> 03:02:02.639
and be familiar with what you
thought.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33790-0
03:02:02.709 --> 03:02:04.992
We should not ask the same
question again and again every

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33777-0
03:02:02.979 --> 03:02:03.139
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33801-0
03:02:03.159 --> 03:02:07.039
Yep, yeah, it wastes a lot of
time.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33790-1
03:02:04.992 --> 03:02:05.189
week.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33791-0
03:02:06.309 --> 03:02:06.899
It happens.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33795-0
03:02:06.909 --> 03:02:07.539
You can't.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33803-0
03:02:07.649 --> 03:02:09.279
This is law of large numbers.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33815-0
03:02:09.349 --> 03:02:11.639
You are bound to get that people
join late.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33864-0
03:02:10.059 --> 03:02:10.369
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33828-0
03:02:11.649 --> 03:02:13.599
They ask some questions, so that
is not a problem.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33855-0
03:02:13.609 --> 03:02:16.814
I I can spend that kind of a
time, but only thing is you see

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33855-1
03:02:16.814 --> 03:02:19.179
now I should have finished
lecture 4 by now.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33903-0
03:02:19.189 --> 03:02:23.597
But I have not even touched
lecture 4, so now I might need

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33870-0
03:02:21.699 --> 03:02:21.879
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33903-1
03:02:23.597 --> 03:02:28.155
some more time from you, give
you people to finish Lecture 4

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33903-2
03:02:28.155 --> 03:02:32.713
and I'm not started with the and
with the SVD singular value

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33903-3
03:02:32.713 --> 03:02:33.759
decomposition.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33913-0
03:02:34.109 --> 03:02:35.819
So I want to show you some
codes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33962-0
03:02:35.909 --> 03:02:39.673
I want to show some image
processing and in the class live

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33962-1
03:02:39.673 --> 03:02:43.885
with one of your images and then
tell you how image processing is

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33962-2
03:02:43.885 --> 03:02:47.522
done using singular value
decomposition so that you have

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33962-3
03:02:47.522 --> 03:02:50.139
the class is sort of excited to
do this.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33970-0
03:02:50.769 --> 03:02:52.259
OK, I have a lot of issues.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33985-0
03:02:52.269 --> 03:02:53.439
Let's see what comes through.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33989-0
03:02:54.529 --> 03:02:54.899
Hello.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34025-0
03:02:54.539 --> 03:02:54.729
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33986-0
03:02:54.619 --> 03:02:54.929
Sure.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33995-0
03:02:54.909 --> 03:02:55.939
One last question, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/33994-0
03:02:54.939 --> 03:02:55.699
So thank you.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34001-0
03:02:56.249 --> 03:02:56.609
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34014-0
03:02:57.779 --> 03:03:00.709
For all other items we have
found, the three members group.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34021-0
03:03:00.759 --> 03:03:02.389
We don't have any groups for
Max.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34026-0
03:03:02.399 --> 03:03:02.819
Right, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34027-0
03:03:03.319 --> 03:03:03.859
Yeah, correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34030-0
03:03:05.529 --> 03:03:05.789
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34049-0
03:03:05.799 --> 03:03:08.208
And individually we have to
submit the assignment for

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34049-1
03:03:08.208 --> 03:03:08.699
everything.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34063-0
03:03:08.619 --> 03:03:11.409
You already said that because
there are two things with that.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34057-0
03:03:08.709 --> 03:03:09.109
Right, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34068-0
03:03:12.919 --> 03:03:13.169
No.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34083-0
03:03:13.609 --> 03:03:16.709
I don't believe see maths is
something where you have to

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34083-1
03:03:16.709 --> 03:03:17.689
convince yourself.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34109-0
03:03:19.469 --> 03:03:22.559
And it said I like it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34089-0
03:03:19.629 --> 03:03:19.949
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34099-0
03:03:20.589 --> 03:03:20.809
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34147-0
03:03:21.379 --> 03:03:25.582
Ohh, and then at the end of the
day, if you are writing the

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34147-1
03:03:25.582 --> 03:03:29.644
answer and you know that the
answer is going to be 2, but

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34147-2
03:03:29.644 --> 03:03:33.987
somehow you are getting 1.6 as
the answer that night you will

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34147-3
03:03:33.987 --> 03:03:35.739
have some restless sleep.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34152-0
03:03:35.749 --> 03:03:36.169
You agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34155-0
03:03:36.939 --> 03:03:37.219
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34168-0
03:03:38.539 --> 03:03:42.702
Now that restlessness only will
bring in, I mean you should

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34168-1
03:03:42.702 --> 03:03:43.119
sleep.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34180-0
03:03:43.239 --> 03:03:46.129
This is what Doctor Abdul Kalam
said.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34203-0
03:03:46.139 --> 03:03:49.568
Nah, dream is not something
which will let you sleep

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34203-1
03:03:49.568 --> 03:03:52.609
peacefully, but that will never
let you sleep.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34221-0
03:03:52.859 --> 03:03:54.059
Which will not let you sleep.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34217-0
03:03:53.099 --> 03:03:54.109
You should work for it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34240-0
03:03:54.219 --> 03:03:58.060
So I want each and everyone of
you to work on the code and get

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34240-1
03:03:58.060 --> 03:03:58.609
the code.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34247-0
03:03:58.619 --> 03:03:59.929
The code is not for me.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34258-0
03:04:00.379 --> 03:04:02.229
The code is for you, yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34252-0
03:04:00.759 --> 03:04:01.149
Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34270-0
03:04:03.099 --> 03:04:06.209
Said I have one listen to hold
for creating matrix.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34283-0
03:04:04.789 --> 03:04:05.089
Soon.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34289-0
03:04:06.219 --> 03:04:09.379
We can you can we use the range
function for Python.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34292-0
03:04:10.579 --> 03:04:10.979
Of course.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34293-0
03:04:10.979 --> 03:04:12.079
No. OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34299-0
03:04:13.909 --> 03:04:14.279
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34311-0
03:04:14.049 --> 03:04:15.379
No, but how does it matter?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34316-0
03:04:14.289 --> 03:04:14.679
So I.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34333-0
03:04:14.309 --> 03:04:20.246
Creating the creation of the
matrix is is not at all there

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34320-0
03:04:15.389 --> 03:04:16.929
Even how does it even matter?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34333-1
03:04:20.246 --> 03:04:20.649
now.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34339-0
03:04:20.429 --> 03:04:20.729
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34341-0
03:04:20.659 --> 03:04:22.429
Are you guys OK with C
programming?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34369-0
03:04:23.799 --> 03:04:28.489
Stranahan, my daughter developer
that time my web developer not

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34356-0
03:04:25.539 --> 03:04:25.949
That is A.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34369-1
03:04:28.489 --> 03:04:29.369
OK with see.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34367-0
03:04:30.249 --> 03:04:30.769
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34390-0
03:04:30.689 --> 03:04:31.569
No, but see what?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34386-0
03:04:30.779 --> 03:04:32.169
Then you are OK with the Python.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34392-0
03:04:31.369 --> 03:04:33.319
So Python Python is good, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34398-0
03:04:32.439 --> 03:04:33.609
I'm going to bite down.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34408-0
03:04:33.079 --> 03:04:33.339
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34418-0
03:04:33.549 --> 03:04:34.209
Python is good.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34421-0
03:04:33.939 --> 03:04:34.889
Python is good Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34434-0
03:04:34.329 --> 03:04:37.873
Yeah, you have you all been
given that the core zero and

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34425-0
03:04:35.609 --> 03:04:36.009
Item is.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34434-1
03:04:37.873 --> 03:04:38.309
Python.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34442-0
03:04:38.549 --> 03:04:39.239
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34444-0
03:04:39.289 --> 03:04:39.839
Later.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34450-0
03:04:39.429 --> 03:04:39.829
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34448-0
03:04:39.479 --> 03:04:40.149
Yes. Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34459-0
03:04:39.599 --> 03:04:41.929
He said OK, that should be good.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34458-0
03:04:39.929 --> 03:04:40.209
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34462-0
03:04:40.159 --> 03:04:40.679
We attended.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34465-0
03:04:40.789 --> 03:04:41.249
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34469-0
03:04:41.999 --> 03:04:43.169
Enough to do these.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34476-0
03:04:43.179 --> 03:04:44.809
These are very elementary in my
opinion.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34503-0
03:04:44.819 --> 03:04:48.907
I am not expecting anything more
than a few if loops and if if

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34503-1
03:04:48.907 --> 03:04:50.919
statements and a few for loops.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34507-0
03:04:52.369 --> 03:04:52.579
Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34547-0
03:04:53.419 --> 03:04:58.392
And while I I I have not even
touched this, some structure,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34547-1
03:04:58.392 --> 03:05:03.615
linked list, etcetera, I mean
this is very elementary in terms

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34547-2
03:05:03.615 --> 03:05:08.009
of for loops and if statements
and maybe one or two.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34566-0
03:05:08.019 --> 03:05:12.149
While he's also OK to get it
done, so I don't think you

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34566-1
03:05:12.149 --> 03:05:14.509
should bother too much about it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34576-0
03:05:14.519 --> 03:05:16.479
I don't want you to use see.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34586-0
03:05:16.489 --> 03:05:20.129
Many people think that's A at
least a thing.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34632-0
03:05:22.259 --> 03:05:26.379
The comment I got saying that I
don't let you use the pre built

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34632-1
03:05:26.379 --> 03:05:30.113
it functions the built in
functions don't let you explore

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34632-2
03:05:30.113 --> 03:05:31.079
any method use.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34624-0
03:05:30.239 --> 03:05:31.169
And then what is the use?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34644-0
03:05:31.179 --> 03:05:33.219
You can write REF and you will
get the solution.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34649-0
03:05:32.809 --> 03:05:33.879
So only the.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34652-0
03:05:33.909 --> 03:05:36.159
Like the point, the point is,
what is the point?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34669-0
03:05:36.229 --> 03:05:38.679
See the point is tomorrow you
want to develop something.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34664-0
03:05:36.539 --> 03:05:36.739
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34693-0
03:05:38.689 --> 03:05:41.753
You will still be looking for,
so I find people in my

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34693-1
03:05:41.753 --> 03:05:45.159
assignment spending six hours
browsing the web for methods.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34697-0
03:05:45.169 --> 03:05:46.039
Rather, they can.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34709-0
03:05:46.369 --> 03:05:49.759
They can spend 20 minutes
writing the code by themselves.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34735-0
03:05:52.119 --> 03:05:56.607
But I think the web has uh, it
has spoiled the entire thing by,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34735-1
03:05:56.607 --> 03:05:57.519
you know you.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34746-0
03:05:57.529 --> 03:06:01.879
You have just well, well
pledging your intelligence in.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34779-0
03:06:01.919 --> 03:06:05.949
I mean, if you want some help
you want something you can even

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34779-1
03:06:05.949 --> 03:06:09.524
call me and we can discuss and
we can have a 10 minute

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34779-2
03:06:09.524 --> 03:06:12.189
discussion on how that is to be
program.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34815-0
03:06:12.199 --> 03:06:16.624
But my point is that you should
not just take something from the

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34801-0
03:06:15.119 --> 03:06:15.539
Tooth.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34815-1
03:06:16.624 --> 03:06:20.029
net where you are not the the
sole owner of that.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34820-0
03:06:20.039 --> 03:06:21.269
I mean you you own it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34826-0
03:06:21.719 --> 03:06:22.869
Let there be 10 mistakes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34832-0
03:06:22.879 --> 03:06:24.029
Let's debug it together.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34835-0
03:06:24.099 --> 03:06:24.709
No problem.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34841-0
03:06:24.719 --> 03:06:25.329
You, you.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34843-0
03:06:25.339 --> 03:06:25.909
You tell me.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34888-0
03:06:25.919 --> 03:06:28.713
I will help you debug that
program, but copying from

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34888-1
03:06:28.713 --> 03:06:32.087
somebody is not there and that
is my principle that tomorrow at

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34888-2
03:06:32.087 --> 03:06:35.461
the end of this course, whatever
marks you score, you should be

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34888-3
03:06:35.461 --> 03:06:37.359
proud owners of those marks,
right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34892-0
03:06:38.409 --> 03:06:38.669
Right.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34934-0
03:06:39.709 --> 03:06:43.074
Search so like in the
instructions it is written that

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34934-1
03:06:43.074 --> 03:06:47.063
there should be random entries
and like uh, it should be system

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34918-0
03:06:45.549 --> 03:06:45.699
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34934-2
03:06:47.063 --> 03:06:50.740
generated random number and no
marks for the deterministic

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34931-0
03:06:49.089 --> 03:06:49.239
No.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34934-3
03:06:50.740 --> 03:06:51.239
entries.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35045-0
03:06:51.329 --> 03:06:56.118
So for random number like when
we when we calculate like REF or

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34941-0
03:06:51.409 --> 03:06:51.589
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35045-1
03:06:56.118 --> 03:07:00.533
RREF like even programmatically
like if even if we write a

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/34957-0
03:06:56.889 --> 03:06:57.169
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35045-2
03:07:00.533 --> 03:07:04.649
program right like are we
supposed to write the actual

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35045-3
03:07:04.649 --> 03:07:09.438
values or the calculated values
at every step or is it just the

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35045-4
03:07:09.438 --> 03:07:14.077
logic that OK like doesn't like
R 2 -, 2, R one or like those

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35045-5
03:07:14.077 --> 03:07:18.492
kind of logics we need to be
writing in the program in the

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35028-0
03:07:16.909 --> 03:07:17.309
Bit.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35045-6
03:07:18.492 --> 03:07:22.309
programs or in the code snippet
in the assignment.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35042-0
03:07:23.219 --> 03:07:23.549
No, no.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35048-0
03:07:23.559 --> 03:07:24.769
In which part you're asking?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35076-0
03:07:26.109 --> 03:07:29.483
So or in assignment where like
this code snippet is being

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35066-0
03:07:29.179 --> 03:07:30.389
I I I agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35076-1
03:07:29.483 --> 03:07:29.949
desired.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35072-0
03:07:30.439 --> 03:07:31.089
Yeah, you. I are.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35118-0
03:07:31.099 --> 03:07:35.637
You are you seeing something in
front of you in one sea for see

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35100-0
03:07:32.109 --> 03:07:34.099
Once he, once it's a once.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35118-1
03:07:35.637 --> 03:07:39.679
one see is basically how your
program one and 1B, right.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35122-0
03:07:40.849 --> 03:07:41.119
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35134-0
03:07:41.579 --> 03:07:45.199
You have written a code where
you want to do REF and RREF.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35173-0
03:07:46.319 --> 03:07:51.125
Once you write a code for
general A of size M Cross north

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35173-1
03:07:51.125 --> 03:07:56.181
and for a general vector B and
that and for M less than yen,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35173-2
03:07:56.181 --> 03:08:00.159
you write the code in general
sense for REF RF.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35209-0
03:08:01.899 --> 03:08:06.655
Once you do that as a particular
case, you ask A equal to Rand of

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35209-1
03:08:06.655 --> 03:08:10.908
five, Cross 7, whatever it is,
and B is a Rand of for five

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35209-2
03:08:10.908 --> 03:08:11.629
cross one.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35214-0
03:08:12.229 --> 03:08:14.549
I think you should get REF.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35247-0
03:08:14.559 --> 03:08:18.573
RREF pivot columns, non pivot
columns everything printed out

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35247-1
03:08:18.573 --> 03:08:22.719
there and this is independent of
what kind of matrix you give.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35257-0
03:08:22.729 --> 03:08:26.679
But don't give 123 minus 147,
etcetera.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35283-0
03:08:26.769 --> 03:08:30.964
You make it random so that you
will be able to learn something

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35283-1
03:08:30.964 --> 03:08:35.026
and it should not be that for
your particular example things

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35283-2
03:08:35.026 --> 03:08:35.759
work right.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35344-0
03:08:38.899 --> 03:08:43.736
Yes, so code snippet we have to
make like we have to submit this

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35344-1
03:08:43.736 --> 03:08:48.350
assignment as like a handwritten
so like it is going to be OK

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35344-2
03:08:48.350 --> 03:08:52.444
whatever code snippet we
produce, we write it on paper

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35344-3
03:08:52.444 --> 03:08:54.379
and then we scan it right.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35335-0
03:08:53.009 --> 03:08:53.639
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35348-0
03:08:53.689 --> 03:08:56.569
Hey, once again you, you do you
understand the code snippet?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35358-0
03:08:58.769 --> 03:08:59.729
Yes, I'm sudocode.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35370-0
03:09:00.509 --> 03:09:05.299
It it it very small part of code
which does exactly the.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35399-0
03:09:05.339 --> 03:09:10.005
So if I give a matrix A which is
of size M cross N, can you write

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35399-1
03:09:10.005 --> 03:09:13.399
5 to 6 lines of code where I
generate the RREF?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35407-0
03:09:14.239 --> 03:09:14.369
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35408-0
03:09:15.339 --> 03:09:15.779
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35409-0
03:09:15.399 --> 03:09:16.239
That's what I require.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35436-0
03:09:17.909 --> 03:09:21.937
Can you write once you get the
RREF you can write maybe 4-5

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35436-1
03:09:21.937 --> 03:09:24.489
lines of code to get the RREF.
Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35439-0
03:09:24.989 --> 03:09:25.229
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35471-0
03:09:26.649 --> 03:09:30.675
Now once you know RF, you go
column by column to identify

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35471-1
03:09:30.675 --> 03:09:34.979
whether it is going to be pivot
column or a non pivot column.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35477-0
03:09:35.369 --> 03:09:36.199
You keep a count.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35480-0
03:09:35.699 --> 03:09:37.639
Umm. Correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35482-0
03:09:38.209 --> 03:09:40.109
Can you print them? Agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35502-0
03:09:41.159 --> 03:09:41.439
Alright.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35496-0
03:09:42.089 --> 03:09:43.299
No, that's what is required.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35512-0
03:09:43.309 --> 03:09:47.226
Now I don't know why people are
so stressed about what kind of

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35512-1
03:09:47.226 --> 03:09:48.159
entries he has.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35538-0
03:09:49.329 --> 03:09:52.740
I am writing a program where if
you give the link and height of

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35538-1
03:09:52.740 --> 03:09:56.259
a triangle right angle triangle,
I'm going to calculate the area.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35564-0
03:09:56.269 --> 03:10:00.113
So I'm going to write a input
length, a input height area

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35564-1
03:10:00.113 --> 03:10:02.699
equal to half into length into
height.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35567-0
03:10:03.109 --> 03:10:03.629
That's it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35582-0
03:10:03.949 --> 03:10:06.229
Now, whatever length and
whatever height you're going to

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35582-1
03:10:06.229 --> 03:10:06.429
give.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35589-0
03:10:07.389 --> 03:10:08.689
Uh, I think it is.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35610-0
03:10:08.699 --> 03:10:11.260
What a calculate half into the
first quantity into the second

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35610-1
03:10:11.260 --> 03:10:12.459
quantity and give the answer.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35620-0
03:10:12.469 --> 03:10:14.479
Right now, we've been no.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35635-0
03:10:13.339 --> 03:10:17.639
Yeah, basically it should be
general, but before.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35637-0
03:10:15.669 --> 03:10:17.359
Yeah, it is generic code.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35653-0
03:10:17.689 --> 03:10:18.949
Yeah, yeah, don't record.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35639-0
03:10:18.449 --> 03:10:18.829
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35660-0
03:10:18.839 --> 03:10:21.059
And the in case tomorrow you you
don't want.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35692-0
03:10:21.129 --> 03:10:25.912
I mean you want to check what is
it running time complexity of

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35692-1
03:10:25.912 --> 03:10:30.316
this REF RREF and you want to
give 25,000 cross 25,000 or

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35692-2
03:10:30.316 --> 03:10:31.379
30,000 matrix.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35710-0
03:10:31.769 --> 03:10:34.587
I think you should give it and
plot the time just for the for

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35710-1
03:10:34.587 --> 03:10:35.269
the heck of it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35719-0
03:10:36.179 --> 03:10:36.329
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35737-0
03:10:36.819 --> 03:10:39.328
Weather checked whether it is
order of two by three NQ because

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35737-1
03:10:39.328 --> 03:10:41.359
it's anyway Gaussian elimination
procedure, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35747-0
03:10:41.999 --> 03:10:42.439
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35771-0
03:10:42.919 --> 03:10:45.967
No, I'm check with the order of
two by three and Cube and say

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35771-1
03:10:45.967 --> 03:10:48.966
whether your computer is slow or
mind calculations are wrong

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35771-2
03:10:48.966 --> 03:10:49.409
etcetera.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35775-0
03:10:50.739 --> 03:10:50.949
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35786-0
03:10:52.159 --> 03:10:54.229
That's what makes things
interesting, in my opinion.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35792-0
03:10:55.039 --> 03:10:55.409
Speak.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35807-0
03:10:55.209 --> 03:10:57.979
It's a so this code snippet will
be handwritten right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35804-0
03:10:55.419 --> 03:10:56.329
I think I have spoken.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35809-0
03:10:56.249 --> 03:10:56.769
I agree.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35816-0
03:10:57.989 --> 03:10:58.919
So like what?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35827-0
03:10:58.919 --> 03:11:00.969
100% that.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35837-0
03:10:58.929 --> 03:11:03.129
I'm confused about OK and in one
see right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35834-0
03:11:02.009 --> 03:11:02.169
And.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35845-0
03:11:03.139 --> 03:11:06.159
Like in 1C it is going to be
random metrics, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35871-0
03:11:06.169 --> 03:11:11.220
So this random metrics will be
basically like this will be we

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35849-0
03:11:06.579 --> 03:11:06.799
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35871-1
03:11:11.220 --> 03:11:14.479
will be generating via code only
right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35889-0
03:11:14.539 --> 03:11:15.449
Hey, why port only?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35902-0
03:11:14.539 --> 03:11:20.269
So so of this 1C will also be
handwritten like we.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35921-0
03:11:17.769 --> 03:11:17.999
But.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35903-0
03:11:19.929 --> 03:11:21.919
100 wounded, 100%.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35912-0
03:11:21.929 --> 03:11:26.149
I have written very clearly
figures and 10 tables.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35935-0
03:11:26.409 --> 03:11:29.035
Suppose I mean we are going to
do something called as a power

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35935-1
03:11:29.035 --> 03:11:30.179
method in next two classes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35947-0
03:11:30.599 --> 03:11:33.499
When I do power method it will
have some 100 iterations.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35967-0
03:11:33.759 --> 03:11:36.850
When we do the gradient descent
approach for machine learning,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35967-1
03:11:36.850 --> 03:11:38.519
it will have some 100
iterations.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35984-0
03:11:39.049 --> 03:11:41.842
Those hundred iterations, if I
ask you in the assignment, you

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/35984-1
03:11:41.842 --> 03:11:43.059
can cut and paste the code.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36011-0
03:11:43.659 --> 03:11:46.348
And of course, snippets
somewhere and then you can

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36011-1
03:11:46.348 --> 03:11:49.722
generate the table and table can
be pasted because it will have

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36011-2
03:11:49.722 --> 03:11:50.619
some 500 entries.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36020-0
03:11:51.149 --> 03:11:52.839
This will have very less
entries, no?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36067-0
03:11:54.509 --> 03:11:57.731
So you will write the five cross
seven matrix, you will write

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36034-0
03:11:54.899 --> 03:11:55.069
So.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36067-1
03:11:57.731 --> 03:12:00.901
another five cross seven matrix
which is a REF, another five

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36067-2
03:12:00.901 --> 03:12:03.967
cross and which is a RREF you
will say first column, third

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36067-3
03:12:03.967 --> 03:12:05.579
column, 5th column, 6th column.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36078-0
03:12:05.589 --> 03:12:07.539
These are the pivot columns.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36092-0
03:12:07.549 --> 03:12:10.259
There the remaining columns are
the non pivot columns.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36102-0
03:12:10.269 --> 03:12:13.579
There solution of X equal to 0
is governed by these two.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36105-0
03:12:13.689 --> 03:12:14.179
That's it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36114-0
03:12:14.629 --> 03:12:16.299
And then you have got 1C2 marks.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36120-0
03:12:19.299 --> 03:12:20.289
So, so.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36125-0
03:12:19.899 --> 03:12:20.059
So.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36131-0
03:12:20.349 --> 03:12:23.169
So suppose we were given a
matrix A.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36138-0
03:12:23.519 --> 03:12:23.699
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36154-0
03:12:23.659 --> 03:12:26.587
What is the process to find out
Lu like we should write a is

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36154-1
03:12:26.587 --> 03:12:27.739
equal to tell you right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36172-0
03:12:28.739 --> 03:12:32.529
So how do we get L and you like
we can use any method, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36189-0
03:12:32.679 --> 03:12:33.909
You had given like 3 methods.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36181-0
03:12:33.039 --> 03:12:33.569
Yeah, you can.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36197-0
03:12:33.579 --> 03:12:36.392
You can see that depends whether
if you are using dual little

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36197-1
03:12:36.392 --> 03:12:37.709
method whether you are using.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36213-0
03:12:39.639 --> 03:12:42.199
Crowds method or you are using
cholesky's method?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36231-0
03:12:42.569 --> 03:12:45.122
If A is symmetric and possibly
different, you can use all the

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36225-0
03:12:42.839 --> 03:12:43.059
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36231-1
03:12:45.122 --> 03:12:45.699
three methods.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36255-0
03:12:46.209 --> 03:12:51.909
OK, now one way I told you was
to write L and write U and do by

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36241-0
03:12:47.279 --> 03:12:47.479
Mm-hmm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36255-1
03:12:51.909 --> 03:12:53.869
direct multiplication.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36261-0
03:12:53.919 --> 03:12:55.339
The same thing you can algorithm
is.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36276-0
03:13:00.529 --> 03:13:01.919
Can can you give me the steps?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36284-0
03:13:01.929 --> 03:13:03.439
I mean, I don't need a code.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36300-0
03:13:03.449 --> 03:13:06.239
Can we have a small example is
equal to tell you for the

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36300-1
03:13:06.239 --> 03:13:06.729
Doolittle?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36315-0
03:13:07.639 --> 03:13:10.233
Yeah, I did not actually show
you that example you're seeing

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36315-1
03:13:10.233 --> 03:13:10.659
my screen.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36322-0
03:13:11.249 --> 03:13:11.569
Yes, yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36325-0
03:13:12.719 --> 03:13:13.279
I'll show you.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36331-0
03:13:14.329 --> 03:13:15.219
I did hear now.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36352-0
03:13:15.709 --> 03:13:17.939
Uh, Lucy, I did.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36349-0
03:13:17.029 --> 03:13:18.759
We can work again, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36357-0
03:13:19.619 --> 03:13:21.789
1225 is my matrix.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36350-0
03:13:20.339 --> 03:13:20.769
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36359-0
03:13:20.779 --> 03:13:21.119
Yeah, yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36381-0
03:13:22.279 --> 03:13:25.344
I have written 1 lower
triangular matrix L and one

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36388-0
03:13:22.739 --> 03:13:23.009
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36381-1
03:13:25.344 --> 03:13:27.929
upper triangular matrix U1225IS
symmetric.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36400-0
03:13:27.939 --> 03:13:30.789
It is positive definite, so I'm
writing it as L into you.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36398-0
03:13:29.549 --> 03:13:29.709
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36403-0
03:13:30.919 --> 03:13:31.849
You multiply.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36425-0
03:13:32.179 --> 03:13:36.408
You will generally find the
first row of you and the first

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36425-1
03:13:36.408 --> 03:13:38.559
row of A are one and the same.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36429-0
03:13:39.409 --> 03:13:39.829
That.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36453-0
03:13:40.839 --> 03:13:44.718
So you can directly copy one and
two there and then you are you

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36450-0
03:13:43.649 --> 03:13:43.769
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36453-1
03:13:44.718 --> 03:13:45.809
are left with L21.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36465-0
03:13:45.819 --> 03:13:49.009
You multiply the 2nd row of L
with the first column of you.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36489-0
03:13:49.499 --> 03:13:53.784
You will get L21 and then you
multiply the 2nd row of URL with

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36489-1
03:13:53.784 --> 03:13:55.349
the second column of U.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36495-0
03:13:55.359 --> 03:13:57.189
You will get U22.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36508-0
03:13:57.519 --> 03:13:58.189
It's very simple.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36522-0
03:13:57.949 --> 03:14:03.002
OK, so the same process what we
are writing by hand, we need to

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36522-1
03:14:03.002 --> 03:14:05.529
program it right, that's it, OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36521-0
03:14:03.829 --> 03:14:04.359
Yeah, correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36535-0
03:14:07.809 --> 03:14:09.959
So can you please explain the 2C
question?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36546-0
03:14:10.029 --> 03:14:11.649
I mean, I'm not getting the
question itself.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36564-0
03:14:12.549 --> 03:14:16.024
Uh, given an linearly
independent vectors and I'm

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36553-0
03:14:12.889 --> 03:14:13.379
Who is it?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36564-1
03:14:16.024 --> 03:14:16.789
dimensions?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36569-0
03:14:18.279 --> 03:14:20.419
Who was he given non young?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36573-0
03:14:20.759 --> 03:14:21.709
No, no have you.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36581-0
03:14:25.009 --> 03:14:26.449
What is 2C question?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36585-0
03:14:26.939 --> 03:14:27.299
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36595-0
03:14:28.649 --> 03:14:30.975
I have asked you to learn
something about QR

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36595-1
03:14:30.975 --> 03:14:31.699
decomposition.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36598-0
03:14:33.609 --> 03:14:33.869
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36606-0
03:14:35.199 --> 03:14:38.169
Now please take linear algebra.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36620-0
03:14:38.179 --> 03:14:40.688
Any book on linear algebra and
do something called QR

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36620-1
03:14:40.688 --> 03:14:41.339
decomposition.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36625-0
03:14:42.119 --> 03:14:42.449
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36642-0
03:14:42.689 --> 03:14:46.473
They're just Q is an orthogonal
matrix and R is an upper

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36642-1
03:14:46.473 --> 03:14:47.669
triangular matrix.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36652-0
03:14:48.749 --> 03:14:49.129
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36659-0
03:14:49.059 --> 03:14:51.909
Now we will not be able to do
all the matrix decomposes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36676-0
03:14:51.919 --> 03:14:55.448
So I gave one as homework for
for me to see how you are doing

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36676-1
03:14:55.448 --> 03:14:56.189
this problem.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36679-0
03:14:56.969 --> 03:14:57.709
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36685-0
03:14:57.749 --> 03:14:59.259
OK. OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36690-0
03:14:58.389 --> 03:14:59.969
OK, basically it is very simple.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36702-0
03:15:01.229 --> 03:15:03.869
OK, this will be founded that
Gilbert's textbook. Right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36717-0
03:15:03.879 --> 03:15:04.639
The QR disk.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36710-0
03:15:04.029 --> 03:15:05.199
Yeah, yeah, of course.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36724-0
03:15:05.249 --> 03:15:07.119
Any other textbook online
resources?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36731-0
03:15:07.129 --> 03:15:09.039
You just write your
decomposition of a matrix.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36737-0
03:15:09.839 --> 03:15:10.209
Umm.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36746-0
03:15:11.029 --> 03:15:11.609
You will get it.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36748-0
03:15:12.269 --> 03:15:13.339
OK, Sir, we'll do that.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36754-0
03:15:13.389 --> 03:15:14.499
OK, fine.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36750-0
03:15:13.409 --> 03:15:13.879
Thanks.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36761-0
03:15:14.249 --> 03:15:14.569
Thank you.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36772-0
03:15:14.369 --> 03:15:19.619
So I have one query in 1A
question 1A.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36766-0
03:15:14.679 --> 03:15:15.389
And if you yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36775-0
03:15:18.629 --> 03:15:18.789
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36800-0
03:15:21.689 --> 03:15:26.301
Uh, so you said, if in case you
encounter any division by zero,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36800-1
03:15:26.301 --> 03:15:28.319
you can choose different AI.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36798-0
03:15:26.719 --> 03:15:26.879
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36805-0
03:15:28.329 --> 03:15:29.519
Didn't understand this concept.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36843-0
03:15:29.529 --> 03:15:33.719
I mean if if the if if it's a
row two and row one if row one

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36843-1
03:15:33.719 --> 03:15:37.910
element is 0 then we can just
interchange with any row which

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36836-0
03:15:36.119 --> 03:15:36.299
Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36843-2
03:15:37.910 --> 03:15:39.559
which is nonzero, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36864-0
03:15:39.569 --> 03:15:40.579
Why do you have to choose?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36855-0
03:15:39.699 --> 03:15:40.629
No, no, no, don't.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36858-0
03:15:40.639 --> 03:15:41.069
Don't do.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36861-0
03:15:41.079 --> 03:15:41.799
Don't do that.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36871-0
03:15:42.019 --> 03:15:43.549
That is called partial pivoting.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36884-0
03:15:43.559 --> 03:15:47.645
Since I have not told you about
that, what I'm saying is

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36884-1
03:15:47.645 --> 03:15:48.219
suppose.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36895-0
03:15:52.009 --> 03:15:54.739
Suppose you have a matrix, let's
say.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36901-0
03:15:55.049 --> 03:15:55.519
Zero.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36909-0
03:15:56.779 --> 03:15:58.509
So this is a 11.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36912-0
03:15:58.579 --> 03:15:59.849
This is a 12.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36918-0
03:16:00.159 --> 03:16:01.229
This is a 21.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36946-0
03:16:01.239 --> 03:16:07.054
This is a two, so typically you
will say R2 goes to R 2 -, A

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36946-1
03:16:07.054 --> 03:16:09.629
two, one by A11R1, correct?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36950-0
03:16:11.759 --> 03:16:12.309
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36956-0
03:16:12.439 --> 03:16:12.729
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36973-0
03:16:12.889 --> 03:16:18.229
Now this is valid as long as you
A11 is not equal to 0, correct.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36977-0
03:16:18.969 --> 03:16:19.369
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/36990-0
03:16:20.289 --> 03:16:23.859
But the moment A11 is 0, you
cannot proceed with this.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/37001-0
03:16:23.869 --> 03:16:26.419
It will give something the
computer will say that it is.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/37013-0
03:16:27.349 --> 03:16:30.349
And yeah, NONINF right.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/37019-0
03:16:31.109 --> 03:16:31.529
Yes, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/37042-0
03:16:32.409 --> 03:16:36.203
So what I'm saying is you choose
whenever you get this A11 to be

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/37042-1
03:16:36.203 --> 03:16:38.539
0 or close to 0, choose another
matrix.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/37046-0
03:16:40.539 --> 03:16:40.929
Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/37054-0
03:16:40.939 --> 03:16:42.749
So I've already written a
solution.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/37090-0
03:16:42.759 --> 03:16:47.439
So what I'm doing is if A11 is
0, I'll exchange A to a second

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/37090-1
03:16:47.439 --> 03:16:52.119
row with first row and then go
ahead, assuming that at one is

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/37090-2
03:16:52.119 --> 03:16:52.799
not zero.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/37099-0
03:16:52.899 --> 03:16:53.459
Is that OK?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/37109-0
03:16:53.259 --> 03:16:57.109
But that's the point is it has
to be done at every stage, no?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/37113-0
03:16:58.309 --> 03:16:58.449
Yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/37118-0
03:16:59.649 --> 03:17:01.199
That becomes a problematic
issue.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/37139-0
03:17:01.209 --> 03:17:04.596
So you change the matrix itself,
change the because you have to

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/37139-1
03:17:04.596 --> 03:17:06.819
write the code for whatever I
have given.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/37147-0
03:17:06.829 --> 03:17:09.049
Now don't exchange it to any
other room.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/37162-0
03:17:12.119 --> 03:17:13.019
Oh, OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/37182-0
03:17:13.019 --> 03:17:15.592
Then never you get into the
problem, you generate a new

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/37182-1
03:17:15.592 --> 03:17:18.303
matrix, not every time you're
going to get the same thing,

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/37182-2
03:17:18.303 --> 03:17:18.579
right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/37185-0
03:17:19.319 --> 03:17:19.959
Yes, yes.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/37199-0
03:17:20.929 --> 03:17:23.799
So you can generate another
meetings and try with that.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/37205-0
03:17:24.309 --> 03:17:25.459
It is a while loop, right?

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/37217-0
03:17:25.499 --> 03:17:30.609
While this is not uh, this is
not the criteria.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/37225-0
03:17:30.619 --> 03:17:32.259
You do this so that is not a
problem.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/37232-0
03:17:34.339 --> 03:17:35.209
OK, OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/37233-0
03:17:35.479 --> 03:17:35.929
OK.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/37237-0
03:17:36.339 --> 03:17:37.229
OK, fine.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/37242-0
03:17:37.279 --> 03:17:37.739
All the best.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/37245-0
03:17:38.649 --> 03:17:38.989
Thank you.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/37253-0
03:17:39.629 --> 03:17:40.029
Thank you.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/37249-0
03:17:40.839 --> 03:17:41.409
Thank you, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/37258-0
03:17:41.419 --> 03:17:41.839
Thanks a lot.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/37262-0
03:17:41.799 --> 03:17:42.179
Thank you.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/37266-0
03:17:43.159 --> 03:17:44.029
Thank you so much, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/37277-0
03:17:43.709 --> 03:17:44.759
Thank you so much Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/37289-0
03:17:44.039 --> 03:17:45.389
Just want to appreciate how you
take your.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/37285-0
03:17:44.419 --> 03:17:44.999
Thank you, Sir.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/37288-0
03:17:44.769 --> 03:17:45.369
Thank you. Yeah.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/37313-0
03:17:46.289 --> 03:17:49.429
Thank you said that's that's a
job for which I'm working.

57914ff1-d4b9-482e-8c33-c16ffa92795b/37308-0
03:17:47.949 --> 03:17:48.449
Thank you.
