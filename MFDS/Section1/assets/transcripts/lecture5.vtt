00:00:04.406 --> 00:00:05.166
Go to 11.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/127-0
00:00:07.436 --> 00:00:11.412
I think you can go parallelly
with me if you go to heal and

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/127-1
00:00:11.412 --> 00:00:15.720
portal you will go to my courses
and if you go to my courses you

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/127-2
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.046
will find somewhere.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/144-0
00:00:17.676 --> 00:00:22.666
And something called this S 123
DSECLZG C416.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/148-0
00:00:22.676 --> 00:00:23.726
Go to course page.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/171-0
00:00:25.876 --> 00:00:29.800
So if you're in this part of the
world, then you come to modules

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/171-1
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.826
on the left side.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/174-0
00:00:30.836 --> 00:00:31.636
Do you find modules?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/179-0
00:00:35.326 --> 00:00:35.526
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/191-0
00:00:35.676 --> 00:00:35.946
Yeah, yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/192-0
00:00:35.686 --> 00:00:36.326
Yeah, we do.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/206-0
00:00:36.976 --> 00:00:41.343
Yeah, just click on modules so
you'll find all these LECTURES

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/206-1
00:00:41.343 --> 00:00:41.766
there.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/225-0
00:00:41.776 --> 00:00:45.386
You you go to lecture one for
example, you will see lecture.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/227-0
00:00:45.396 --> 00:00:46.456
One slides here down.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/242-0
00:00:50.626 --> 00:00:53.026
You click on this you will get
lecture one agree.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/250-0
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:54.786
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/260-0
00:00:55.706 --> 00:00:58.436
So you can get lecture 1234, et
cetera.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/279-0
00:00:58.446 --> 00:01:01.915
Here this uploaded for the 5th
lecture for Saturdays Lecture

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/279-1
00:01:01.915 --> 00:01:02.996
also this uploaded.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/294-0
00:01:03.186 --> 00:01:05.726
So wherever you find a tick,
these are all uploaded loads OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/291-0
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:04.326
Yeah, it is.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/305-0
00:01:07.296 --> 00:01:09.846
And and VENKATA one more
request.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/309-0
00:01:09.986 --> 00:01:10.556
Uh.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/314-0
00:01:10.026 --> 00:01:10.286
Ah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/337-0
00:01:10.696 --> 00:01:14.281
The slides which are being in
the canvas and the slides which

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/337-1
00:01:14.281 --> 00:01:17.346
are using in the LECTURES are
seems to be different.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/352-0
00:01:17.356 --> 00:01:19.866
So can we make sure that both
are same?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/360-0
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:23.076
Ohh, last time there was one
sink problem.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/390-0
00:01:23.946 --> 00:01:28.553
And so there is a whatever I'm
using, whatever I'm correcting,

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/365-0
00:01:24.216 --> 00:01:24.776
Achacha.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/390-1
00:01:28.553 --> 00:01:32.136
but typically it doesn't have
happened that way.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/384-0
00:01:29.746 --> 00:01:30.106
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/395-0
00:01:32.886 --> 00:01:33.656
OK, OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/413-0
00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:37.854
In 3rd in 3rd lecture itself,
there is one more issue but

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/403-0
00:01:34.186 --> 00:01:34.346
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/413-1
00:01:37.854 --> 00:01:38.206
fine.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/428-0
00:01:39.436 --> 00:01:40.886
OK, now only third lecture.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/440-0
00:01:41.496 --> 00:01:42.736
Yeah, only in the third lecture.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/452-0
00:01:41.536 --> 00:01:44.503
In other LECTURES you will not
have that because I sync with a

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/442-0
00:01:43.766 --> 00:01:43.986
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/450-0
00:01:43.996 --> 00:01:44.416
Yeah, it's fine.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/452-1
00:01:44.503 --> 00:01:45.256
different thing.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/467-0
00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:51.716
OK, so VENKATA said you mean to
say this Lu decomposition.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/479-0
00:01:51.726 --> 00:01:55.046
Everything are part of Gram
Schmidt process, right?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/481-0
00:01:55.286 --> 00:01:55.536
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/486-0
00:01:55.546 --> 00:01:55.926
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/515-0
00:01:57.476 --> 00:02:00.324
If you are there with the
symmetric positive definite

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/494-0
00:01:57.686 --> 00:01:57.966
And.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/515-1
00:02:00.324 --> 00:02:03.436
matrix, you are very sure and
then I am going to show that

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/515-2
00:02:03.436 --> 00:02:04.966
this queue is orthogonal. Uh.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/520-0
00:02:05.156 --> 00:02:05.376
Uh-huh.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/532-0
00:02:06.666 --> 00:02:09.306
So to do that I need this
symmetric positive definite

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/532-1
00:02:09.306 --> 00:02:09.746
property.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/533-0
00:02:10.676 --> 00:02:11.486
OK, OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/562-0
00:02:11.496 --> 00:02:14.780
So basically these are under
scraps Smith process only gram

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/551-0
00:02:14.726 --> 00:02:15.336
Yeah, correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/562-1
00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:15.546
Smith process.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/581-0
00:02:15.346 --> 00:02:18.630
In the in the in the in the
webinar we are going to do some

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/581-1
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.079
UH-23 problems where I'm going
to give an alternative approach

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/581-2
00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:22.736
to graphite.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/585-0
00:02:23.696 --> 00:02:24.286
Great.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/612-0
00:02:24.636 --> 00:02:29.282
And so just last thing, I have a
statement, just let me know if

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/590-0
00:02:24.946 --> 00:02:25.086
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/599-0
00:02:26.756 --> 00:02:27.306
Yeah, sure, sure.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/612-1
00:02:29.282 --> 00:02:30.806
it is right or wrong.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/631-0
00:02:31.056 --> 00:02:34.359
The properties applicable for
orthonormal matrix are also

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/618-0
00:02:31.396 --> 00:02:31.556
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/631-1
00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:36.296
applicable for orthogonal
matrix.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/636-0
00:02:36.876 --> 00:02:37.316
Character.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/641-0
00:02:38.386 --> 00:02:39.466
The reverse is also true.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/648-0
00:02:40.906 --> 00:02:42.516
Uh, it depends upon what
property.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/680-0
00:02:42.526 --> 00:02:45.306
See for example, if you if
you're looking at the property

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/680-1
00:02:45.306 --> 00:02:48.327
saying that the the length of
each vector each column is going

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/680-2
00:02:48.327 --> 00:02:48.806
to be one.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/683-0
00:02:49.676 --> 00:02:49.846
Umm.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/709-0
00:02:49.746 --> 00:02:54.480
That is, that is there only for
ortho normal vectors or

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/709-1
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.806
matrices, but it is not there
for orthogonal matrices, so you.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/704-0
00:02:58.356 --> 00:02:59.046
Correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/710-0
00:02:59.476 --> 00:03:01.226
Let's say uh.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/734-0
00:03:01.276 --> 00:03:03.599
A transpose is equal to a
inverse and all these are

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/734-1
00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:04.806
applicable for both, right?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/737-0
00:03:05.086 --> 00:03:06.686
Yeah, yeah, these are applicable
to both.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/759-0
00:03:06.726 --> 00:03:10.374
Only thing which is more is that
you are going to get that the

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/749-0
00:03:07.506 --> 00:03:07.916
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/759-1
00:03:10.374 --> 00:03:11.416
norm of each link.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/780-0
00:03:11.426 --> 00:03:14.105
Each vector is going to be
column vector is going to be one

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/780-1
00:03:14.105 --> 00:03:16.426
for orthonormal, but it is not
true for orthogonal.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/781-0
00:03:17.256 --> 00:03:17.786
Correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/786-0
00:03:17.856 --> 00:03:18.386
Correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/798-0
00:03:18.436 --> 00:03:19.406
Yeah. Thanks.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/814-0
00:03:18.656 --> 00:03:22.313
In general it is not there, but
you can also again in an

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/814-1
00:03:22.313 --> 00:03:25.456
orthonormal matrix is also an
orthogonal matrix.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/815-0
00:03:26.386 --> 00:03:27.496
Correct. Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/819-0
00:03:27.566 --> 00:03:27.816
Thanks.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/825-0
00:03:27.826 --> 00:03:28.586
Yeah, makes sense.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/866-0
00:03:29.076 --> 00:03:33.794
Sir, little doubt regarding the
terms in the slides and in the

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/841-0
00:03:32.686 --> 00:03:32.846
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/866-1
00:03:33.794 --> 00:03:38.063
textbook it is written, the
orthogonal matrix is columns

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/866-2
00:03:38.063 --> 00:03:42.856
having orthonormal and nowhere
orthonormal matrix is mentioned.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/869-0
00:03:44.146 --> 00:03:44.396
Uh.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/873-0
00:03:45.836 --> 00:03:46.166
Is that?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/876-0
00:03:46.176 --> 00:03:46.686
Is that right?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/890-0
00:03:46.696 --> 00:03:50.192
I mean, there's no orthonormal
matrix orthogonal matrix columns

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/890-1
00:03:50.192 --> 00:03:51.066
are orthonormal.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/901-0
00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:53.556
That's how the definition is
given, isn't that right?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/933-0
00:03:55.326 --> 00:04:00.516
Ohh and if the books talks about
orthogonal in general, you see

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/933-1
00:04:00.516 --> 00:04:05.220
we added this orthonormal thing
because in some things we

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/933-2
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.436
normalize that.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/949-0
00:04:07.356 --> 00:04:09.975
I'm going to do something, or at
least I will pass on certain

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/949-1
00:04:09.975 --> 00:04:11.496
things with respect to
projections.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/952-0
00:04:15.936 --> 00:04:16.236
So.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/979-0
00:04:20.376 --> 00:04:22.703
At that time, I will try to tell
you how this orthonormal is

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/979-1
00:04:22.703 --> 00:04:25.106
going to be created, but don't
don't worry about those things.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/991-0
00:04:25.376 --> 00:04:28.576
Maybe I should start with
writing that can write it down.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1003-0
00:04:33.956 --> 00:04:34.386
Yeah, sure.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1004-0
00:04:34.986 --> 00:04:35.956
Like I said, please please.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1046-0
00:04:42.536 --> 00:04:48.163
Now, if you have a matrix A and
you have a one as the first

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1046-1
00:04:48.163 --> 00:04:53.696
column, A2 as a second column
and up to GANESAN to column.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1065-0
00:04:55.676 --> 00:05:02.268
If I thought AJ is equal to 0
for all I not equal to J then

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1065-1
00:05:02.268 --> 00:05:04.356
this is orthogonal.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1102-0
00:05:07.956 --> 00:05:14.470
But if yeah, I dot AJE equal to
0 for all I not equal to

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1102-1
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:20.985
J&amp;AI dot AI equal to 1 for
all I then this is called

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1102-2
00:05:20.985 --> 00:05:22.356
orthonormal.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1115-0
00:05:26.336 --> 00:05:29.946
OK, for example, one 1 -, 1,
one.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1118-0
00:05:30.026 --> 00:05:31.166
This is orthogonal, right?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1128-0
00:05:39.846 --> 00:05:41.846
You multiply this year A1.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1133-0
00:05:41.856 --> 00:05:42.836
This is a one.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1139-0
00:05:42.906 --> 00:05:43.756
This is a two.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1161-0
00:05:44.186 --> 00:05:47.538
So what is the dot product of A1
and A21 into minus 1 + 1 into

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1161-1
00:05:47.538 --> 00:05:48.336
one which is 0?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1187-0
00:05:48.626 --> 00:05:52.348
So this is orthogonal, but this
is not orthonormal because the

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1187-1
00:05:52.348 --> 00:05:54.416
length of this is actually sqrt
2.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1234-0
00:05:54.826 --> 00:05:58.901
The 7th of this is also sqrt 2,
but you can convert it to

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1234-1
00:05:58.901 --> 00:06:03.398
orthonormal by dividing by sqrt
2 so one by sqrt 2, one by sqrt

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1234-2
00:06:03.398 --> 00:06:05.646
2 -, 1 by sqrt 2, one by sqrt 2.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1261-0
00:06:06.996 --> 00:06:10.685
Now you check if you take the
dot product of these two, then

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1261-1
00:06:10.685 --> 00:06:12.016
you'll get it to be 0.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1286-0
00:06:13.336 --> 00:06:15.820
If you see the length of this
length of this will be one and

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1286-1
00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.326
the length of this also will be
one.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1288-0
00:06:17.716 --> 00:06:18.966
So this is orthonormal.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1290-0
00:06:22.646 --> 00:06:22.906
Agree.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1301-0
00:06:27.236 --> 00:06:28.626
Ohh, thank you Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1311-0
00:06:28.236 --> 00:06:29.826
Can you go a little bit upset?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1306-0
00:06:28.636 --> 00:06:29.406
One doubt.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1308-0
00:06:29.896 --> 00:06:30.566
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1312-0
00:06:30.626 --> 00:06:31.386
Yeah, so.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1314-0
00:06:31.326 --> 00:06:31.666
Good.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1320-0
00:06:33.516 --> 00:06:34.086
And kisser?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1323-0
00:06:34.096 --> 00:06:34.906
I'm audible, yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1341-0
00:06:40.396 --> 00:06:42.176
So veggies are one doubt here.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1337-0
00:06:42.706 --> 00:06:42.916
Hmm.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1396-0
00:06:43.856 --> 00:06:50.999
ANIKET here in orthogonal what
we have done is a 1 * 2 right A1

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1396-1
00:06:50.999 --> 00:06:58.143
dot A2H which we are doing so A1
is nothing but a this both the

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1371-0
00:06:51.016 --> 00:06:52.136
Yeah, yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1396-2
00:06:58.143 --> 00:07:05.286
two columns which are multiplied
so one and minus how it is A1.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1414-0
00:07:05.956 --> 00:07:08.646
How we have done to 0 but they
said this one even.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1426-0
00:07:08.316 --> 00:07:11.106
Hey, this is dot product Papa
dot product.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1480-0
00:07:10.536 --> 00:07:10.916
Umm.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1431-0
00:07:11.496 --> 00:07:13.776
I think I have done this quite a
number of times.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1477-0
00:07:16.876 --> 00:07:21.287
If A1 is 1 vector and a two is 1
vector, the dot part of A1 and

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1477-1
00:07:21.287 --> 00:07:25.560
A2 is nothing but A1 transpose
A2A1 transpose will be one one

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1477-2
00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.766
and a two will be minus one one.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1484-0
00:07:28.256 --> 00:07:29.006
What do you get?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1493-0
00:07:28.646 --> 00:07:30.516
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's zero.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1496-0
00:07:29.076 --> 00:07:29.616
You get a 0.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1500-0
00:07:30.566 --> 00:07:31.426
Yes, yes, yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1502-0
00:07:31.766 --> 00:07:33.086
OK, right.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1512-0
00:07:34.756 --> 00:07:36.526
So let me start with lecture 4.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1521-0
00:07:36.976 --> 00:07:39.166
Should I give an overview of
this?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1533-0
00:07:39.216 --> 00:07:40.890
I hope you would have gone
through the lecture slides

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1533-1
00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:41.076
right.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1551-0
00:07:50.286 --> 00:07:52.186
And no, Sir, actually didn't get
time.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1565-0
00:07:52.186 --> 00:07:56.039
No, no, we didn't get time
because her today only it was

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1564-0
00:07:55.316 --> 00:07:55.596
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1565-1
00:07:56.039 --> 00:07:56.986
uploaded here.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1579-0
00:08:03.616 --> 00:08:07.946
Now you see this if you're now
I'm.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1593-0
00:08:07.956 --> 00:08:11.396
I am to consider only square
matrices AN crossing.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1634-0
00:08:13.296 --> 00:08:16.474
OK, so in the in the next one or
two LECTURES, we'll be

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1634-1
00:08:16.474 --> 00:08:19.935
considering only AN cross and
and if if there is a different

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1634-2
00:08:19.935 --> 00:08:23.226
matrix, I will explicitly
mention the size of the matrix.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1642-0
00:08:23.736 --> 00:08:25.226
Now you are given a in cross
north.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1665-0
00:08:26.006 --> 00:08:29.618
I told you that if I multiply
this by X geometrically what

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1665-1
00:08:29.618 --> 00:08:32.006
happens is that there is an
extension.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1668-0
00:08:34.196 --> 00:08:35.096
Slash compression.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1679-0
00:08:37.176 --> 00:08:38.716
And there is a change in angle.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1680-0
00:08:39.626 --> 00:08:39.896
Correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1695-0
00:08:42.046 --> 00:08:44.966
Or this is also called rotation
agree.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1701-0
00:08:44.576 --> 00:08:46.776
OK, agreed.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1707-0
00:08:45.886 --> 00:08:49.956
So if I you there is a point
here, a vector.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1741-0
00:08:49.966 --> 00:08:53.828
Here I have a matrix A I'm
drawing in two dimensions, but

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1741-1
00:08:53.828 --> 00:08:57.824
this is applicable for any
dimensions I know multiply a, so

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1741-2
00:08:57.824 --> 00:08:59.156
this is my X vector.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1759-0
00:08:59.166 --> 00:09:03.092
So if you multiply by a X
probably I will get a new vector

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1759-1
00:09:03.092 --> 00:09:04.356
which is like this.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1773-0
00:09:04.756 --> 00:09:07.896
This is I want to call AX you
see this is elongated.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1780-0
00:09:09.946 --> 00:09:10.786
And this is rotated.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1794-0
00:09:11.916 --> 00:09:14.126
Now, don't ask me whether this
is the.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1803-0
00:09:14.136 --> 00:09:16.066
It is always moving to the left
or not.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1815-0
00:09:16.236 --> 00:09:18.666
There is a teta by which it is
good.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1832-0
00:09:18.676 --> 00:09:21.623
I am not quantifying the Theta
and there is elongation

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1832-1
00:09:21.623 --> 00:09:22.856
sometimes what happens.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1839-0
00:09:22.866 --> 00:09:24.346
You can also have a compression.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1853-0
00:09:24.356 --> 00:09:28.911
You can also get something like
this, so this can also be your

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1853-1
00:09:28.911 --> 00:09:29.056
X.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1865-0
00:09:29.066 --> 00:09:31.976
Maybe I'll write it as a a tilde
X.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1878-0
00:09:32.346 --> 00:09:35.273
Now this is the angle Theta and
this is you see this is

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1878-1
00:09:35.273 --> 00:09:36.266
compressed correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1886-0
00:09:40.686 --> 00:09:40.866
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1889-0
00:09:41.096 --> 00:09:41.576
Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1893-0
00:09:41.406 --> 00:09:41.946
Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1909-0
00:09:41.916 --> 00:09:48.166
OK so now I am interested in
some vectors and some scalars.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1896-0
00:09:43.376 --> 00:09:43.866
God.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1928-0
00:09:48.656 --> 00:09:50.946
Now, what are the scalars and
what are those vectors?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1957-0
00:09:51.416 --> 00:09:55.221
Now I I'm looking for all
nonzero vectors X and scalars

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1957-1
00:09:55.221 --> 00:09:59.433
which are called Lambda such
that the effect of AX is nothing

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1957-2
00:09:59.433 --> 00:10:00.316
but Lambda X.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1986-0
00:10:02.286 --> 00:10:05.946
Which means you say the effect
of multiplying this eggs with

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1986-1
00:10:05.946 --> 00:10:09.486
the A is same as multiplying
this X with the scalar agree.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1997-0
00:10:12.266 --> 00:10:12.476
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2002-0
00:10:12.626 --> 00:10:14.386
So, so, so, so please come
again.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/1998-0
00:10:13.586 --> 00:10:13.726
But.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2005-0
00:10:15.846 --> 00:10:16.276
What happened?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2008-0
00:10:17.196 --> 00:10:17.426
Got.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2011-0
00:10:17.856 --> 00:10:18.806
Please come again, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2013-0
00:10:18.816 --> 00:10:19.026
I'll.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2019-0
00:10:19.036 --> 00:10:19.566
I'll lost it.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2030-0
00:10:19.576 --> 00:10:20.126
Please come again.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2048-0
00:10:20.446 --> 00:10:24.493
They they effect of multiplying
X with a on the left is same as

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2048-1
00:10:24.493 --> 00:10:26.706
multiplying the X with the
scalar.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2050-0
00:10:29.906 --> 00:10:30.046
That.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2068-0
00:10:32.146 --> 00:10:37.059
So if you remember vector
algebra, if this is except this

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2068-1
00:10:37.059 --> 00:10:38.076
is 2X agree.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2078-0
00:10:41.486 --> 00:10:41.776
Right.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2079-0
00:10:41.716 --> 00:10:42.006
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2090-0
00:10:42.666 --> 00:10:45.136
This is the exact and so on.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2087-0
00:10:44.826 --> 00:10:45.086
Right.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2108-0
00:10:46.946 --> 00:10:52.099
So I am looking for those X for
which this X is the same

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2108-1
00:10:52.099 --> 00:10:53.726
direction as X OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2113-0
00:10:58.076 --> 00:10:58.596
Do you get it?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2119-0
00:11:00.606 --> 00:11:00.786
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2133-0
00:11:01.656 --> 00:11:08.346
OK, so if I write it in in the
in the normal.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2124-0
00:11:02.106 --> 00:11:02.516
Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2187-0
00:11:10.036 --> 00:11:16.591
Yeah, equation form if my AC is
going to be A1A11A12 up to

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2187-1
00:11:16.591 --> 00:11:23.813
A1NA21A22 up to a 2N and all the
reply A and 1A into all the way

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2187-2
00:11:23.813 --> 00:11:25.146
up to Anand.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2214-0
00:11:25.996 --> 00:11:30.710
Now I'm going to write this
equation a X equal to Lambda X

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2214-1
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:34.146
and in in the in the in the
equation form.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2232-0
00:11:34.156 --> 00:11:37.146
So my ex is going to be X1X2 all
the way up to X.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2234-0
00:11:37.156 --> 00:11:37.486
Agree.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2246-0
00:11:38.366 --> 00:11:42.216
So what is a X equal to Lambda X
means?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2256-0
00:11:42.226 --> 00:11:44.006
So this means I'll write the
first equation.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2282-0
00:11:45.246 --> 00:11:51.014
What is the first equation A11X1
plus A12X2 plus all the way up

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2282-1
00:11:51.014 --> 00:11:52.366
to A1 and exit?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2294-0
00:11:52.716 --> 00:11:54.966
This will be equal to Lambda
times 61. Agree.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2295-0
00:11:55.696 --> 00:11:56.006
Correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2301-0
00:12:02.526 --> 00:12:03.196
Yes, Sir. Fine.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2343-0
00:12:04.016 --> 00:12:09.556
And if you, if you agree, I can
also write a I1X1 plus AI2X2

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2306-0
00:12:04.176 --> 00:12:04.306
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2343-1
00:12:09.556 --> 00:12:14.914
plus all the way up to AINXN
will be equal to Lambda times

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2343-2
00:12:14.914 --> 00:12:15.186
XI.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2347-0
00:12:15.616 --> 00:12:16.036
You agree?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2355-0
00:12:17.586 --> 00:12:17.806
Right.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2356-0
00:12:17.946 --> 00:12:18.086
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2362-0
00:12:18.446 --> 00:12:18.926
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2367-0
00:12:19.006 --> 00:12:21.026
For all I, this is a
generalization.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2378-0
00:12:21.896 --> 00:12:25.796
Now you see in the IT equation,
there will be one.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2389-0
00:12:26.156 --> 00:12:32.366
And one element called AIIXI
agree.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2395-0
00:12:34.736 --> 00:12:34.976
Umm.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2396-0
00:12:35.426 --> 00:12:35.596
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2437-0
00:12:35.706 --> 00:12:43.579
In between, OK, so I will write
a I1X1 plus AI2X2 plus all the

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2437-1
00:12:43.579 --> 00:12:51.577
way up to plus AII minus Lambda
X8 plus all the way up to AINXN

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2437-2
00:12:51.577 --> 00:12:53.826
equal to 0, right?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2449-0
00:12:59.716 --> 00:13:00.896
OK, got it. Umm.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2445-0
00:13:01.006 --> 00:13:01.526
Got it.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2467-0
00:13:01.706 --> 00:13:06.846
OK, now if I see this is for all
I you.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2465-0
00:13:06.096 --> 00:13:07.146
Sir didn't get it.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2482-0
00:13:07.156 --> 00:13:10.216
Like why AIL minus Lambda Excel?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2492-0
00:13:10.586 --> 00:13:12.836
I am I am bringing this term to
the left hand side.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2488-0
00:13:13.656 --> 00:13:13.986
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2496-0
00:13:13.996 --> 00:13:14.756
OK, OK. Got it.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2506-0
00:13:14.766 --> 00:13:15.946
Yeah, right.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2511-0
00:13:15.346 --> 00:13:17.466
So so that my right hand side
becomes 0, right?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2509-0
00:13:18.166 --> 00:13:18.416
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2519-0
00:13:18.426 --> 00:13:20.846
OK, OK, I missed that zero
actually.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2521-0
00:13:21.546 --> 00:13:21.876
Hmm.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2539-0
00:13:22.706 --> 00:13:27.762
So if I need now write it in
matrix one, this will be

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2539-1
00:13:27.762 --> 00:13:29.916
something like a minus.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2563-0
00:13:32.946 --> 00:13:39.202
A minus Lambda I times X1X2 all
the day of two except equal to

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2563-1
00:13:39.202 --> 00:13:40.096
0, right?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2589-0
00:13:45.266 --> 00:13:49.282
In the first equation you will
get AI minus Lambda, so it's a

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2576-0
00:13:45.556 --> 00:13:46.016
Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2589-1
00:13:49.282 --> 00:13:49.736
Lambda.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2604-0
00:13:49.746 --> 00:13:55.706
I part this I can simply write
as a minus Lambda.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2609-0
00:13:55.716 --> 00:13:57.666
I * X is equal to 0, correct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2620-0
00:14:01.746 --> 00:14:02.206
Is.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2624-0
00:14:02.726 --> 00:14:04.966
OK, Yikes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2626-0
00:14:02.836 --> 00:14:03.036
Uh.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2630-0
00:14:02.966 --> 00:14:04.136
Where X is a vector, right?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2644-0
00:14:04.976 --> 00:14:06.666
Is it after the same vector I've
written it here?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2639-0
00:14:05.976 --> 00:14:06.426
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2652-0
00:14:06.736 --> 00:14:07.856
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2670-0
00:14:07.926 --> 00:14:11.643
So, Sir, how did we get a minus
Lambda into X equals to zero on

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2670-1
00:14:11.643 --> 00:14:12.456
the left side?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2696-0
00:14:13.516 --> 00:14:17.124
Are you write down the equations
one by one in the in the first

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2689-0
00:14:16.426 --> 00:14:16.646
Uh-huh.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2696-1
00:14:17.124 --> 00:14:19.436
equation you will get a 11 minus
Lambda.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2704-0
00:14:21.666 --> 00:14:22.126
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2716-0
00:14:22.866 --> 00:14:26.096
In the second equation you will
get a UH-22 minus Lambda.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2732-0
00:14:26.106 --> 00:14:28.736
In the third equation you get a
33 minus Lambda and so on.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2745-0
00:14:28.746 --> 00:14:31.046
The last equation you get A and
then minus Lambda, correct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2754-0
00:14:31.876 --> 00:14:32.556
Right, right.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2757-0
00:14:32.596 --> 00:14:33.986
You put all of them in a matrix
form.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2758-0
00:14:35.076 --> 00:14:35.326
Uh-huh.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2766-0
00:14:37.736 --> 00:14:39.456
OK, got it.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2770-0
00:14:38.026 --> 00:14:38.446
Got it.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2775-0
00:14:39.376 --> 00:14:40.706
Ohh rank you Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2777-0
00:14:39.466 --> 00:14:40.166
Got it. Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2786-0
00:14:40.756 --> 00:14:43.986
Just one confusion for the first
equation.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2804-0
00:14:44.356 --> 00:14:49.126
We can say like AIX one is this
correct my understanding?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2810-0
00:14:49.716 --> 00:14:51.696
Sir, can you please take a two
by two matrix?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2811-0
00:14:52.766 --> 00:14:52.996
Umm.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2833-0
00:14:58.956 --> 00:15:05.026
A11A12A13A14 ohh sorry, I will.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2836-0
00:15:03.706 --> 00:15:03.946
Mm-hmm.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2841-0
00:15:05.036 --> 00:15:06.256
I will call you as benefit.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2859-0
00:15:06.266 --> 00:15:09.936
I will write in the general form
A1A2 OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2857-0
00:15:08.286 --> 00:15:08.466
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2864-0
00:15:10.166 --> 00:15:10.966
OK. OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2880-0
00:15:12.076 --> 00:15:16.546
Times X1X2 will be equal to
Lambda times X1X2, correct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2881-0
00:15:17.586 --> 00:15:17.866
Correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2885-0
00:15:22.566 --> 00:15:24.006
Bye. Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2889-0
00:15:26.166 --> 00:15:26.596
Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2894-0
00:15:26.606 --> 00:15:27.206
Please proceed.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2932-0
00:15:28.396 --> 00:15:34.822
So A11X1 plus A12X2 will be
equal to Lambda X1 and yet to

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2932-1
00:15:34.822 --> 00:15:39.586
1X1 plus A22X2 will be equal to
Lambda X2.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2943-0
00:15:40.566 --> 00:15:42.786
Now you bring Lambda X or to the
left hand side.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2988-0
00:15:42.796 --> 00:15:48.327
This will give you a 11 minus
Lambda times X1 plus A12X2 will

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2988-1
00:15:48.327 --> 00:15:54.214
be equal to 0 and A21X1 plus A22
minus Lambda X2 will be equal to

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2988-2
00:15:54.214 --> 00:15:55.106
0 correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2992-0
00:15:57.856 --> 00:15:58.036
Right.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2994-0
00:15:58.366 --> 00:15:58.496
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/2995-0
00:15:59.546 --> 00:15:59.706
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3034-0
00:16:00.166 --> 00:16:07.866
Now, now if you do these two, if
you do these two, I can write it

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3010-0
00:16:02.596 --> 00:16:03.186
You have seen.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3034-1
00:16:07.866 --> 00:16:13.116
as a 11 minus Lambda A12A21A22
minus Lambda.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3047-0
00:16:13.456 --> 00:16:16.296
Now X1X2 will be equal to 00,
correct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3048-0
00:16:17.846 --> 00:16:18.126
Right.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3064-0
00:16:19.296 --> 00:16:23.896
Now this is basically nothing
but my A minus Lambda times I.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3059-0
00:16:19.496 --> 00:16:19.636
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3074-0
00:16:28.896 --> 00:16:29.476
Yes, yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3076-0
00:16:30.256 --> 00:16:30.416
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3078-0
00:16:30.366 --> 00:16:31.406
That's what I have written here.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3081-0
00:16:31.396 --> 00:16:31.636
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3086-0
00:16:32.576 --> 00:16:32.746
True.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3084-0
00:16:32.856 --> 00:16:33.766
OK, got it.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3089-0
00:16:33.776 --> 00:16:34.226
So yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3100-0
00:16:35.816 --> 00:16:37.066
Umm got.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3105-0
00:16:36.396 --> 00:16:39.816
So now you have a minus Lambda
dense X is 0.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3117-0
00:16:40.176 --> 00:16:45.846
Suppose suppose a minus Lambda I
is nonsingular.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3132-0
00:16:48.746 --> 00:16:49.776
What does this imply?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3148-0
00:16:50.066 --> 00:16:53.936
Determinant of a minus Lambda I
is not equal to 0.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3144-0
00:16:50.556 --> 00:16:51.846
That not equal to 0.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3205-0
00:16:54.326 --> 00:16:58.538
Then I can multiply this
equation, I will call it as one

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3205-1
00:16:58.538 --> 00:17:03.120
multiply equation, one with a
minus Lambda I whole inverse to

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3205-2
00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:07.997
get a minus Lambda old inverse a
minus Lambda I * X will be equal

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3205-3
00:17:07.997 --> 00:17:11.766
to a minus Lambda hi whole
inverse into 0 correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3234-0
00:17:12.866 --> 00:17:16.109
Now this is basically identity
times X which is equal to 0

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3234-1
00:17:16.109 --> 00:17:19.077
which will imply X equal to 0
but X equal to 0 is not

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3234-2
00:17:19.077 --> 00:17:20.726
interesting to anybody, right?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3241-0
00:17:24.906 --> 00:17:25.286
Correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3257-0
00:17:25.276 --> 00:17:27.516
And my assumption was X is not
equal to 0.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3259-0
00:17:25.296 --> 00:17:28.476
We need X not equals to 0,
correct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3278-0
00:17:29.656 --> 00:17:35.460
So if I want to get X not equal
to 0, my determinant of a minus

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3278-1
00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:36.276
Lambda I.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3285-0
00:17:38.256 --> 00:17:39.816
Should be equal to 0, correct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3295-0
00:17:44.076 --> 00:17:44.266
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3302-0
00:17:45.306 --> 00:17:47.676
They didn't have a minus Lambda
equal to 0.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3314-0
00:17:47.826 --> 00:17:50.419
Basically yields the value of
Lambda which are called the

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3314-1
00:17:50.419 --> 00:17:50.956
eigenvalues.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3322-0
00:17:57.316 --> 00:17:58.666
Sir, how did we link?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3343-0
00:17:58.586 --> 00:18:00.586
But anymore, can you repeat my
statement?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3338-0
00:17:58.796 --> 00:18:00.326
X not equal to 0.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3351-0
00:18:00.336 --> 00:18:01.806
To that that equals to 0.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3345-0
00:18:00.736 --> 00:18:01.616
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3364-0
00:18:03.376 --> 00:18:04.226
I started just.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3411-0
00:18:03.506 --> 00:18:07.833
I am saying you if you have
minus if a minus Lambda is

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3372-0
00:18:03.696 --> 00:18:04.906
So can you please?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3388-0
00:18:04.276 --> 00:18:06.546
Could you repeat this one from?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3393-0
00:18:06.066 --> 00:18:07.746
Yeah, this one, please repeat
VENKATA Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3390-0
00:18:06.486 --> 00:18:06.896
I repeat.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3411-1
00:18:07.833 --> 00:18:12.789
nonsingular, then determinative
a minus Lambda is not equal to

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3409-0
00:18:10.706 --> 00:18:11.336
Umm.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3411-2
00:18:12.789 --> 00:18:12.946
0.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3423-0
00:18:14.586 --> 00:18:14.946
Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3424-0
00:18:14.786 --> 00:18:15.086
Correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3428-0
00:18:15.816 --> 00:18:17.366
That means a minus Lambda is
invertible.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3434-0
00:18:18.466 --> 00:18:18.746
Correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3437-0
00:18:19.586 --> 00:18:19.716
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3457-0
00:18:19.606 --> 00:18:23.869
So if you multiply a a A minus
Lambda into X equal to 0, this

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3457-1
00:18:23.869 --> 00:18:27.376
equation with the A minus Lambda
whole in inverse.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3490-0
00:18:27.386 --> 00:18:30.271
What do I get a minus Lambda
whole inverse into a minus

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3482-0
00:18:29.066 --> 00:18:29.936
Equal to 0.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3490-1
00:18:30.271 --> 00:18:32.796
Lambda X equal to four X = 0 is
not interesting.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3517-0
00:18:33.226 --> 00:18:36.857
What you are saying is you take
any matrix, you take the 0

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3500-0
00:18:33.496 --> 00:18:33.736
Right.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3517-1
00:18:36.857 --> 00:18:39.626
vector, you multiply this with
the 0 vector.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3536-0
00:18:39.636 --> 00:18:43.005
You're going to get 0 vector, so
I don't think there is anything

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3536-1
00:18:43.005 --> 00:18:44.146
big about this, right?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3535-0
00:18:44.936 --> 00:18:45.186
Right.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3548-0
00:18:46.356 --> 00:18:48.536
So we're looking for non 0 exit
now.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3555-0
00:18:48.546 --> 00:18:49.786
How will you get nonzero X?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3583-0
00:18:49.796 --> 00:18:52.682
You will get a nonzero X only
when determinant of a minus

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3583-1
00:18:52.682 --> 00:18:53.926
Lambda is equal to 0. OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3587-0
00:18:55.366 --> 00:18:56.446
A singular matrix. OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3597-0
00:18:56.786 --> 00:19:01.696
Hmm, but A minus Lambda is equal
to 0.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3607-0
00:19:02.086 --> 00:19:06.516
This will yield single and I can
learn this.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3618-0
00:19:09.706 --> 00:19:11.296
Eigenvalues for a.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3615-0
00:19:11.806 --> 00:19:12.136
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3624-0
00:19:12.166 --> 00:19:13.106
Igen value Sophie?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3627-0
00:19:15.856 --> 00:19:16.176
Agreed.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3632-0
00:19:17.396 --> 00:19:17.706
Right.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3641-0
00:19:18.786 --> 00:19:21.056
8 minus Lambda is eigenvalue of
a.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3638-0
00:19:19.326 --> 00:19:19.606
It.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3659-0
00:19:22.546 --> 00:19:25.324
Determinant of a minus Lambda
equal to 0 yields the

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3659-1
00:19:25.324 --> 00:19:26.286
eigenvalues are K.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3667-0
00:19:27.276 --> 00:19:27.936
OK, OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3677-0
00:19:28.536 --> 00:19:32.745
OK, if you want to take, you can
take an example A equal to

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3677-1
00:19:32.745 --> 00:19:33.166
upper.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3687-0
00:19:33.176 --> 00:19:35.516
Now you know some good example
two by two case.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3696-0
00:19:41.246 --> 00:19:42.296
Said one ticket, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3700-0
00:19:41.296 --> 00:19:41.546
So.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3701-0
00:19:42.306 --> 00:19:42.846
I'll just give you.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3707-0
00:19:48.276 --> 00:19:48.966
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3712-0
00:19:49.056 --> 00:19:50.606
Let me take 1234.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3718-0
00:19:50.956 --> 00:19:51.806
What is the problem?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3724-0
00:19:52.016 --> 00:19:52.916
Is it OK with everybody?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3734-0
00:19:54.496 --> 00:19:54.996
Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3728-0
00:19:54.916 --> 00:19:55.046
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3739-0
00:19:56.066 --> 00:19:57.706
So what is a minus Lambda?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3744-0
00:19:57.716 --> 00:19:58.536
A matrix.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3757-0
00:19:58.546 --> 00:20:02.576
This is nothing but one minus
Lambda 234 minus Lambda.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3768-0
00:20:02.906 --> 00:20:05.276
What is determinant of a minus
Lambda I?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3781-0
00:20:06.066 --> 00:20:10.876
This is equal to 1 minus Lambda
into 4 minus Lambda minus six.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3812-0
00:20:12.116 --> 00:20:16.863
This is equal to Lambda square
minus five Lambda plus 4 -, 6

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3812-1
00:20:16.863 --> 00:20:21.455
which is nothing but Lambda
square minus five Lambda minus

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3812-2
00:20:21.455 --> 00:20:21.766
two.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3820-0
00:20:22.266 --> 00:20:23.876
Now I equate this to 0.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3831-0
00:20:24.026 --> 00:20:26.316
So what do I get Lambda equal
to?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3849-0
00:20:26.386 --> 00:20:31.818
5 plus or minus root of 5 square
B square minus four AC plus

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3849-1
00:20:31.818 --> 00:20:32.976
eight by two.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3865-0
00:20:34.476 --> 00:20:38.226
This is giving you 5 plus minus
root of 33 by two.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3867-0
00:20:38.816 --> 00:20:39.136
Agree.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3875-0
00:20:40.176 --> 00:20:40.416
Right.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3917-0
00:20:40.926 --> 00:20:45.183
So there are two eigenvalues 1
eigenvalue Lambda equal to five

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3917-1
00:20:45.183 --> 00:20:49.306
plus root 33 by two and another
value is 5 minus root 233 by

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3922-0
00:20:45.446 --> 00:20:49.136
But 33 blade, 25 minus root 332.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3917-2
00:20:49.306 --> 00:20:49.576
two.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3925-0
00:20:49.986 --> 00:20:51.406
So these are the two
eigenvalues.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3927-0
00:20:53.676 --> 00:20:53.976
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3938-0
00:20:56.136 --> 00:20:57.566
You can take it as a result.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3937-0
00:20:56.516 --> 00:20:56.646
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3950-0
00:20:58.436 --> 00:21:05.416
And N by N matrix it has N
eigenvalues.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3964-0
00:21:08.546 --> 00:21:11.336
Since it is 2 by 2, you get 2
eigenvalues.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3987-0
00:21:11.636 --> 00:21:15.024
There is a simple octave thing
to get these eigenvalues, so I

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/3987-1
00:21:15.024 --> 00:21:16.936
can demonstrate it to you for
you.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4000-0
00:21:16.946 --> 00:21:19.336
If you want to, you just type A.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4007-0
00:21:18.496 --> 00:21:20.296
Said that, that is universal,
right?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4012-0
00:21:21.286 --> 00:21:22.006
What is universal?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4051-0
00:21:22.676 --> 00:21:28.192
Like we have two, I mean and I
can values for A&amp;BN matrix

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4042-0
00:21:27.726 --> 00:21:29.336
Yeah, that's what I wrote as a
result.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4051-1
00:21:28.192 --> 00:21:30.416
whatever value is and OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4044-0
00:21:29.846 --> 00:21:29.996
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4070-0
00:21:31.146 --> 00:21:37.906
So yeah, is 1234 you just type
EG of a 18 bracket A?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4074-0
00:21:38.406 --> 00:21:39.266
What do you get this?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4080-0
00:21:39.276 --> 00:21:42.216
Basically, the two eigenvectors
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4083-0
00:21:48.886 --> 00:21:49.186
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4086-0
00:21:51.156 --> 00:21:51.576
Is.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4111-0
00:21:52.446 --> 00:21:56.799
OK, so you can get these
eigenvalues and once you get

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4111-1
00:21:56.799 --> 00:22:01.716
these eigenvalues you can get
something called eigenvectors.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4117-0
00:22:02.206 --> 00:22:03.996
Now, how do you obtain
eigenvectors?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4123-0
00:22:04.206 --> 00:22:04.916
You will take.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4150-0
00:22:06.316 --> 00:22:12.345
You will take the equation so
you take first consider Lambda

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4150-1
00:22:12.345 --> 00:22:18.176
one and you say A minus Lambda
1X A minus Lambda one type.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4159-0
00:22:20.656 --> 00:22:22.696
I * X will be equal to 0.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4178-0
00:22:24.326 --> 00:22:29.475
Now try to solve for this and
you will get an exit that X is

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4178-1
00:22:29.475 --> 00:22:30.066
called.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4183-0
00:22:31.896 --> 00:22:32.776
Yeah, you can vector.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4191-0
00:22:35.666 --> 00:22:39.186
Corresponding to Lambda one
agree.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4219-0
00:22:41.406 --> 00:22:47.384
If you saw a minus Lambda one I
times X equal to zero, you will

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4219-1
00:22:47.384 --> 00:22:49.346
get a solution for X.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4239-0
00:22:49.876 --> 00:22:52.902
Now that X is called, the
eigenvector corresponding Lambda

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4239-1
00:22:52.902 --> 00:22:55.056
only, you cannot say general
eigenvalues.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4260-0
00:22:55.986 --> 00:23:01.196
So what I have done is I have a
matrix a, a matrix A which is

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4260-1
00:23:01.196 --> 00:23:02.456
north crossing.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4276-0
00:23:02.966 --> 00:23:06.736
This will have Lambda 1, Lambda
2 all the way to Lambda.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4281-0
00:23:06.746 --> 00:23:08.356
North Las N eigenvalues.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4293-0
00:23:08.806 --> 00:23:12.156
What will be the eigenvector
corresponding to Lambda 1X1?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4322-0
00:23:12.486 --> 00:23:15.591
What will be the eigenvalue
corresponding Lambda 2 this be

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4322-1
00:23:15.591 --> 00:23:17.906
X2 and this will be all the way
up to exit.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4329-0
00:23:18.656 --> 00:23:20.286
Now this is the correspondence.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4361-0
00:23:20.296 --> 00:23:23.518
So if you have this as an
eigenvalue eigenvector pair, you

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4361-1
00:23:23.518 --> 00:23:26.576
will be able to write a X1 will
be equal to Lambda 1X1.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4375-0
00:23:27.376 --> 00:23:29.926
If you take this pair, you will
be able to write a.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4382-0
00:23:29.936 --> 00:23:32.406
XN will be equal to Lambda NXN.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4388-0
00:23:32.856 --> 00:23:35.746
Now this is the correspondence
agree.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4392-0
00:23:42.296 --> 00:23:42.416
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4394-0
00:23:43.436 --> 00:23:44.286
OK, fine.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4415-0
00:23:44.436 --> 00:23:47.096
Should I do an example of
finding the eigenvectors?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4413-0
00:23:47.846 --> 00:23:48.416
Uh, no.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4433-0
00:23:48.426 --> 00:23:52.236
So can you please repeat the
last statement? Uh.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4424-0
00:23:49.486 --> 00:23:50.176
Yes, please. Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4453-0
00:23:52.326 --> 00:23:56.153
I'm saying you cannot call any
vector and I can vector

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4453-1
00:23:56.153 --> 00:23:59.146
correspond to any other
eigenvalue Lambda.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4456-0
00:24:00.376 --> 00:24:00.586
Umm.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4482-0
00:24:00.926 --> 00:24:04.631
There is a unique association,
so you first find Lambda 1

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4482-1
00:24:04.631 --> 00:24:08.016
Lambda to up to Lambda N and
then find X1X2 updates.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4497-0
00:24:08.026 --> 00:24:12.176
In this XN is the eigenvector
corresponding to Lambda one.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4504-0
00:24:12.326 --> 00:24:13.876
So that's how these two are
related.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4507-0
00:24:13.986 --> 00:24:14.396
Agree.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4510-0
00:24:15.156 --> 00:24:15.496
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4527-0
00:24:16.066 --> 00:24:20.096
Don't link anything from X1 to
X2X2.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4554-0
00:24:20.106 --> 00:24:24.041
Is eigenvector corresponding to
Lambda 2 and you will write the

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4554-1
00:24:24.041 --> 00:24:27.977
equation for this as a X2 will
be equal to Lambda X2 Lambda 2X2

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4554-2
00:24:27.977 --> 00:24:28.346
agree.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4558-0
00:24:29.236 --> 00:24:29.616
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4565-0
00:24:30.576 --> 00:24:32.966
You cannot confuse these two
now.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4582-0
00:24:33.026 --> 00:24:35.853
If you want an example to find
eigenvectors upper, you are

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4582-1
00:24:35.853 --> 00:24:37.866
looking for example you got that
example.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4596-0
00:24:45.076 --> 00:24:46.536
I think Aparna is not there.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4599-0
00:24:47.416 --> 00:24:49.276
Uh set uh aboard.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4611-0
00:24:49.356 --> 00:24:52.306
I have one doubt in that the
matrix above.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4610-0
00:24:50.886 --> 00:24:51.066
No.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4619-0
00:24:54.416 --> 00:24:55.266
You added some.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4627-0
00:24:55.276 --> 00:24:56.886
Glad that Lambda values right?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4666-0
00:24:56.896 --> 00:25:03.869
So you added only four minus
Lambda, but why we adding only

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4666-1
00:25:03.869 --> 00:25:07.936
on the first one and the last
one?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4662-0
00:25:05.626 --> 00:25:07.006
And VIKAS sojas.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4671-0
00:25:09.106 --> 00:25:09.506
And work.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4669-0
00:25:09.676 --> 00:25:09.986
I.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4686-0
00:25:10.716 --> 00:25:13.026
Uh, the tumor?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4690-0
00:25:12.326 --> 00:25:12.876
I didn't get you.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4720-0
00:25:12.896 --> 00:25:17.905
On the the you you mentioned
that one minus Lambda 4 minus

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4705-0
00:25:13.036 --> 00:25:15.776
Classical Raja at the Nuka like.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4720-1
00:25:17.905 --> 00:25:22.066
Lambda but 2/3 is you are not
added any lambdas.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4711-0
00:25:18.126 --> 00:25:18.286
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4743-0
00:25:24.046 --> 00:25:32.166
No, A minus Lambda I Bubba A1234
minus Lambda times 1001.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4753-0
00:25:33.026 --> 00:25:37.666
This is 1234 minus Lambda 00
Lambda.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4771-0
00:25:40.406 --> 00:25:45.026
This is 1 minus Lambda 234 minus
agree.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4769-0
00:25:45.886 --> 00:25:46.376
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4773-0
00:25:46.466 --> 00:25:46.876
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4777-0
00:25:46.926 --> 00:25:47.246
Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4792-0
00:25:48.186 --> 00:25:50.396
OK, fine. I'm.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4820-0
00:25:49.626 --> 00:25:52.888
So so sorry, but what you're
trying to achieve here with this

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4811-0

Yeah, but it was. Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4820-1
00:25:52.888 --> 00:25:55.466
problem you're trying to get a
eigenvector here.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4813-0
00:25:54.016 --> 00:25:54.456
He lost.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4831-0
00:25:55.556 --> 00:25:57.696
Yeah, KOLAY here, but.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4825-0
00:25:57.286 --> 00:25:58.256
No, I got.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4862-0
00:25:58.266 --> 00:26:01.076
I can values I'm trying to get
the eigenvector now.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4848-0
00:25:59.636 --> 00:26:00.456
It's OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4854-0
00:26:00.466 --> 00:26:01.356
It is hot Tony.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4870-0
00:26:01.366 --> 00:26:02.036
Kangana. Spoon.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4879-0
00:26:02.286 --> 00:26:04.006
No, Saurabh, can you go on mute
syrup.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4873-0
00:26:04.096 --> 00:26:04.346
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4875-0
00:26:04.356 --> 00:26:04.526
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4880-0
00:26:04.536 --> 00:26:05.356
Sorry, sorry, sorry. Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4884-0
00:26:07.286 --> 00:26:08.026
Sorry, that correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4920-0
00:26:09.486 --> 00:26:14.144
So I am trying to find a vectors
X such that the effect of

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4920-1
00:26:14.144 --> 00:26:19.197
multiplying a with this ** will
be same as multiplying the same

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4920-2
00:26:19.197 --> 00:26:21.566
same X with the scalar Lambda.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4937-0
00:26:24.606 --> 00:26:28.016
I'm trying to find those paths
London next.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4941-0
00:26:27.576 --> 00:26:29.916
Or but just a question.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4962-0
00:26:29.926 --> 00:26:34.656
So this a vector will not cause
any change in it.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4966-0
00:26:32.316 --> 00:26:33.636
Yeah, you said that you said
matrix.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4979-0
00:26:34.666 --> 00:26:38.433
Yes, this a will not cause any
change in rotation or angle

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4979-1
00:26:38.433 --> 00:26:38.816
right?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4999-0
00:26:38.926 --> 00:26:41.476
It will just cause the
extension, yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/4988-0
00:26:39.206 --> 00:26:39.466
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5007-0
00:26:39.626 --> 00:26:45.156
I I will tell you that so if I
take some other matrix.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5021-0
00:26:46.496 --> 00:26:50.906
Five, I don't know whether I
have worked out something here.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5024-0
00:26:51.536 --> 00:26:52.236
Let me check.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5036-0
00:27:05.576 --> 00:27:06.386
Just give the gift.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5064-0
00:27:06.696 --> 00:27:09.336
Should I give an example and
then I can vector Sir?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5052-0
00:27:08.106 --> 00:27:08.666
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5057-0
00:27:09.266 --> 00:27:09.676
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5071-0
00:27:09.686 --> 00:27:12.276
You can you you give a good
matrix for that is sufficient.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5086-0
00:27:13.286 --> 00:27:16.506
Yeah, minus four to be 2 is
enough.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5092-0
00:27:15.866 --> 00:27:18.436
Minus minus F.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5096-0
00:27:16.516 --> 00:27:19.806
Loser minus minus 2.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5099-0
00:27:20.876 --> 00:27:21.056
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5106-0
00:27:22.406 --> 00:27:23.886
Then 2 -, 1.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5123-0
00:27:24.876 --> 00:27:28.878
OK, so if I take this matrix a
now, I will quickly calculate

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5123-1
00:27:28.878 --> 00:27:30.846
the eigen values eigen values.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5142-0
00:27:30.856 --> 00:27:36.697
The solutions of a Lambda plus
one into Lambda plus 4 -, 4

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5142-1
00:27:36.697 --> 00:27:37.786
equal to 0.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5172-0
00:27:37.796 --> 00:27:42.930
This is Lambda squared plus five
Lambda equal to 0, so Lambda

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5159-0
00:27:40.766 --> 00:27:41.146
You.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5172-1
00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:47.484
equal to 0 or Lambda equal to
Lambda equal to minus 5.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5172-2
00:27:47.484 --> 00:27:48.146
Correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5178-0
00:27:51.306 --> 00:27:52.166
These are the eigenvalues.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5195-0
00:27:55.936 --> 00:27:56.436
But it.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5197-0
00:27:56.456 --> 00:27:57.186
Agree. Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5226-0
00:27:56.916 --> 00:28:00.538
Like the guys are just one
doubt, this Lambda plus one

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5199-0
00:27:57.146 --> 00:27:57.626
Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5226-1
00:28:00.538 --> 00:28:03.106
Lambda plus 4 -, 4 how this is
formed?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5222-0
00:28:03.226 --> 00:28:04.026
Hey, baby, this is.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5230-0
00:28:04.036 --> 00:28:05.586
I'm doing it for the fifth time.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5233-0
00:28:05.836 --> 00:28:06.086
You.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5241-0
00:28:06.096 --> 00:28:07.596
You I I think you should write
it down.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5260-0
00:28:07.606 --> 00:28:10.594
You cannot simply see me writing
down everything I have passed

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5260-1
00:28:10.594 --> 00:28:12.206
this course with good marks
here.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5265-0
00:28:12.696 --> 00:28:14.206
A lot of times you take.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5278-0
00:28:14.216 --> 00:28:16.686
I just know I explained here how
I got this.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5287-0
00:28:16.696 --> 00:28:17.786
You do this chip there.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5308-0
00:28:18.136 --> 00:28:21.756
If you do this step, you are
going to subtract from this a

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5307-0
00:28:18.456 --> 00:28:20.796
OK 1/2.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5308-1
00:28:21.756 --> 00:28:22.186
Lambda.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5341-0
00:28:22.276 --> 00:28:26.054
You're going to subtract from
this a Lambda and you are going

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5341-1
00:28:26.054 --> 00:28:29.527
to get it, so I'm going to
subtract from minus 4A Lambda

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5344-0
00:28:29.486 --> 00:28:29.736
Umm.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5341-2
00:28:29.527 --> 00:28:30.746
and minus 1A Lambda.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5364-0
00:28:30.996 --> 00:28:34.686
So you will get a -, 4 minus
Lambda two 2 -, 1 minus Lambda.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5363-0
00:28:33.676 --> 00:28:33.856
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5387-0
00:28:35.126 --> 00:28:36.866
You want to play, you get the
determinant of that.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5375-0
00:28:35.896 --> 00:28:36.176
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5378-0
00:28:36.186 --> 00:28:36.386
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5382-0
00:28:36.396 --> 00:28:37.446
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5390-0
00:28:37.616 --> 00:28:38.306
Yes, got it.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5406-0
00:28:37.896 --> 00:28:40.106
Do it for along with me.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5395-0
00:28:38.316 --> 00:28:38.956
Got it through this.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5401-0
00:28:38.966 --> 00:28:39.466
Yes, yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5418-0
00:28:39.796 --> 00:28:42.716
Yeah, actually this was this was
this was I missed out.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5415-0
00:28:40.156 --> 00:28:40.716
OK, take.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5422-0
00:28:42.776 --> 00:28:43.446
That's the reason.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5431-0
00:28:43.456 --> 00:28:44.496
Sorry, yes, I got it.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5434-0
00:28:44.276 --> 00:28:45.226
OK, fine.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5439-0
00:28:44.636 --> 00:28:45.476
Yeah, yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5452-0
00:28:45.616 --> 00:28:50.366
So now I want so I got the I can
values as zero and minus five.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5465-0
00:28:50.916 --> 00:28:53.506
Now the question is, how do I
get the eigenvector?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5487-0
00:28:53.516 --> 00:28:56.422
So let's say for example, do you
want me to do for Lambda equal

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5487-1
00:28:56.422 --> 00:28:58.056
to 0 or Lambda equal to minus
five?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5497-0
00:28:58.066 --> 00:28:59.186
Do one you will do one of them.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5502-0
00:28:59.776 --> 00:29:00.336
Minus V.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5528-0
00:29:01.206 --> 00:29:04.955
OK, so you want to take Lambda
equal to minus five, so you have

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5528-1
00:29:04.955 --> 00:29:07.826
to solve the system AX equal to
minus π X agree.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5545-0
00:29:10.596 --> 00:29:10.976
Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5571-0
00:29:11.076 --> 00:29:17.346
You got you guys say Lambda is
minus 5, so now you write this

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5555-0
00:29:11.746 --> 00:29:13.606
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5571-1
00:29:17.346 --> 00:29:20.076
minus 4 -, 4, two, 2, -, 1.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5590-0
00:29:20.926 --> 00:29:28.586
Now this times X1X2 will be
equal to minus 5X1X2, correct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5586-0
00:29:25.756 --> 00:29:26.156
Excellent.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5592-0

Miss it.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5612-0
00:29:36.346 --> 00:29:37.466
X equal to minus 5.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5611-0
00:29:36.416 --> 00:29:37.136
Yes, Sir.

00:29:49.376 --> 00:29:50.146
Yes, Sir, it's clear.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5664-0
00:29:49.406 --> 00:29:49.836
Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5668-0
00:29:49.406 --> 00:29:49.936
It is it.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5671-0
00:29:50.346 --> 00:29:50.976
It doesn't mean.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5675-0
00:29:50.566 --> 00:29:51.146
I can.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5688-0
00:29:51.046 --> 00:29:51.516
Foundation.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5677-0
00:29:51.436 --> 00:29:51.856
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5690-0
00:29:51.866 --> 00:29:53.806
So you can write it in the
scalar form.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5712-0
00:29:53.866 --> 00:29:58.230
You can also write it in the
vector form saying that this is

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5712-1
00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:00.806
a + 5 I times X equal to 0
correct.

4 Two 2 -, 1 +, 5 means you'll
add a + 5.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5772-0
00:30:11.966 --> 00:30:13.376
Here you'll add a + 5 here,
correct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5778-0
00:30:14.446 --> 00:30:14.646
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5779-0
00:30:14.806 --> 00:30:15.046
Yep.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5785-0
00:30:15.656 --> 00:30:16.236
But it's it.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5791-0
00:30:16.836 --> 00:30:20.026
Times X1X2 equal to 00.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5804-0
00:30:20.116 --> 00:30:22.586
This is by the way, vector 0,
not a scale as zero.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5832-0
00:30:24.046 --> 00:30:31.846
OK, so now if you do that you
will get 1224X1X2 equal to 00

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5830-0
00:30:30.936 --> 00:30:31.286
Next.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5832-1
00:30:31.846 --> 00:30:32.886
correct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5835-0
00:30:33.516 --> 00:30:33.686
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5887-0
00:30:35.186 --> 00:30:38.841
Now the question is, while this
looks like 2 equations, it is

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5887-1
00:30:38.841 --> 00:30:42.260
basically one equation only
because if you take the first

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5887-2
00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:45.620
equation it will give you X1
plus 2X2 equal to 0 and the

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5887-3
00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:48.626
second equation give you 2 X 1 +
4 X 2 equal to 0.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5898-0
00:30:48.936 --> 00:30:51.686
This is basically nothing but
two times the first equation.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5905-0
00:30:55.766 --> 00:30:55.876
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5906-0
00:30:55.826 --> 00:30:56.016
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5919-0
00:30:57.226 --> 00:30:58.636
So what is the rank of this
matrix?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5930-0
00:30:57.616 --> 00:31:02.396
As said, I said of one thing,
how we.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5928-0
00:31:00.656 --> 00:31:00.816
But.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5929-0
00:31:01.836 --> 00:31:02.216
1.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5945-0
00:31:04.866 --> 00:31:08.516
I said how we reach to that 1A
plus 5I.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5955-0
00:31:09.516 --> 00:31:09.826
X.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5965-0
00:31:10.456 --> 00:31:17.231
EXE equal to Lambda X which
means a minus Lambda I * X equal

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5965-1
00:31:17.231 --> 00:31:17.786
to 0.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6000-0
00:31:18.696 --> 00:31:24.824
Now your Lambda is minus 5, so
this is a + 5 I times X equal to

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5991-0
00:31:24.206 --> 00:31:24.776
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6000-1
00:31:24.824 --> 00:31:25.016
0.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5993-0
00:31:25.206 --> 00:31:25.576
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/5996-0
00:31:25.586 --> 00:31:26.106
OK. OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6002-0
00:31:26.116 --> 00:31:26.556
Thank you.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6010-0
00:31:26.666 --> 00:31:26.936
Thank you.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6019-0
00:31:26.686 --> 00:31:29.856
Now you see the rank of this
matrix 1224.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6045-0
00:31:30.026 --> 00:31:33.888
It is going to be only one now
since the rank is 1, the

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6045-1
00:31:33.888 --> 00:31:37.956
information is conveyed by one
of these row elements only.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6072-0
00:31:38.206 --> 00:31:42.699
So if I take X1 plus 2X2 equal
to zero, I will get X1 will be

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6072-1
00:31:42.699 --> 00:31:44.076
equal to minus 2X2.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6086-0
00:31:44.586 --> 00:31:49.876
So I put any arbitrary value,
let's say alpha for X2.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6094-0
00:31:49.926 --> 00:31:51.856
My extra will be minus 2A,
correct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6097-0
00:31:53.566 --> 00:31:53.966
Music.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6116-0
00:31:55.336 --> 00:31:59.337
So you if you take the alpha
out, this will be nothing but

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6116-1
00:31:59.337 --> 00:32:00.286
minus two one.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6128-0
00:32:01.256 --> 00:32:08.146
So I can say that I can vector
eigenvector is generated.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6135-0
00:32:09.716 --> 00:32:12.276
By minus 21, agree.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6160-0
00:32:16.096 --> 00:32:17.986
Please for my.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6154-0
00:32:16.576 --> 00:32:17.146
He said.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6155-0
00:32:17.106 --> 00:32:17.506
Instead.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6164-0
00:32:17.596 --> 00:32:18.486
Yes, yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6169-0
00:32:19.506 --> 00:32:20.756
He generated by minus one.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6173-0
00:32:20.766 --> 00:32:21.716
You take the matrix.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6190-0
00:32:21.726 --> 00:32:27.856
Now, what is the matrix minus
four 2 -, 4, two, 2 -, 1?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6203-0
00:32:28.346 --> 00:32:31.636
Now I'm going to multiply it
with this vector minus 21.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6227-0
00:32:32.166 --> 00:32:36.333
What am I going to get minus
four to minus two is 8 + 2 is 10

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6227-1
00:32:36.333 --> 00:32:37.946
and this is nothing but.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6241-0
00:32:40.436 --> 00:32:42.986
2 * -, 2 is minus 4 -, 5
correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6251-0
00:32:47.746 --> 00:32:47.866
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6264-0
00:32:48.556 --> 00:32:51.814
Which is nothing, but if you
take minus five here, this will

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6264-1
00:32:51.814 --> 00:32:52.936
be minus 21, correct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6274-0
00:32:56.326 --> 00:32:56.466
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6275-0
00:32:56.646 --> 00:32:56.986
Agreed.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6298-0
00:32:57.036 --> 00:33:00.755
So the so the effect of
multiplying this vector with

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6277-0
00:32:57.246 --> 00:32:57.366
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6302-0
00:32:58.686 --> 00:32:58.846
But.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6298-1
00:33:00.755 --> 00:33:05.176
this A is same as multiplying
the same vector with the scalar.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6300-0
00:33:10.326 --> 00:33:10.686
Agreed.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6306-0
00:33:13.366 --> 00:33:13.496
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6307-0
00:33:13.506 --> 00:33:13.646
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6312-0
00:33:14.626 --> 00:33:14.756
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6316-0
00:33:15.736 --> 00:33:16.506
OK, fine.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6320-0
00:33:15.786 --> 00:33:16.096
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6336-0
00:33:16.596 --> 00:33:21.236
You can now do the same thing
for for but.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6337-0
00:33:20.516 --> 00:33:23.156
Can you please scroll up once
just little bit?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6344-0
00:33:24.896 --> 00:33:27.256
I I've I'm a little down.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6348-0
00:33:29.296 --> 00:33:29.556
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6365-0
00:33:29.566 --> 00:33:31.386
Bus was so so here.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6373-0
00:33:31.396 --> 00:33:35.075
I have only one question like
when when you have multiplied

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6373-1
00:33:35.075 --> 00:33:36.546
the edit edit plus five.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6377-0
00:33:36.596 --> 00:33:37.126
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6380-0
00:33:37.416 --> 00:33:38.516
In the second line.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6389-0
00:33:38.736 --> 00:33:40.686
So why this two and two?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6397-0
00:33:40.696 --> 00:33:44.176
These two are not added plus
five like the.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6413-0
00:33:47.936 --> 00:33:50.226
Minus 4 + 5 then again.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6433-0
00:33:49.636 --> 00:33:53.898
I just now told you saying when
you do this kind of thing, only

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6433-1
00:33:53.898 --> 00:33:55.696
the diagonals get affected.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6441-0
00:33:56.546 --> 00:33:58.296
Other elements are with zeros
only.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6440-0
00:33:57.266 --> 00:33:57.886
OK, OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6444-0
00:34:00.406 --> 00:34:00.766
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6456-0
00:34:01.996 --> 00:34:05.626
OK, so now the question.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6454-0
00:34:03.396 --> 00:34:03.816
Yeah. OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6466-0
00:34:04.386 --> 00:34:04.926
Hello.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6474-0
00:34:05.716 --> 00:34:06.476
Yeah, go ahead.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6481-0
00:34:06.486 --> 00:34:09.346
So one thing that's up to find
the eigenvalue.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6495-0
00:34:09.356 --> 00:34:13.486
The matrix should be always in
the singular form, am I right?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6502-0
00:34:15.726 --> 00:34:16.376
Which metric?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6520-0
00:34:17.646 --> 00:34:20.296
But the game yet it's been a
single.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6527-0
00:34:19.456 --> 00:34:23.186
No, A is really matrix A minus
Lambda only should be singular.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6530-0
00:34:24.516 --> 00:34:25.106
Ohh.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6544-0
00:34:29.816 --> 00:34:31.196
It can be any matrix, yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6569-0
00:34:32.216 --> 00:34:36.102
Here it is a Singh the sample
the example what is given here

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6569-1
00:34:36.102 --> 00:34:37.886
is a singular 1 right there.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6566-0
00:34:37.026 --> 00:34:39.156
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it is.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6573-0
00:34:39.166 --> 00:34:39.956
It is, yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6602-0
00:34:39.966 --> 00:34:42.923
This in this case it becomes a
singular matrix, so I'm gonna

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6602-1
00:34:42.923 --> 00:34:46.026
tell you some properties of that
we are going to see that here.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6610-0
00:34:47.256 --> 00:34:47.706
Uh.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6632-0
00:34:47.506 --> 00:34:51.058
Said if we add the eigenvalues,
we're getting the trace of the

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6632-1
00:34:51.058 --> 00:34:52.186
matrix like minus 4.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6630-0
00:34:51.646 --> 00:34:52.576
Ah, that is what that is.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6645-0
00:34:52.586 --> 00:34:55.211
One of the properties, so I'm
just going to write the

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6644-0
00:34:54.056 --> 00:34:54.456
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6645-1
00:34:55.211 --> 00:34:55.746
properties.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6656-0
00:34:58.406 --> 00:35:03.986
The properties are, so one is
some of eigen values.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6672-0
00:35:06.246 --> 00:35:11.846
Is equal to sum of diagonal
elements of a matrix.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6679-0
00:35:15.216 --> 00:35:17.266
What is minus 4 -, 1.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6695-0
00:35:21.666 --> 00:35:22.386
Minus 5.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6702-0
00:35:22.296 --> 00:35:22.606
The.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6711-0
00:35:22.436 --> 00:35:23.016
Minus 3.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6690-0
00:35:22.576 --> 00:35:23.206
And my.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6708-0
00:35:23.336 --> 00:35:24.206
Mind is fine.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6714-0
00:35:23.366 --> 00:35:23.996
My name is poop.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6713-0
00:35:23.436 --> 00:35:24.016
Minus one.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6726-0
00:35:24.476 --> 00:35:27.756
What is 0 +, -, 5?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6731-0
00:35:28.676 --> 00:35:29.366
China space.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6735-0
00:35:28.816 --> 00:35:29.476
Minus 5.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6732-0
00:35:29.986 --> 00:35:30.656
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6739-0
00:35:30.726 --> 00:35:31.696
So that is what it is.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6762-0
00:35:31.706 --> 00:35:36.968
So minus 4 -, 1 equal to minus 5
+ 0, both of which is minus 5,

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6762-1
00:35:36.968 --> 00:35:37.626
correct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6772-0
00:35:39.446 --> 00:35:44.976
Taking product of are you
getting values?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6779-0
00:35:46.826 --> 00:35:47.786
Will be the determinant.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6825-0
00:35:54.086 --> 00:35:57.630
Here what is the product of
eigenvalues minus five into zero

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6825-1
00:35:57.630 --> 00:36:01.057
and if you take determinant
value it'll be minus four into

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6808-0
00:35:59.296 --> 00:35:59.736
But the.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6814-0
00:36:00.766 --> 00:36:01.056
0.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6825-2
00:36:01.057 --> 00:36:03.846
minus four 4 -, 4 which is equal
to 0, correct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6827-0
00:36:05.006 --> 00:36:05.206
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6829-0
00:36:05.556 --> 00:36:05.716
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6839-0
00:36:06.716 --> 00:36:12.026
So if and Lambda equal to 0 is
an eigenvalue.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6848-0
00:36:14.796 --> 00:36:16.156
What will be the product of
eigenvalues?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6853-0
00:36:18.756 --> 00:36:19.056
0.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6865-0
00:36:19.876 --> 00:36:23.946
Ah, determinant will be equal to
0, therefore the matrix.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6872-0
00:36:26.096 --> 00:36:26.756
Is singular.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6875-0
00:36:28.946 --> 00:36:29.206
Agree.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6883-0
00:36:31.036 --> 00:36:31.416
He is.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6886-0
00:36:31.576 --> 00:36:31.976
He is.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6924-0
00:36:32.966 --> 00:36:36.087
So you already just find out
whether Lambda is equal to 0 is

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6924-1
00:36:36.087 --> 00:36:38.696
an eigenvalue or not, and if
that is an eigenvalue

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6924-2
00:36:38.696 --> 00:36:41.766
determinant value will be 0 and
the matrix is singular. OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6934-0
00:36:45.136 --> 00:36:45.736
OK, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6935-0
00:36:45.516 --> 00:36:45.876
Pardon.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6937-0
00:36:47.296 --> 00:36:47.826
Yes. No.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6959-0
00:36:48.816 --> 00:36:52.116
OK, I can give you one more
thing which is not done in the

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6959-1
00:36:52.116 --> 00:36:53.346
book but video object.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6966-0
00:36:54.866 --> 00:36:55.466
No, it's OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6972-0
00:36:56.206 --> 00:36:57.116
No, Sir, we want.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/6978-0
00:36:57.236 --> 00:36:59.986
OK, so there is one simple
trick.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7018-0
00:37:00.026 --> 00:37:05.696
So many, many people find out
you are given a very big matrix,

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7018-1
00:37:05.696 --> 00:37:11.276
so you are given a big matrix A
and you are asked to find out

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7018-2
00:37:11.276 --> 00:37:15.596
whether can 11 be an icon value
of this matrix.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7025-0
00:37:16.486 --> 00:37:17.076
Sorry Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7029-0
00:37:16.606 --> 00:37:18.166
So now yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7030-0
00:37:18.326 --> 00:37:19.356
Sorry to interrupt Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7034-0
00:37:19.366 --> 00:37:20.336
This lakshman here.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7046-0
00:37:20.526 --> 00:37:23.036
So could you please repeat that
first one pointer?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7085-0
00:37:23.426 --> 00:37:27.759
Some of you couldn't values
equal to some of that I can some

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7067-0
00:37:25.496 --> 00:37:26.486
Folks are not equal.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7077-0
00:37:26.496 --> 00:37:28.596
The sum of eigenvalues thing.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7085-1
00:37:27.759 --> 00:37:28.896
of eigen values.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7097-0
00:37:29.526 --> 00:37:31.406
Yeah, you if you Add all the.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7090-0
00:37:30.476 --> 00:37:31.166
I just know.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7093-0
00:37:31.176 --> 00:37:31.586
I just.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7101-0
00:37:32.156 --> 00:37:33.556
I just can't get.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7126-0
00:37:33.596 --> 00:37:37.826
I just missed out on the sum of
the diagonal and some of it.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7147-0
00:37:37.836 --> 00:37:41.417
I can't get that equation, so
just could you small, but that's

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7147-1
00:37:41.417 --> 00:37:41.986
OK for me.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7166-0
00:37:42.696 --> 00:37:46.330
Some of you Add all the
eigenvalues that will be equal

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7160-0
00:37:45.576 --> 00:37:45.836
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7166-1
00:37:46.330 --> 00:37:49.436
to the sum of diagonal elements
of the matrix.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7169-0
00:37:51.676 --> 00:37:52.026
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7176-0
00:37:52.076 --> 00:37:52.456
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7199-0
00:37:52.466 --> 00:37:59.038
Which means uh diagonal matrix
means a of a of one 1 + a of

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7187-0
00:37:54.146 --> 00:37:55.236
So if I have a meet.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7199-1
00:37:59.038 --> 00:37:59.476
2/2.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7208-0
00:37:59.606 --> 00:38:01.856
Those the diagonal matrix fine,
thank you.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7205-0
00:37:59.896 --> 00:38:00.496
Yeah, got it.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7210-0
00:38:01.546 --> 00:38:01.916
Correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7250-0
00:38:02.406 --> 00:38:07.549
OK, now, now there is something
called Crestor in theorem now

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7224-0
00:38:03.036 --> 00:38:04.436
But it's a continue.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7250-1
00:38:07.549 --> 00:38:12.361
that states whether whether a
number can be an eigenvalue

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7250-2
00:38:12.361 --> 00:38:15.016
probable eigenvalue of a matrix.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7258-0
00:38:16.616 --> 00:38:18.006
Now you are given a big matrix.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7281-0
00:38:18.016 --> 00:38:21.736
AL, let's say 10 cross 10 matrix
and you're asked to find out

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7281-1
00:38:21.736 --> 00:38:23.656
whether 11 can be an eigenvalue.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7286-0
00:38:23.666 --> 00:38:24.496
This can be very tricky.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7314-0
00:38:25.836 --> 00:38:28.853
Why this tricky is you have to
find out all the 10 eigen values

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7314-1
00:38:28.853 --> 00:38:31.116
right to check whether level is
an eigen value.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7317-0
00:38:32.746 --> 00:38:33.056
Correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7341-0
00:38:34.196 --> 00:38:39.357
But uh, the Grushkin says that
OK before I go to Gregorian, do

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7341-1
00:38:39.357 --> 00:38:41.896
you know the meaning of mod of?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7344-0
00:38:44.106 --> 00:38:44.506
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7357-0
00:38:46.606 --> 00:38:52.476
Minus R uh a -, B is less than
R.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7363-0
00:38:55.266 --> 00:38:55.676
No, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7365-0
00:38:56.636 --> 00:38:57.226
No, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7370-0
00:38:57.296 --> 00:38:58.036
No Vengi, Sir, no.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7378-0
00:38:59.296 --> 00:39:02.216
OK, now a -.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7382-0
00:39:02.226 --> 00:39:04.436
B is less than R.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7389-0
00:39:04.916 --> 00:39:06.166
And in place.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7396-0
00:39:06.176 --> 00:39:08.576
So let's say this A is there.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7412-0
00:39:10.726 --> 00:39:15.036
And there are a there is
something called the radius.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7417-0
00:39:15.646 --> 00:39:17.856
Now, this actually represents a
sphere.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7427-0
00:39:20.126 --> 00:39:25.926
Spear with uh, radius R and
center B.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7441-0
00:39:28.456 --> 00:39:30.326
So what is the ABR?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7445-0
00:39:28.876 --> 00:39:29.816
In one dimension.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7459-0
00:39:31.136 --> 00:39:33.996
But when the baby are, when I
move there.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7461-0
00:39:34.856 --> 00:39:35.016
What?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7468-0
00:39:35.576 --> 00:39:37.616
But what is the AB and R?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7475-0
00:39:39.266 --> 00:39:42.296
These are three quantities I'm
saying.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7485-0
00:39:43.146 --> 00:39:45.376
What is the meaning in one
dimension?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7492-0
00:39:45.856 --> 00:39:49.406
I am going to keep some element
be here.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7507-0
00:39:51.696 --> 00:39:54.726
And I'm going to ask for all
elements.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7525-0
00:39:55.296 --> 00:39:58.900
If I subtract from a this
element, I should get something

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7525-1
00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:01.386
which is less than R in absolute
value.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7534-0
00:40:01.576 --> 00:40:04.056
So you will see that this number
can be.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7542-0
00:40:04.846 --> 00:40:07.586
And what what can be this
number?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7547-0
00:40:10.186 --> 00:40:10.656
But what?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7560-0
00:40:10.666 --> 00:40:12.306
What is the meaning of partner
or?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7567-0
00:40:13.636 --> 00:40:14.596
Really not like we did.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7573-0
00:40:14.606 --> 00:40:15.956
B -, R and B + R.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7589-0
00:40:19.546 --> 00:40:21.206
For what is our, what is the
meaning of?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7590-0
00:40:20.506 --> 00:40:21.066
Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7592-0
00:40:22.526 --> 00:40:22.806
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7602-0
00:40:22.816 --> 00:40:24.406
All we said, abstract quantity.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7600-0
00:40:22.976 --> 00:40:23.626
That is a scalar.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7604-0
00:40:24.466 --> 00:40:24.696
Me.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7618-0
00:40:25.656 --> 00:40:25.916
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7613-0
00:40:27.146 --> 00:40:28.196
R is an abstract point.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7639-0
00:40:28.206 --> 00:40:32.289
I am trying to find out the
solution to a where a -, B in

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7639-1
00:40:32.289 --> 00:40:35.316
absolute value is less than or
equal to R.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7659-0
00:40:37.126 --> 00:40:42.304
So this quantity A can lie
between B -, R two, B + R

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7659-1
00:40:42.304 --> 00:40:43.086
correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7662-0
00:40:43.706 --> 00:40:43.826
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7670-0
00:40:44.716 --> 00:40:45.336
Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7672-0
00:40:45.956 --> 00:40:46.356
Yes, yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7690-0
00:40:46.006 --> 00:40:51.586
OK, so it is it is something
like I am asking you the price

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7676-0
00:40:46.236 --> 00:40:46.916
Yes, you know.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7690-1
00:40:51.586 --> 00:40:52.516
of a site.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7710-0
00:40:54.386 --> 00:41:01.806
And if I say the price I have in
mind, Venky has in mind minus.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7728-0
00:41:02.586 --> 00:41:06.746
But example, Lakshman, whatever
he has told this, is actually

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7728-1
00:41:06.746 --> 00:41:07.686
less than ₹50.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7740-0
00:41:08.726 --> 00:41:11.796
Now what can we in VENKATA mind
there?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7742-0
00:41:12.096 --> 00:41:12.736
Whatever.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7753-0
00:41:12.746 --> 00:41:17.016
Lakshman minus 50 to Laxman plus
50. Correct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7760-0
00:41:17.946 --> 00:41:19.286
Can you only this range correct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7759-0
00:41:18.436 --> 00:41:18.536
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7765-0
00:41:23.046 --> 00:41:23.276
His.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7773-0
00:41:24.416 --> 00:41:24.596
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7776-0
00:41:25.696 --> 00:41:26.756
That is what I have written.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7812-0
00:41:26.766 --> 00:41:30.760
This is B -, R two, B + R so
this A lies actually between B

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7812-1
00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:34.287
-, R to B + R Now this is
actually the equation of a

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7812-2
00:41:34.287 --> 00:41:37.216
circle in two dimensions in two
dimensions.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7819-0
00:41:37.226 --> 00:41:38.216
What can it be?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7827-0
00:41:38.226 --> 00:41:42.516
Can be something like this so
too big.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7844-0
00:41:48.876 --> 00:41:52.146
In three dimensions, the three
dimensional sphere, and so on.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7852-0
00:41:52.336 --> 00:41:54.256
So that is the locus of all
these points.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7858-0
00:41:55.986 --> 00:41:57.656
Now what?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7861-0
00:41:57.666 --> 00:41:58.716
Mr Chris Goring.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7871-0
00:42:03.246 --> 00:42:05.926
This is that you take a matrix.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7886-0
00:42:07.656 --> 00:42:10.336
Should I take a two by two
matrix to explain you simply?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7889-0
00:42:11.026 --> 00:42:11.206
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7900-0
00:42:12.846 --> 00:42:12.966
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7907-0
00:42:13.066 --> 00:42:15.566
Kritika what is the matrix you
told previously?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7902-0
00:42:13.266 --> 00:42:13.646
Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7912-0
00:42:15.616 --> 00:42:17.126
Minus 4 two 2 -.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7914-0
00:42:17.136 --> 00:42:17.346
One.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7917-0
00:42:17.616 --> 00:42:18.576
Shall I take this example?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7935-0
00:42:20.656 --> 00:42:23.246
Minus 4 two 2 -, 1 so.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7929-0
00:42:20.696 --> 00:42:20.846
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7930-0
00:42:20.936 --> 00:42:21.146
Please.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7947-0
00:42:23.256 --> 00:42:26.596
If you take this a what we
should risk, organ says.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7971-0
00:42:29.036 --> 00:42:35.312
Is if you have a Lambda, the
Lambda should satisfy something

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7971-1
00:42:35.312 --> 00:42:35.826
like.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7983-0
00:42:37.326 --> 00:42:42.420
You take the diagonal element in
each case, so Lambda minus minus

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/7983-1
00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:42.806
four.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8007-0
00:42:43.726 --> 00:42:47.533
This should be less than equal
to sum of absolute values of all

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8007-1
00:42:47.533 --> 00:42:49.436
the other elements in that room.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8013-0
00:42:49.966 --> 00:42:51.666
In this case it is MOD 2,
correct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8020-0
00:42:56.596 --> 00:42:58.136
So the statement please once
again.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8041-0
00:42:59.966 --> 00:43:08.156
So Lambda minus AII is less than
equal to Sigma in the IT row.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8049-0
00:43:08.566 --> 00:43:09.296
What do you have?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8051-0
00:43:10.086 --> 00:43:10.926
The row number is.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8063-0
00:43:19.346 --> 00:43:21.136
This is what we should record,
it says.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8066-0
00:43:25.036 --> 00:43:25.276
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8074-0
00:43:27.386 --> 00:43:28.006
OK, see.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8088-0
00:43:29.466 --> 00:43:33.366
So if you come to the first row,
you take Lambda minus the first

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8088-1
00:43:33.366 --> 00:43:33.846
element.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8110-0
00:43:33.856 --> 00:43:38.319
Here will be less than or equal
to the sum of all the elements

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8110-1
00:43:38.319 --> 00:43:41.436
in absolute value, leaving this
minus four.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8118-0
00:43:41.626 --> 00:43:42.466
So which is 2?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8131-0
00:43:42.866 --> 00:43:45.176
If you do the same thing to 2nd
row, what will you get?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8147-0
00:43:45.706 --> 00:43:50.081
Lambda minus minus one will be
less than or equal to 2,

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8147-1
00:43:50.081 --> 00:43:50.706
correct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8148-0
00:43:50.386 --> 00:43:50.786
1.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8155-0
00:43:52.636 --> 00:43:53.036
Book.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8159-0
00:43:54.056 --> 00:43:55.216
I think you write opposite.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8163-0
00:43:54.526 --> 00:43:56.276
So, right.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8165-0
00:43:56.436 --> 00:43:57.926
I umm.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8179-0
00:43:57.956 --> 00:44:00.356
I I yeah, it's correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8175-0
00:43:59.656 --> 00:44:00.206
Who are you?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8183-0
00:44:00.216 --> 00:44:00.806
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8181-0
00:44:00.396 --> 00:44:01.246
AII.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8190-0
00:44:00.816 --> 00:44:02.056
OK. OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8192-0
00:44:01.296 --> 00:44:02.606
It's Jai, yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8214-0
00:44:02.446 --> 00:44:07.765
OK, so Lambda plus four less
than equal to two and Lambda

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8214-1
00:44:07.765 --> 00:44:11.066
plus one less than or equal to
two.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8245-0
00:44:11.656 --> 00:44:16.576
Now if I have to plot these
things in the graph paper in two

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8245-1
00:44:16.576 --> 00:44:21.819
dimension, I will tell you why 2
dimensional graph paper so fast

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8245-2
00:44:21.819 --> 00:44:23.916
is with radius minus four.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8254-0
00:44:24.996 --> 00:44:27.886
Uh center minus four and radius
two.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8271-0
00:44:28.136 --> 00:44:34.536
So there is something called
center minus 1 -, 2, -, 3 -, 4.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8283-0
00:44:36.036 --> 00:44:42.436
So I will draw the 1st circle,
find the spray minus six.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8290-0
00:44:42.826 --> 00:44:44.176
So you draw the 1st circle.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8296-0
00:44:44.186 --> 00:44:46.446
This is what are the limits.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8311-0
00:44:48.576 --> 00:44:50.196
Minus 6 to minus 2, right?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8313-0
00:44:48.636 --> 00:44:50.106
Minus Two 2 -, 6.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8315-0
00:44:51.896 --> 00:44:52.446
Yes Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8332-0
00:44:55.076 --> 00:44:56.576
Maybe I will try to like.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8334-0
00:44:56.256 --> 00:44:58.186
Circle between minus six and
minus 2.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8340-0
00:44:59.346 --> 00:45:01.526
Yeah, I said.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8346-0
00:45:01.526 --> 00:45:02.726
More managed to draw this.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8355-0
00:45:07.496 --> 00:45:08.926
OK, so this is 1 circle.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8367-0
00:45:08.936 --> 00:45:12.816
This is called the goal gives
disk, so this is 1 disk.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8370-0
00:45:12.826 --> 00:45:13.406
I have drug.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8375-0
00:45:13.756 --> 00:45:15.146
I have draw one more disk.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8379-0
00:45:15.156 --> 00:45:16.036
What is that disk?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8397-0
00:45:19.326 --> 00:45:23.866
That they're center minus one
and radius 2, right?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8398-0
00:45:24.576 --> 00:45:25.666
Minus three management.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8411-0
00:45:28.816 --> 00:45:30.286
Minus three 2 + 1.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8416-0
00:45:29.386 --> 00:45:33.736
So my ohh OK, so if I managed to
draw.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8461-0
00:45:39.466 --> 00:45:44.348
OK, So what we should just go
again says is that you draw

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8461-1
00:45:44.348 --> 00:45:49.567
these two disks for this two by
two matrix and if you have an

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8461-2
00:45:49.567 --> 00:45:53.776
eigenvalue it must reside inside
the disk. Agree.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8480-0
00:45:58.876 --> 00:46:01.176
You please listen to the card
statement very carefully.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8478-0
00:45:59.256 --> 00:45:59.466
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8500-0
00:46:01.186 --> 00:46:06.784
If you have and eigen value,
eigen value must be in this this

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8500-1
00:46:06.784 --> 00:46:07.506
only OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8509-0
00:46:09.896 --> 00:46:10.316
Focusing.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8525-0
00:46:11.306 --> 00:46:15.969
So you didn't something outside,
so I will ask one question can

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8525-1
00:46:15.969 --> 00:46:17.426
or be an eigenvalue?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8529-0
00:46:19.196 --> 00:46:19.416
No.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8531-0
00:46:20.116 --> 00:46:20.316
No.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8536-0
00:46:21.986 --> 00:46:22.376
No.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8544-0
00:46:22.426 --> 00:46:24.286
Why four is here correct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8549-0
00:46:25.536 --> 00:46:25.686
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8552-0
00:46:26.856 --> 00:46:28.256
And minus 6B.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8559-0
00:46:29.786 --> 00:46:30.726
And igen value.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8564-0
00:46:32.436 --> 00:46:32.816
No, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8570-0
00:46:33.196 --> 00:46:34.286
No. Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8567-0
00:46:33.396 --> 00:46:33.576
No.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8583-0
00:46:34.856 --> 00:46:38.336
So now can minus three be an
eigenvalue.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8580-0
00:46:35.416 --> 00:46:36.296
Yes. No.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8587-0
00:46:39.186 --> 00:46:39.326
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8636-0
00:46:40.276 --> 00:46:45.986
Yes, and these are why minus six
not because the limit is from

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8592-0
00:46:40.726 --> 00:46:41.076
Yes, yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8601-0
00:46:41.436 --> 00:46:41.806
Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8603-0
00:46:42.026 --> 00:46:42.176
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8636-1
00:46:45.986 --> 00:46:47.436
minus six to ah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8624-0
00:46:46.056 --> 00:46:46.796
No, no, no.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8627-0
00:46:46.376 --> 00:46:46.966
It should be in.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8629-0
00:46:46.936 --> 00:46:47.406
It is a.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8638-0
00:46:46.976 --> 00:46:47.956
The intersection I guess.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8648-0
00:46:47.416 --> 00:46:50.716
It is a less than so minus six
is not included here.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8645-0
00:46:49.746 --> 00:46:50.146
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8657-0
00:46:51.456 --> 00:46:52.956
Yeah, got it. OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8662-0
00:46:53.726 --> 00:46:56.676
Minus three, can it be an
eigenvalue maybe.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8689-0
00:46:59.146 --> 00:47:02.610
Now that every point here is an
eigenvalue, but if the

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8689-1
00:47:02.610 --> 00:47:05.256
eigenvalue is there, it will
reside here.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8704-0
00:47:05.546 --> 00:47:08.158
But it is not that every point
residing here is an icon that

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8704-1
00:47:08.158 --> 00:47:08.586
you agree.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8715-0
00:47:11.156 --> 00:47:11.376
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8717-0
00:47:11.466 --> 00:47:11.746
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8720-0
00:47:12.036 --> 00:47:13.306
Yeah, I have a doubt.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8724-0
00:47:12.976 --> 00:47:13.356
Goody.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8755-0
00:47:13.356 --> 00:47:16.639
The eigenvalues can be the
intersection of the circle, so

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8755-1
00:47:16.639 --> 00:47:19.016
it can be anywhere in any of the
circles.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8749-0
00:47:18.396 --> 00:47:19.186
You anywhere.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8760-0
00:47:19.236 --> 00:47:22.326
So I am saying you see you take
the boundary of this?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8766-0
00:47:24.496 --> 00:47:24.956
He is.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8777-0
00:47:26.886 --> 00:47:28.056
It can be anywhere here.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8789-0
00:47:28.106 --> 00:47:30.676
Inside this, you peel off the
outer layer.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8798-0
00:47:29.826 --> 00:47:33.936
So minus minus six is excluding
the outer layer.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8814-0
00:47:33.946 --> 00:47:34.876
We have to consider.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8804-0
00:47:34.916 --> 00:47:35.146
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8806-0
00:47:35.156 --> 00:47:35.346
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8810-0
00:47:35.356 --> 00:47:35.846
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8818-0
00:47:35.856 --> 00:47:36.886
You peel off the layer.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8830-0
00:47:37.356 --> 00:47:40.886
This layer I've drawn only for
you to understand.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8827-0
00:47:37.446 --> 00:47:37.806
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8837-0
00:47:41.986 --> 00:47:42.326
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8838-0
00:47:42.646 --> 00:47:43.906
Otherwise it is an open disk.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8851-0
00:47:45.816 --> 00:47:48.506
Satya, Aiden values are scalars,
right?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8860-0
00:47:48.626 --> 00:47:50.106
So it should be a line, right?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8862-0
00:47:48.856 --> 00:47:49.046
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8866-0
00:47:50.116 --> 00:47:51.946
Not a, but it's.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8882-0
00:47:51.956 --> 00:47:54.136
It's a one dimension, right, not
two dimensional, right?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8879-0
00:47:54.076 --> 00:47:55.286
Ah, good Christian.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8906-0
00:47:55.296 --> 00:48:00.485
So I am saying that you can have
a the solution of the quadratic

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8906-1
00:48:00.485 --> 00:48:04.956
equation whatever I got need not
be always real, right?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8917-0
00:48:08.386 --> 00:48:10.576
Ohh, you mean irrational
numbers.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8921-0
00:48:11.106 --> 00:48:12.916
The NO11.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8923-0
00:48:14.136 --> 00:48:14.436
Flex.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8943-0
00:48:15.906 --> 00:48:21.158
Yeah, if this is a matrix A,
what will be a minus Lambda IA

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8943-1
00:48:21.158 --> 00:48:22.296
minus Lambda.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8993-0
00:48:22.306 --> 00:48:28.110
I will be equal to minus Lambda
minus one one minus Lambda and

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8993-1
00:48:28.110 --> 00:48:34.098
so determinant of a minus Lambda
I determinant of a minus Lambda

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8993-2
00:48:34.098 --> 00:48:40.086
I will be equal to minus Lambda
into minus Lambda plus one which

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8984-0
00:48:36.436 --> 00:48:36.586
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/8993-3
00:48:40.086 --> 00:48:41.376
is equal to 0.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9017-0
00:48:41.386 --> 00:48:44.925
This is Lambda squared plus one
equal to zero, which implies

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9017-1
00:48:44.925 --> 00:48:46.956
Lambda squared equal to minus
one.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9027-0
00:48:47.276 --> 00:48:50.926
So therefore Lambda is plus
minus 8.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9032-0
00:48:51.436 --> 00:48:52.666
So this is a complex number.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9040-0
00:48:55.536 --> 00:48:56.316
Because on this.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9053-0
00:48:56.876 --> 00:49:01.322
Now complex numbers, how are
they represented in this in this

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9053-1
00:49:01.322 --> 00:49:02.326
plane? Please?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9061-0
00:49:02.336 --> 00:49:05.466
This is 0 + I and 0 -.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9074-0
00:49:05.476 --> 00:49:09.206
I where the zero is this 0 plus.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9076-0
00:49:09.216 --> 00:49:10.056
I will be here.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9083-0
00:49:12.816 --> 00:49:13.976
Minus I will be here.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9085-0
00:49:15.696 --> 00:49:15.976
Agree.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9089-0
00:49:19.336 --> 00:49:19.786
Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9098-0
00:49:19.796 --> 00:49:20.476
Yes, Sir. Understood.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9103-0
00:49:20.496 --> 00:49:22.826
OK, just to understand the
complex part of it.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9106-0
00:49:23.006 --> 00:49:23.846
OK, fine.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9114-0
00:49:24.116 --> 00:49:26.286
So now I have covered this.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9118-0
00:49:26.536 --> 00:49:27.986
Now there is something.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9143-0
00:49:28.296 --> 00:49:31.130
Can we just flip through the
slides so that I don't miss

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9138-0
00:49:30.606 --> 00:49:31.006
Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9143-1
00:49:31.130 --> 00:49:31.876
anything? Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9147-0
00:49:31.706 --> 00:49:33.286
Sir, I had a doubt Rushi here.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9150-0
00:49:33.886 --> 00:49:34.066
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9176-0
00:49:34.486 --> 00:49:38.354
Uh, so we're for example, if we
take a two dimensional metrics,

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9176-1
00:49:38.354 --> 00:49:41.496
we are saying they'll have two
eigen values, right.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9173-0
00:49:40.836 --> 00:49:41.016
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9188-0
00:49:41.926 --> 00:49:46.076
But this for solving it we are
getting a quadratic equation.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9203-0
00:49:46.086 --> 00:49:48.946
Quadratic equation can have one
solution also right?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9197-0
00:49:49.626 --> 00:49:49.936
Why?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9216-0
00:49:49.946 --> 00:49:51.896
How can it have one solution
which is repeated?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9214-0
00:49:50.516 --> 00:49:53.306
I mean, yeah, exactly.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9225-0
00:49:53.316 --> 00:49:55.006
Yeah, two solution but with
same.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9231-0
00:49:53.986 --> 00:49:54.166
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9251-0
00:49:55.536 --> 00:49:59.976
So then then still we are saying
they have to I can values.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9252-0
00:50:01.486 --> 00:50:02.846
Yeah, it has two again values.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9287-0
00:50:02.856 --> 00:50:07.180
There only thing is it it is
something like you are getting

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9287-1
00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:11.720
married and two people give you
₹1000 present you will say you

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9287-2
00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:13.306
got only 1000 or 2006.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9293-0
00:50:16.366 --> 00:50:17.286
Yeah. OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9307-0
00:50:18.056 --> 00:50:22.346
So Lambda 1 equal to two and
Lambda 2 is also equal to two.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9313-0
00:50:24.396 --> 00:50:24.676
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9319-0
00:50:25.636 --> 00:50:28.646
So there is no problem with
repeating eigenvalues.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9342-0
00:50:28.696 --> 00:50:32.655
I can give for example in a
matrix where you can have the

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9342-1
00:50:32.655 --> 00:50:34.566
same and igen values, right?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9358-0
00:50:34.576 --> 00:50:41.286
See for example I can have a a
matrix where this is a.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9364-0
00:50:41.356 --> 00:50:42.186
This is 0.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9368-0
00:50:42.196 --> 00:50:42.986
This is 0.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9372-0
00:50:42.996 --> 00:50:43.706
This is 2.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9392-0
00:50:43.716 --> 00:50:49.190
This is 2 now if you work out
the characteristic equation,

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9392-1
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:52.716
it'll be minus Lambda minus
Lambda 2.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9402-0
00:50:52.726 --> 00:50:55.226
Two, this will give you the
determinant of.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9416-0
00:50:55.236 --> 00:50:57.986
This will give you, so they
don't mean doubt.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9423-0
00:50:57.996 --> 00:51:00.856
This minus Lambda this minus
Lambda is this.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9436-0
00:51:01.106 --> 00:51:03.996
This is nothing but Lambda
square minus 4 equal to 0.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9439-0
00:51:04.406 --> 00:51:04.896
So what?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9445-0
00:51:04.906 --> 00:51:05.866
What are the eigenvalues?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9461-0
00:51:05.876 --> 00:51:09.236
This is Lambda equal to plus
minus two.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9465-0
00:51:08.536 --> 00:51:09.286
Listening is to.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9466-0
00:51:08.856 --> 00:51:09.096
2.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9471-0
00:51:09.506 --> 00:51:12.386
You can have plus minus of a
quantity.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9474-0
00:51:16.436 --> 00:51:16.716
Agree.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9478-0
00:51:18.416 --> 00:51:18.656
Yep.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9489-0
00:51:20.156 --> 00:51:23.976
You can also construct an
equation where you have a.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9487-0
00:51:21.786 --> 00:51:22.006
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9496-0
00:51:28.656 --> 00:51:31.906
I will construct another uh,
matrix.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9508-0
00:51:34.256 --> 00:51:38.256
Let's say yeah, but you know
this construction.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9515-0
00:51:42.396 --> 00:51:43.106
Good Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9519-0
00:51:44.036 --> 00:51:45.916
No double root construction.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9529-0
00:51:45.926 --> 00:51:49.006
Do you know this is very easy to
construct it?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9536-0
00:51:49.166 --> 00:51:50.336
This is a four.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9540-0
00:51:50.686 --> 00:51:52.416
There is a minus Lambda.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9554-0
00:51:52.476 --> 00:51:54.476
This is a -, 4 Lambda.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9553-0
00:51:52.656 --> 00:51:53.256
Latest there.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9576-0
00:51:54.586 --> 00:51:59.815
So when you multiply them you
will get a Lambda square minus 4

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9576-1
00:51:59.815 --> 00:52:02.056
Lambda, and this is a -, 2.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9592-0
00:52:02.096 --> 00:52:06.296
This is a two, so if you want
this kind of a matrix you take.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9626-0
00:52:06.336 --> 00:52:11.200
If you want to get this kind of
characteristic equation, you

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9626-1
00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:15.586
take A to B, you take A to B,
yeah, 0 -, 2, two, four.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9631-0
00:52:17.066 --> 00:52:18.166
Let me take this matrix.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9641-0
00:52:22.256 --> 00:52:23.516
Can I take this matrix A?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9650-0
00:52:22.666 --> 00:52:24.536
Yep, yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9673-0
00:52:24.916 --> 00:52:28.360
Now in this matrix, if you work
out the currency equation will

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9659-0
00:52:25.526 --> 00:52:25.686
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9673-1
00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:30.546
be minus Lambda minus 224 minus
Lambda.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9683-0
00:52:30.756 --> 00:52:33.076
If you take the determinant of
this, what will you get?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9700-0
00:52:33.086 --> 00:52:38.419
Determinant is nothing but minus
Lambda into 4 minus Lambda plus

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9700-1
00:52:38.419 --> 00:52:39.486
4 equal to 0.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9714-0
00:52:39.746 --> 00:52:42.886
This is Lambda squared minus 4
Lambda for four equal to 0.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9728-0
00:52:42.896 --> 00:52:45.246
This is Lambda minus 2, the
whole square equal to 0.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9736-0
00:52:45.436 --> 00:52:48.666
So Lambda Lambda 1 equal to two
and Lambda 2 equal to two.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9740-0
00:52:53.936 --> 00:52:54.196
Agree.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9744-0
00:52:54.806 --> 00:52:55.026
Yep.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9751-0
00:52:55.946 --> 00:52:58.016
So you can have repeating
eigenvalues.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9764-0
00:52:58.146 --> 00:53:01.824
One can be the negative of the
other or they can be totally

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9764-1
00:53:01.824 --> 00:53:02.376
distinct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9767-0
00:53:02.446 --> 00:53:02.996
They can be.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9791-0
00:53:03.496 --> 00:53:07.558
And they can be complex, but
only thing is if it is complex,

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9791-1
00:53:07.558 --> 00:53:09.956
they will occur as conjugate
pairs.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9814-0
00:53:10.246 --> 00:53:18.469
That means if yeah, plus IB is a
root of gathered seek equation,

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9814-1
00:53:18.469 --> 00:53:21.126
A minus ID will also.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9817-0
00:53:24.066 --> 00:53:24.386
Yellow.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9820-0
00:53:27.146 --> 00:53:27.406
Agree.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9826-0
00:53:29.016 --> 00:53:29.236
Yep.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9833-0
00:53:30.456 --> 00:53:30.956
Yes, but.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9846-0
00:53:30.546 --> 00:53:33.996
OK, so you you can you can
verify that and that should not

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9846-1
00:53:33.996 --> 00:53:34.756
be a problem.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9866-0
00:53:35.146 --> 00:53:39.073
Now, having told all these, I've
told you, Chris George and Sarah

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9866-1
00:53:39.073 --> 00:53:41.156
may have told you this part of
it.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9905-0
00:53:42.016 --> 00:53:45.483
I have told you one or two
properties so now with this

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9905-1
00:53:45.483 --> 00:53:49.454
you'll be able to calculate the
eigenvalues, eigenvectors that

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9905-2
00:53:49.454 --> 00:53:51.786
and then you can do a lot of
things.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9916-0
00:53:51.876 --> 00:53:58.536
Now there is one small bit which
needs to be shown now.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9922-0
00:54:00.446 --> 00:54:01.596
This is a theorem actually.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9925-0
00:54:03.626 --> 00:54:04.336
UM.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9933-0
00:54:07.156 --> 00:54:08.916
The theorem states uh.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9936-0
00:54:10.006 --> 00:54:11.146
Something like if.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9943-0
00:54:13.236 --> 00:54:15.626
Uh, if, yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9949-0
00:54:17.906 --> 00:54:18.896
Transpose.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9960-0
00:54:18.906 --> 00:54:24.176
Conjugate conjugate transpose is
equal to a.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9965-0
00:54:25.036 --> 00:54:27.036
This matrix is called Hermitian.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9971-0
00:54:30.796 --> 00:54:31.806
This is symmetric.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9991-0
00:54:31.816 --> 00:54:36.278
This is parallel to symmetric,
but this is for example which

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9991-1
00:54:36.278 --> 00:54:38.326
happens in the complex case.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/9999-0
00:54:38.856 --> 00:54:42.706
Now, what is this the a bar?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10015-0
00:54:42.806 --> 00:54:46.506
This is basically wherever you
have an A+ IB.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10025-0
00:54:46.516 --> 00:54:49.446
You rate the conjugate of it in
the matrix as a -.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10028-0
00:54:49.456 --> 00:54:50.016
IB OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10046-0
00:54:54.076 --> 00:54:55.036
But can you please repeat?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10065-0
00:54:55.686 --> 00:55:03.496
So if they have a matrix one
plus I2 plus I3 minus I 4 -, I.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10088-0
00:55:04.106 --> 00:55:08.751
If you want, if this is, you're
going to be your gay, what is a

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10088-1
00:55:08.751 --> 00:55:10.856
conjugate is nothing but 1 -.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10099-0
00:55:10.866 --> 00:55:15.546
I2 minus I3 plus I and 4 + I.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10131-0
00:55:18.836 --> 00:55:22.009
OK, so so this will come within
case of complex numbers

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10117-0
00:55:19.306 --> 00:55:19.946
The the.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10131-1
00:55:22.009 --> 00:55:22.576
conjugate.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10124-0
00:55:22.126 --> 00:55:22.836
Yeah, this is good.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10140-0
00:55:22.846 --> 00:55:26.296
This is going to come otherwise
if there is no complex number.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10145-0
00:55:26.306 --> 00:55:27.806
This is same as symmetric.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10146-0
00:55:29.236 --> 00:55:29.676
OK so.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10149-0
00:55:31.416 --> 00:55:31.766
Agreed.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10158-0
00:55:33.996 --> 00:55:35.436
You've all numbers are real.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10171-0
00:55:35.446 --> 00:55:38.487
This bar is superfluous and then
you will get a symmetric matrix,

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10171-1
00:55:38.487 --> 00:55:38.856
correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10179-0
00:55:41.796 --> 00:55:42.026
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10224-0
00:55:43.006 --> 00:55:48.076
So this is only the case where
you have a Hermitian matrix

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10224-1
00:55:48.076 --> 00:55:53.060
where if you take first to the
the conjugate and then the

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10224-2
00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:58.645
transpose you get back the same
a same matrix A that is called a

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10224-3
00:55:58.645 --> 00:56:00.106
Hermitian matrix.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10241-0
00:56:00.116 --> 00:56:03.687
This is an extension of what we
did for the symmetric message

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10241-1
00:56:03.687 --> 00:56:04.206
matrices.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10244-0
00:56:04.216 --> 00:56:05.256
In the real case, OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10248-0
00:56:12.116 --> 00:56:12.596
Pardon.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10257-0
00:56:14.676 --> 00:56:15.896
So that if we transpose this.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10377-0
00:56:15.966 --> 00:56:16.086
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10261-0
00:56:17.306 --> 00:56:17.916
A bar.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10266-0
00:56:17.926 --> 00:56:18.956
Uh, this metric?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10285-0
00:56:18.966 --> 00:56:21.546
Then we won't get uh E you.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10283-0
00:56:20.936 --> 00:56:22.866
I never said this is Hermitian.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10312-0
00:56:23.376 --> 00:56:27.466
I am saying this is how you get
a a a a bar.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10294-0
00:56:23.486 --> 00:56:24.096
OK, OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10299-0
00:56:24.466 --> 00:56:25.196
Yeah, got it.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10305-0
00:56:25.206 --> 00:56:26.156
Got it, got it.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10311-0
00:56:26.166 --> 00:56:26.426
Got it.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10323-0
00:56:30.946 --> 00:56:31.246
Agree.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10330-0
00:56:31.166 --> 00:56:33.016
Conjugate conjugate metrics.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10328-0
00:56:31.876 --> 00:56:32.496
Got it, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10338-0
00:56:33.696 --> 00:56:35.706
This is a conjugate matrix of a.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10347-0
00:56:35.756 --> 00:56:37.686
I never said it is going to be
this.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10379-0
00:56:37.856 --> 00:56:41.495
I am saying a bar transpose if
it is equal to a then I am

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10379-1
00:56:41.495 --> 00:56:45.386
saying that this is going to be
something called as Hermitian

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10379-2
00:56:45.386 --> 00:56:46.076
matrix. OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10388-0
00:56:50.806 --> 00:56:51.086
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10393-0
00:56:51.696 --> 00:56:52.446
OK, fine.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10391-0
00:56:51.736 --> 00:56:52.236
Yes if.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10395-0
00:56:51.846 --> 00:56:52.236
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10419-0
00:56:52.776 --> 00:56:57.606
Now the point is if whether you
consider a symmetric matrix or a

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10419-1
00:56:57.606 --> 00:57:00.876
Hermitian matrix, as the case
may be tigon.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10425-0
00:57:03.366 --> 00:57:04.366
Bad news are yet.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10427-0
00:57:09.176 --> 00:57:09.456
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10444-0
00:57:14.576 --> 00:57:19.466
You can even have a complex
matrix as long as it is

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10444-1
00:57:19.466 --> 00:57:20.406
Hermitian.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10448-0
00:57:21.636 --> 00:57:22.076
Now you can.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10452-0
00:57:22.086 --> 00:57:23.076
Values are always real.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10459-0
00:57:28.856 --> 00:57:29.136
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10462-0
00:57:30.576 --> 00:57:31.766
Can you take an example, Sir?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10480-0
00:57:34.426 --> 00:57:36.786
Should they prove it or take an
example and show it?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10486-0
00:57:37.916 --> 00:57:39.246
Example is fine Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10496-0
00:57:38.126 --> 00:57:40.286
Example would be sufficiently.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10497-0
00:57:39.376 --> 00:57:40.996
No, no proof is not required.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10509-0
00:57:44.076 --> 00:57:49.466
So 1224 to 8 is the symmetric.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10524-0
00:57:52.766 --> 00:57:53.126
It is.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10528-0
00:57:53.216 --> 00:57:53.616
Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10535-0
00:57:53.586 --> 00:57:54.166
Yes, yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10530-0
00:57:54.626 --> 00:57:55.496
How do you calculate the?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10541-0
00:57:55.496 --> 00:57:56.396
Eigenvalues of that.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10547-0
00:57:56.406 --> 00:57:57.436
Can you do it using Octave?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10548-0
00:57:58.816 --> 00:57:59.196
Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10555-0
00:58:03.096 --> 00:58:05.766
AE equal to 1/2.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10561-0
00:58:07.786 --> 00:58:08.026
Eight.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10569-0
00:58:09.836 --> 00:58:13.756
Just saying, I got three real
numbers, OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10574-0
00:58:19.566 --> 00:58:19.956
Product.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10578-0
00:58:21.116 --> 00:58:21.476
Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10577-0
00:58:21.226 --> 00:58:21.356
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10579-0
00:58:22.536 --> 00:58:22.656
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10593-0
00:58:26.276 --> 00:58:29.806
Now it doesn't mean that the
converse cannot be true.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10599-0
00:58:29.856 --> 00:58:33.116
You can have for example.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10611-0
00:58:37.296 --> 00:58:42.246
Non symmetric matrices which can
also have real eigenvalues.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10616-0
00:58:48.006 --> 00:58:48.346
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10621-0
00:58:48.956 --> 00:58:49.816
Yeah, makes sense.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10633-0
00:58:50.226 --> 00:58:54.096
So 111 statement is true is if
it is symmetric.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10648-0
00:58:54.106 --> 00:58:57.143
I can close my eyes and say the
eigen values will always be

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10648-1
00:58:57.143 --> 00:58:57.396
real.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10652-0
00:58:59.256 --> 00:58:59.676
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10670-0
00:58:59.526 --> 00:59:04.410
OK, but that doesn't mean that
if some matrix is not symmetric,

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10670-1
00:59:04.410 --> 00:59:07.386
that it's eigenvalues will be
complex.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10674-0
00:59:09.376 --> 00:59:09.736
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10682-0
00:59:11.026 --> 00:59:12.866
So you you have to be very
careful about it.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10685-0
00:59:14.556 --> 00:59:15.006
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10704-0
00:59:15.396 --> 00:59:20.793
And the proof is not all that
great that we can get it done,

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10704-1
00:59:20.793 --> 00:59:21.766
but I will.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10709-0
00:59:21.116 --> 00:59:21.346
What?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10713-0
00:59:21.836 --> 00:59:22.876
I'll reserve it for now.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10757-0
00:59:24.586 --> 00:59:29.310
Now, can I go through the slides
for you for for me to tell you

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10757-1
00:59:29.310 --> 00:59:32.706
what are the jargons available
in this thing?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10755-0
00:59:33.506 --> 00:59:34.186
Yes, Sir. Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10759-0
00:59:33.766 --> 00:59:35.196
Please please please please.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10772-0
00:59:33.796 --> 00:59:39.856
And so one is this determinant
of a minus Lambda I.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10761-0
00:59:34.566 --> 00:59:35.066
Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10776-0
00:59:39.926 --> 00:59:41.906
This is called the
characteristic polynomial.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10778-0
00:59:44.436 --> 00:59:44.656
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10793-0
00:59:48.756 --> 00:59:51.604
This determinant of a minus
Lambda I this will be a

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10793-1
00:59:51.604 --> 00:59:52.206
polynomial.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10802-0
00:59:52.216 --> 00:59:54.066
This is called the
characteristic polynomial.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10813-0
00:59:54.556 --> 00:59:57.018
The moment you equate it to
zero, it is called the

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10813-1
00:59:57.018 --> 00:59:58.176
characteristic equation.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10815-0
01:00:02.136 --> 01:00:02.436
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10817-0
01:00:04.456 --> 01:00:04.536
K.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10829-0
01:00:06.426 --> 01:00:08.916
OK, now you consider this three
by three.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10843-0
01:00:08.926 --> 01:00:13.346
This is just for your own
explanation, if I if I try to.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10861-0
01:00:15.696 --> 01:00:21.291
If I try to expand it, what will
be the power of Lambda maximum

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10861-1
01:00:21.291 --> 01:00:21.816
power?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10867-0
01:00:25.286 --> 01:00:25.486
Sorry.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10869-0
01:00:25.686 --> 01:00:25.886
You.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10880-0
01:00:26.406 --> 01:00:27.036
Lambda cube.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10885-0
01:00:26.996 --> 01:00:27.926
You 3.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10892-0
01:00:27.986 --> 01:00:28.526
I'm like you.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10896-0
01:00:28.536 --> 01:00:29.646
And what will be the
coefficient?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10903-0
01:00:35.486 --> 01:00:36.416
Diagonal elements.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10946-0
01:00:37.666 --> 01:00:42.576
Ohh if I expand it no no thing
thing thing thing thing.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10916-0
01:00:37.966 --> 01:00:38.866
Product of diagonal.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10924-0
01:00:38.786 --> 01:00:39.786
11.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10932-0
01:00:40.476 --> 01:00:40.996
11.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10944-0
01:00:41.306 --> 01:00:42.526
1 -.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10956-0
01:00:43.476 --> 01:00:44.676
They just play this one.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10969-0
01:00:43.716 --> 01:00:47.016
A11 into 82333.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10964-0
01:00:45.216 --> 01:00:45.756
Minus one.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10965-0
01:00:45.766 --> 01:00:47.006
Good minus one.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10995-0
01:00:47.516 --> 01:00:51.279
So the point is this minus one
will happen because there are

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/10995-1
01:00:51.279 --> 01:00:54.796
three terms, you get a minus
Lambda from the first term.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11011-0
01:00:54.806 --> 01:00:57.300
Your minus Lambda from the
second lamb and the minus Lambda

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11011-1
01:00:57.300 --> 01:00:58.506
from the third term, correct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11022-0
01:01:00.976 --> 01:01:01.676
Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11018-0
01:01:01.256 --> 01:01:01.456
Right.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11025-0
01:01:02.096 --> 01:01:02.516
Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11049-0
01:01:02.776 --> 01:01:07.598
So if Yeng is odd, you will get
the highest power to be Lambda

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11049-1
01:01:07.598 --> 01:01:10.506
cube with a coefficient of minus
one.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11067-0
01:01:11.056 --> 01:01:14.188
If Lambda is even, you will get
Lambda squared with the

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11067-1
01:01:14.188 --> 01:01:16.146
coefficient of plus one you
agree.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11068-0
01:01:17.366 --> 01:01:17.686
Correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11069-0
01:01:17.576 --> 01:01:17.846
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11081-0
01:01:19.686 --> 01:01:24.506
OK, so and what is this
expansion?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11084-0
01:01:24.516 --> 01:01:25.836
The expansion will give you.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11099-0
01:01:27.696 --> 01:01:30.266
A lot of terms now, what are
those terms?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11112-0
01:01:30.776 --> 01:01:33.286
You can very you have to very
carefully write it down.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11124-0
01:01:33.456 --> 01:01:38.176
The terms will be starting with
Lambda Q.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11133-0
01:01:38.326 --> 01:01:40.506
You will get Lambda squared
terms also correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11134-0
01:01:42.266 --> 01:01:42.376
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11145-0
01:01:47.346 --> 01:01:47.526
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11153-0
01:01:47.566 --> 01:01:51.746
Do you get Lambda squared terms
in the determinant?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11157-0
01:01:50.846 --> 01:01:51.246
He is.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11172-0
01:01:52.176 --> 01:01:56.026
You will get the Lambda asked
Lambda term also and you'll get

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11172-1
01:01:56.026 --> 01:01:57.516
a constant term correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11189-0
01:01:59.246 --> 01:01:59.896
But it's.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11181-0
01:01:59.426 --> 01:01:59.606
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11192-0
01:01:59.736 --> 01:02:00.406
Correct, Sir. Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11196-0
01:02:01.186 --> 01:02:02.536
Can you do it for two by two?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11202-0
01:02:02.686 --> 01:02:03.726
If this is complicated.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11205-0
01:02:04.516 --> 01:02:04.926
Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11210-0
01:02:05.436 --> 01:02:05.616
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11212-0
01:02:06.706 --> 01:02:07.606
What I'm saying is.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11240-0
01:02:11.136 --> 01:02:17.954
So I have my cousin polynomial,
my matrix A is nothing but

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11240-1
01:02:17.954 --> 01:02:19.456
A11A12A21A22.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11275-0
01:02:20.486 --> 01:02:27.103
Now with the Catholic polynomial
characteristic polynomial, this

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11275-1
01:02:27.103 --> 01:02:33.414
so we'll have the expansion like
the determinant of A11 minus

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11275-2
01:02:33.414 --> 01:02:37.486
Lambda A12A21A22 minus Lambda,
correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11285-0
01:02:40.466 --> 01:02:40.726
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11284-0
01:02:40.536 --> 01:02:40.846
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11292-0
01:02:41.246 --> 01:02:41.686
Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11317-0
01:02:41.896 --> 01:02:47.147
Now if we multiply then this
will be nothing but a 11 minus

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11317-1
01:02:47.147 --> 01:02:51.786
Lambda into a 22 minus Lambda
minus A12A21, correct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11330-0
01:02:54.146 --> 01:02:54.366
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11364-0
01:02:55.336 --> 01:03:03.447
If I expand this I will get a
11A22 minus A11 Lambda minus 822

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11335-0
01:02:55.666 --> 01:02:55.846
Right.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11334-0
01:02:55.786 --> 01:02:56.166
Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11364-1
01:03:03.447 --> 01:03:09.756
Lambda plus Lambda square minus
E12A21, correct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11373-0
01:03:13.396 --> 01:03:13.806
He is.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11391-0
01:03:14.946 --> 01:03:20.166
If I group these terms, it'll be
nothing but A11A22.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11383-0
01:03:15.186 --> 01:03:15.416
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11401-0
01:03:22.056 --> 01:03:26.926
Minus A12A21 minus.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11429-0
01:03:30.476 --> 01:03:36.368
I will have year one one plus a
2/2 times Lambda plus Lambda

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11429-1
01:03:36.368 --> 01:03:39.846
square into minus one whole
square.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11442-0
01:03:40.476 --> 01:03:43.076
I'm telling you the reason why I
put minus one hole square there.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11449-0
01:03:44.756 --> 01:03:45.306
Do you get this?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11450-0
01:03:46.336 --> 01:03:46.616
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11451-0
01:03:46.426 --> 01:03:46.746
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11463-0
01:03:54.356 --> 01:03:54.976
Yes, Sir. Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11475-0
01:03:55.856 --> 01:03:59.573
You'll get it this this way
right now this is called the

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11475-1
01:03:59.573 --> 01:04:00.486
constant term.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11481-0
01:04:00.496 --> 01:04:01.716
We call it as C0.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11503-0
01:04:03.446 --> 01:04:09.770
Now this entire term with the
negative, we call it C1 and this

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11503-1
01:04:09.770 --> 01:04:11.376
term we call C2.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11518-0
01:04:11.766 --> 01:04:16.468
So I would have got C not plus
C1 Lambda plus C2 Lambda

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11518-1
01:04:16.468 --> 01:04:17.896
squared, correct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11528-0
01:04:20.806 --> 01:04:21.316
Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11529-0

Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11541-0
01:04:23.046 --> 01:04:25.546
And so you know what she notice?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11557-0
01:04:25.616 --> 01:04:28.256
You know what C1 is and you know
what C2 is.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11578-0
01:04:28.706 --> 01:04:32.225
And if I say that this is the
the if I equate it to zero, I

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11578-1
01:04:32.225 --> 01:04:34.336
get the currency polynomial,
right?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11581-0
01:04:35.736 --> 01:04:35.886

01:04:37.256 --> 01:04:39.714
Now the roots of this
characteristic polynomial are

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11594-1
01:04:39.714 --> 01:04:41.416
basically the eigenvalues,
correct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11601-0
01:04:43.066 --> 01:04:43.906

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11618-0
01:04:44.786 --> 01:04:49.356
OK, so now now basically this is
from 8th, 9th standard.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11603-0
01:04:44.856 --> 01:04:45.016

01:05:47.946 --> 01:05:52.322
Hey, this is so if you add roots
you are going to get minus B by

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11911-1
01:05:52.322 --> 01:05:56.563
A and if you multiply the roots
of this you are going to get C

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11911-2
01:05:56.563 --> 01:06:00.804
by a because the roots are minus
V plus minus root of B square

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11911-3
01:06:00.804 --> 01:06:05.179
minus four AC by two a you take
one root as minus B plus and the

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11911-4
01:06:05.179 --> 01:06:07.266
other group does minus V minus.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11916-0
01:06:07.636 --> 01:06:08.896
Then you add both of them.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11927-0
01:06:08.906 --> 01:06:10.486
You will get a -, B by a.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11950-0
01:06:10.816 --> 01:06:14.305
If you multiply both of them,
get to see by a sign applying

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11950-1
01:06:14.305 --> 01:06:17.096
the same logic here, what is
some of the roots?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11987-0
01:06:17.546 --> 01:06:21.054
Some of the roots is basically
the coefficient of the linear

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11987-1
01:06:21.054 --> 01:06:24.275
term, but divided by the
coefficient of the square term

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11987-2
01:06:24.275 --> 01:06:27.783
for the coefficient linear time
is C1 and coefficient square

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/11987-3
01:06:27.783 --> 01:06:28.416
time is C2.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12004-0
01:06:28.466 --> 01:06:32.716
You know what is C1C1 is
negative of A11 plus A2A22.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12021-0
01:06:33.126 --> 01:06:37.296
So this is nothing but A11 plus
a 22 by 1, correct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12032-0
01:06:39.096 --> 01:06:39.356
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12047-0
01:06:40.086 --> 01:06:42.456
Which is nothing but A11 plus
A22.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12039-0
01:06:40.336 --> 01:06:40.616
So.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12072-0
01:06:42.666 --> 01:06:46.614
Some of the roots Lambda one
plus Lambda 2 will be equal to

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12063-0
01:06:43.056 --> 01:06:44.426
I'm not from diagonal elements.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12072-1
01:06:46.614 --> 01:06:47.996
A11 plus A22 correct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12082-0
01:06:48.226 --> 01:06:48.766
I proved that.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12091-0
01:06:49.716 --> 01:06:50.426
He is.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12092-0
01:06:50.616 --> 01:06:52.126
What is the product of the route
Sir?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12104-0
01:06:55.776 --> 01:06:57.286
He not by T2.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12125-0
01:06:57.946 --> 01:07:05.226
He, not BC2, which is nothing
but A11A22 minus A21A12 correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12137-0
01:07:07.926 --> 01:07:08.086
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12145-0
01:07:08.276 --> 01:07:09.316
This quarter, determinants.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12142-0
01:07:09.726 --> 01:07:10.626
Now, what is this?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12153-0
01:07:10.636 --> 01:07:12.156
This is the river determinant of
here, right?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12155-0
01:07:12.656 --> 01:07:13.036
Yes, yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12172-0
01:07:14.636 --> 01:07:17.949
So product of the roots Lambda
1, Lambda 2 who is determinant

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12172-1
01:07:17.949 --> 01:07:18.216
of a.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12190-0
01:07:19.066 --> 01:07:22.432
So these are the two things
which can be proved even for the

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12190-1
01:07:22.432 --> 01:07:23.756
higher dimensional case.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12217-0
01:07:25.536 --> 01:07:29.434
Now you will get minus one hold
power n -, 1 times trace of A

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12217-1
01:07:29.434 --> 01:07:31.886
and so on C not just determinant
of a.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12231-0
01:07:31.896 --> 01:07:35.306
So you can set all these things
and then you can do this.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12250-0
01:07:35.916 --> 01:07:38.197
OK, this is same thing which
people have done here

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12250-1
01:07:38.197 --> 01:07:39.986
differently and you they're
getting it.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12262-0
01:07:42.226 --> 01:07:44.456
OK, I have done all these
things.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12264-0
01:07:45.156 --> 01:07:45.686
Talk.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12266-0
01:07:46.306 --> 01:07:47.636
Talk. OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12286-0
01:07:49.626 --> 01:07:53.806
Uh, so, OK, now you try to
answer this, you have you have

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12286-1
01:07:53.806 --> 01:07:55.536
an idea now saying that.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12304-0
01:07:57.396 --> 01:08:03.086
Uh, you take the equation ax
equal to Lambda XI told you.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12321-0
01:08:03.096 --> 01:08:06.436
Did he tell you what happens
when you multiply a vector with

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12321-1
01:08:06.436 --> 01:08:07.586
an orthogonal matrix?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12323-0
01:08:07.906 --> 01:08:08.436
What happens?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12331-0
01:08:13.416 --> 01:08:14.546
Distance is preserved.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12337-0
01:08:15.446 --> 01:08:17.496
And only the angle gets rotated
right?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12343-0
01:08:18.156 --> 01:08:18.436
Correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12348-0
01:08:19.336 --> 01:08:19.966
Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12359-0
01:08:19.516 --> 01:08:24.021
OK, so so the point is, what are
the eigenvalues and

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12359-1
01:08:24.021 --> 01:08:25.126
eigenvectors?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12362-0
01:08:25.156 --> 01:08:26.516
Of an orthogonal matrix.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12381-0
01:08:30.136 --> 01:08:35.034
You multiply with any vector, it
will just rotate it by some

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12381-1
01:08:35.034 --> 01:08:35.516
angle.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12390-0
01:08:35.986 --> 01:08:39.546
So what are its eigenvalues and
eigenvectors?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12401-0
01:08:42.376 --> 01:08:43.656
Plus or minus one is it?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12404-0
01:08:45.436 --> 01:08:45.746
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12410-0
01:08:46.086 --> 01:08:47.676
Plus or minus one as what?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12422-0
01:08:49.946 --> 01:08:50.826
Are you getting my list?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12426-0
01:08:51.426 --> 01:08:53.176
Wait, wait.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12425-0
01:08:51.536 --> 01:08:52.286
I didn't values.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12438-0
01:09:00.546 --> 01:09:04.036
But yeah, the agent values plus
minus one.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12446-0
01:09:05.296 --> 01:09:08.216
Uh, who said plus minus one?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12458-0
01:09:09.276 --> 01:09:09.896
Great comma.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12467-0
01:09:10.896 --> 01:09:11.636
Good thing I said.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12462-0
01:09:10.976 --> 01:09:12.086
RADHIKA, who said that?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12493-0
01:09:12.256 --> 01:09:16.810
OK, Pritika then you should also
explain as to why we are getting

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12493-1
01:09:16.810 --> 01:09:17.776
this thing OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12501-0
01:09:17.526 --> 01:09:20.426
The because cost is 1 first
degree.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12498-0
01:09:18.606 --> 01:09:19.696
So some should be 0.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12497-0
01:09:18.716 --> 01:09:19.536
That because.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12502-0
01:09:20.626 --> 01:09:20.806
What?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12511-0
01:09:21.466 --> 01:09:23.276
Sir X is Lambda X, right?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12524-0
01:09:23.086 --> 01:09:25.376
Notice that he ain't do it
transports, no.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12522-0
01:09:23.286 --> 01:09:25.016
So if once you transform.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12538-0
01:09:27.226 --> 01:09:29.076
No, I am saying cakes. Eggs.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12550-0
01:09:27.546 --> 01:09:31.066
And once you transform X with a
yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12555-0
01:09:29.106 --> 01:09:35.846
Equal to Lambda X and I also say
that A is orthogonal.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12567-0
01:09:38.886 --> 01:09:39.136
Now.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12590-0
01:09:39.266 --> 01:09:43.693
City base after Gonal, then 88
transfers is equal to identity

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12578-0
01:09:41.156 --> 01:09:41.436
Ah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12590-1
01:09:43.693 --> 01:09:44.836
matrix so there.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12598-0
01:09:44.726 --> 01:09:47.326
Here in the A transpose equal
right demetric set.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12610-0
01:09:48.136 --> 01:09:50.346
You know from which we will get
better Lambda.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12619-0
01:09:51.066 --> 01:09:53.716
I only get your Lambda, so I am
doing.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12651-0
01:09:53.726 --> 01:09:57.994
I'm telling you that the intent
of this, OK you can you can do

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12637-0
01:09:57.206 --> 01:09:57.566
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12651-1
01:09:57.994 --> 01:10:02.126
it in too many ways, but I let
me try to tell you something.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12670-0
01:10:02.676 --> 01:10:06.995
So AAX equal to Lambda X is
there if I just transpose a X

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12670-1
01:10:06.995 --> 01:10:08.336
equal to Lambda X.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12676-0
01:10:12.066 --> 01:10:12.836
What do we get?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12699-0
01:10:12.906 --> 01:10:15.627
I will get something like this
will imply extrasport A

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12699-1
01:10:15.627 --> 01:10:18.496
transpose will be nothing but
Lambda X transpose correct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12708-0
01:10:20.356 --> 01:10:20.466
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12713-0
01:10:20.636 --> 01:10:21.056
Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12714-0
01:10:20.986 --> 01:10:21.606
Issue.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12725-0
01:10:22.256 --> 01:10:26.146
Now I will also have my X equal
to Lambda X as before, correct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12735-0
01:10:28.136 --> 01:10:28.236
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12743-0
01:10:28.546 --> 01:10:29.296
He issue.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12774-0
01:10:29.516 --> 01:10:33.533
If I multiply these two I will
get X transpose, A transpose a X

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12766-0
01:10:29.676 --> 01:10:29.816
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12774-1
01:10:33.533 --> 01:10:36.734
will be equal to Lambda X
transpose into Lambda X,

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12774-2
01:10:36.734 --> 01:10:37.236
correct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12787-0
01:10:40.036 --> 01:10:40.696
Yes, sure.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12790-0
01:10:41.246 --> 01:10:41.706
And.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12805-0
01:10:41.556 --> 01:10:45.746
No, A transpose is identity, so
this is extra spose X equal to.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12818-0
01:10:45.756 --> 01:10:48.498
This Lambda can be brought out
because this is scalar X

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12818-1
01:10:48.498 --> 01:10:49.086
transpose X.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12830-0
01:10:50.116 --> 01:10:53.146
Now my original account X is non
zero.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12840-0
01:10:53.236 --> 01:10:56.506
This implies X transpose X can
never be 0, correct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12847-0
01:10:59.566 --> 01:11:00.206
He is.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12850-0
01:11:00.366 --> 01:11:00.566
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12860-0
01:11:01.786 --> 01:11:04.796
Now so I can divide both extras
for 60 scalar.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12862-0
01:11:10.496 --> 01:11:10.596
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12868-0
01:11:12.726 --> 01:11:12.956
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12875-0
01:11:13.056 --> 01:11:13.606
Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12928-0
01:11:14.346 --> 01:11:17.664
So extra special Scala and this
extra space is Kayla, and it is

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12928-1
01:11:17.664 --> 01:11:20.411
nonzero, which means I can
divide on both sides by X

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12928-2
01:11:20.411 --> 01:11:23.833
transpose X, which will give you
1 equal to Lambda squared, which

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12928-3
01:11:23.833 --> 01:11:26.166
will give me Lambda equal to
plus minus one.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12939-0
01:11:32.386 --> 01:11:35.016
So can we also take norm on both
sides?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12958-0
01:11:35.026 --> 01:11:37.496
And then show Lambda equals to
plus minus one.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12952-0
01:11:38.086 --> 01:11:38.316
Why?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12966-0
01:11:38.326 --> 01:11:40.256
How would you take Norm on both
sides, Sir?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12976-0
01:11:40.586 --> 01:11:41.686
Basically, which norm?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12979-0
01:11:40.886 --> 01:11:43.816
To norm of AX is norm of Lambda
X.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/12983-0
01:11:44.636 --> 01:11:45.176
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13017-0
01:11:46.406 --> 01:11:49.911
And norm of X will be equal
since A is orthogonal norm of X

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13017-1
01:11:49.911 --> 01:11:53.416
is equals to norm of X and
Lambda is scalar that comes out.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13021-0
01:11:52.026 --> 01:11:52.206
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13027-0
01:11:53.426 --> 01:11:54.566
So Lambda norm of X.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13024-0
01:11:55.236 --> 01:11:55.566
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13037-0
01:11:55.576 --> 01:11:57.626
So that will give more mod
Lambda equal to 1.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13045-0
01:11:57.636 --> 01:11:58.476
Both are equal to only.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13054-0
01:11:59.466 --> 01:12:00.046
Correct, correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13052-0
01:12:00.496 --> 01:12:01.166
What are equal?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13067-0
01:12:01.176 --> 01:12:04.306
Next, transpose X is basically
the in the dot product X&amp;X.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13073-0
01:12:06.216 --> 01:12:07.006
Yeah, makes sense.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13080-0
01:12:08.296 --> 01:12:09.856
That is exactly the same method,
only.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13082-0
01:12:11.376 --> 01:12:11.986
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13086-0
01:12:12.056 --> 01:12:12.376
Thank you.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13109-0
01:12:12.966 --> 01:12:16.360
So you can do by various
methods, so you can find out

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13109-1
01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:18.686
that Lambda equal to plus minus
one.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13118-0
01:12:18.696 --> 01:12:20.026
That will be always the case.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13133-0
01:12:20.356 --> 01:12:25.801
So if somebody says you have an
ortho orthogonal matrix, what

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13133-1
01:12:25.801 --> 01:12:27.996
could be its determinant?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13139-0
01:12:34.386 --> 01:12:34.716
The zero.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13141-0
01:12:36.346 --> 01:12:36.656
Are they?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13144-0
01:12:36.666 --> 01:12:36.816
Bye.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13146-0
01:12:36.826 --> 01:12:37.056
Bye.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13158-0
01:12:37.066 --> 01:12:38.696
You're not playing your mind.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13192-0
01:12:39.306 --> 01:12:42.486
I told you determinant of the
matrix determinant of a matrix.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13190-0
01:12:39.376 --> 01:12:42.026
Minus 1 -, 1.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13191-0
01:12:40.076 --> 01:12:42.176
Minus 1 -, 1.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13198-0
01:12:40.346 --> 01:12:42.926
171 Sir 11.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13205-0
01:12:43.526 --> 01:12:45.956
It can either be a + 1 or minus
one, huh.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13223-0
01:12:46.886 --> 01:12:49.680
See, there can be some where I
can values which can be plus

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13223-1
01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:49.866
one.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13242-0
01:12:49.876 --> 01:12:52.567
There can be some eigenvalues
which can be minus one and

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13242-1
01:12:52.567 --> 01:12:55.353
determinate is nothing but
product of all the eigenvalues,

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13242-2
01:12:55.353 --> 01:12:55.636
right?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13251-0
01:12:58.586 --> 01:12:58.866
Right.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13248-0
01:12:59.596 --> 01:12:59.916
That's it.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13262-0
01:12:59.926 --> 01:13:03.176
The eigenvalues are plus one and
minus one in this case.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13269-0
01:13:03.186 --> 01:13:04.706
So won't it be minus one?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13283-0
01:13:06.306 --> 01:13:09.956
No, no, I am saying Lambda has
only two possibilities.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13314-0
01:13:09.966 --> 01:13:13.731
If I give you 10 cross 10
orthogonal matrix and ask you

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13314-1
01:13:13.731 --> 01:13:17.765
what this eigenvalues are, then
the then the answer is very

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13314-2
01:13:17.765 --> 01:13:18.236
simple.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13349-0
01:13:18.306 --> 01:13:21.610
They can either be plus one or
minus one, so the first one can

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13325-0
01:13:18.446 --> 01:13:19.526
He hasn't got it.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13349-1
01:13:21.610 --> 01:13:24.861
be either plus one or minus one
second one can be plus one or

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13349-2
01:13:24.861 --> 01:13:25.386
minus one.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13373-0
01:13:25.846 --> 01:13:29.512
Ultimately, if you multiply all
these eigenvalues, you can

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13373-1
01:13:29.512 --> 01:13:31.936
either get a + 1 or minus one
correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13376-0
01:13:33.126 --> 01:13:33.506
That it's.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13389-0
01:13:34.316 --> 01:13:38.636
So determinant value is either a
+ 1 or a -, 1 but it.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13397-0
01:13:40.986 --> 01:13:41.506
He is.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13431-0
01:13:42.026 --> 01:13:42.176
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13406-0
01:13:42.246 --> 01:13:44.696
OK, so that is how you prove it.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13427-0
01:13:44.826 --> 01:13:48.408
Now a similar proof is there for
proving that the say Diagon

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13427-1
01:13:48.408 --> 01:13:50.816
values of a symmetric matrices
are real.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13434-0
01:13:50.866 --> 01:13:51.646
Should we attempt it?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13441-0
01:13:52.986 --> 01:13:54.376
Uh, we can do that as an
exercise.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13447-0
01:13:56.036 --> 01:13:56.376
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13453-0
01:13:58.136 --> 01:13:59.696
Do people wanted 2-3 minute
break?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13464-0
01:14:04.096 --> 01:14:05.826
There will class will be
continued.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13463-0
01:14:04.206 --> 01:14:04.396
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13480-0
01:14:09.476 --> 01:14:11.976
VENKATA can you please scroll up
a bit you or not?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13489-0
01:14:13.786 --> 01:14:16.906
A a bit more hot.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13516-0
01:14:16.916 --> 01:14:20.548
Yeah, but so here the solutions
for this particular equation C

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13516-1
01:14:20.548 --> 01:14:23.776
not plus C1 Lambda plus C2
Lambda square equal to zero.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13522-0
01:14:24.306 --> 01:14:24.486
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13537-0
01:14:24.706 --> 01:14:28.000
Ah, how are they at the Eagan
vectors of this particular

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13537-1
01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:29.156
polynomial equation?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13548-0
01:14:29.226 --> 01:14:30.126
Characteristic polynomial.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13540-0
01:14:29.336 --> 01:14:30.046
I'm not.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13545-0
01:14:30.086 --> 01:14:31.166
I'm not talking about.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13556-0
01:14:31.886 --> 01:14:32.156
At all.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13564-0
01:14:33.106 --> 01:14:33.946
Sorry again values.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13572-0
01:14:34.486 --> 01:14:37.236
Are you getting values because
they are solution of Lambda.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13584-0
01:14:37.626 --> 01:14:42.926
I am trying to solve this matrix
minus Lambda times.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13587-0
01:14:42.936 --> 01:14:44.036
I equal to 0.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13604-0
01:14:44.046 --> 01:14:47.036
So whatever solution I get, they
are the eigenvalues.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13618-0
01:14:47.346 --> 01:14:48.376
That's the definition, right?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13610-0
01:14:48.006 --> 01:14:48.476
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13621-0
01:14:48.546 --> 01:14:50.356
OK, you're doing a minus Lambda.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13624-0
01:14:50.406 --> 01:14:50.876
OK, OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13645-0
01:14:50.826 --> 01:14:52.886
Yeah, determinant of a minus
Lambda equal to 0.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13635-0
01:14:50.886 --> 01:14:51.056
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13647-0
01:14:51.066 --> 01:14:54.426
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, I
I missed it.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13651-0
01:14:54.436 --> 01:14:54.926
Yeah. Thanks.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13661-0
01:14:55.796 --> 01:14:59.116
Speaker, do we take a 2-3 minute
break?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13677-0
01:14:59.156 --> 01:15:02.476
I just want to grab something
and I'm feeling hungry.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13703-0
01:15:02.926 --> 01:15:05.546
So can you give me exact OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13683-0
01:15:03.026 --> 01:15:03.506
Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13709-0
01:15:03.516 --> 01:15:05.656
Yeah, yeah, yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13706-0
01:15:03.736 --> 01:15:05.826
Yes, yes, yes, VENKATA Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13719-0
01:15:05.036 --> 01:15:06.076
And just just.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13747-0
01:15:05.836 --> 01:15:09.316
Even I want to have some yeah,
Biobrick.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13725-0
01:15:06.326 --> 01:15:07.216
Yes, please, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13734-0
01:15:06.806 --> 01:15:07.606
No, I said sure.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13738-0
01:15:07.396 --> 01:15:09.646
I I I will take exactly 30
seconds.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13735-0
01:15:07.846 --> 01:15:08.136
Go ahead.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13742-0
01:15:10.056 --> 01:15:10.646
I'm there.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13762-0
01:15:10.276 --> 01:15:12.116
Happy, miss it.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13757-0
01:15:10.716 --> 01:15:11.946
I am not putting on mute.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13769-0
01:15:11.956 --> 01:15:12.706
I'm back in a minute.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13774-0
01:15:13.466 --> 01:15:13.946
Sure, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13775-0
01:15:14.086 --> 01:15:15.056
Fines, applets.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13811-0
01:16:25.276 --> 01:16:27.646
Meanwhile, the.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13810-0
01:16:26.706 --> 01:16:27.236
I am back.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13824-0
01:16:31.216 --> 01:16:31.696
I'm back.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13817-0
01:16:31.566 --> 01:16:32.516
Of yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13819-0
01:16:32.526 --> 01:16:32.706
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13841-0
01:16:32.716 --> 01:16:36.313
So just a thought of asking, uh,
is there any training material

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13841-1
01:16:36.313 --> 01:16:37.156
for the octave?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13863-0
01:16:37.306 --> 01:16:40.246
And I thought of calling the
assignment using Octave so.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13852-0
01:16:38.076 --> 01:16:38.596
Is it?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13865-0
01:16:41.106 --> 01:16:42.386
We know what do you want to do
in Octave.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13914-0
01:16:45.416 --> 01:16:50.746
Write the coding for the well
you decomposition and ref. Uh.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13899-0
01:16:50.456 --> 01:16:53.326
No, you you, your voice is not
very clear to me.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13910-0
01:16:53.336 --> 01:16:55.006
You tell me what you want to do
with optimal.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13922-0
01:16:55.016 --> 01:16:55.696
Do it with update.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13933-0
01:16:56.576 --> 01:17:00.250
But then you execute one mile Lu
decomposition problem and

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13933-1
01:17:00.250 --> 01:17:00.686
active.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13938-0
01:17:03.586 --> 01:17:03.906
Right now.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13942-0
01:17:05.366 --> 01:17:06.346
Yeah, maybe after this class.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13950-0
01:17:08.136 --> 01:17:11.616
OK, but you can't input those.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13957-0
01:17:11.626 --> 01:17:16.206
Uh, those formulas in in Octave?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13968-0
01:17:18.716 --> 01:17:19.676
How should I, you, you.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13975-0
01:17:18.846 --> 01:17:19.126
Another.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13971-0
01:17:19.686 --> 01:17:20.136
You are you.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13990-0
01:17:20.146 --> 01:17:22.796
You just want me to run through
the syntax for Octave.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/13994-0
01:17:23.336 --> 01:17:25.016
You have syntax and trying to
solve the assignment.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14010-0
01:17:25.026 --> 01:17:27.901
Do you think after so just
looking for some training middle

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14010-1
01:17:27.901 --> 01:17:28.476
of guidance.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14017-0
01:17:28.486 --> 01:17:30.686
So for this one, mainly for Lu
decomposition.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14035-0
01:17:30.936 --> 01:17:35.304
So you'll use the active for
referring RREF but not for live

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14035-1
01:17:35.304 --> 01:17:36.306
reputation so.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14041-0
01:17:37.866 --> 01:17:38.446
No, you.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14043-0
01:17:38.456 --> 01:17:39.686
No, no, no.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14067-0
01:17:41.096 --> 01:17:45.036
Do you want to know how to rate
far loop if statements, etcetera

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14067-1
01:17:45.036 --> 01:17:46.006
in in in Octave?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14081-0
01:17:45.406 --> 01:17:47.906
Yes, yes, yes, yes, that's all.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14086-0
01:17:46.016 --> 01:17:46.866
Or what is the problem?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14090-0
01:17:47.986 --> 01:17:49.586
That is OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14095-0
01:17:47.986 --> 01:17:49.156
That's all I want, yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14108-0
01:17:49.636 --> 01:17:56.616
I'll solve it immediately for I
equal to 1 to 5 uh.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14113-0
01:17:56.626 --> 01:17:58.626
You just say whatever you want.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14116-0
01:18:03.246 --> 01:18:03.566
Display.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14122-0
01:18:06.346 --> 01:18:09.516
My name is thank you.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14129-0
01:18:13.066 --> 01:18:15.086
And this is for loop.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14131-0
01:18:17.616 --> 01:18:17.766
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14142-0
01:18:20.466 --> 01:18:25.926
If uh, I equal to equal to 5.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14147-0
01:18:28.606 --> 01:18:29.586
You write something.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14152-0
01:18:33.006 --> 01:18:35.226
Uh display.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14163-0
01:18:38.446 --> 01:18:42.796
Seeing that codes the value of I
is.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14168-0
01:18:46.666 --> 01:18:47.506
Are you one day?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14171-0
01:18:50.636 --> 01:18:51.086
Yeah, it's.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14176-0
01:18:53.466 --> 01:18:53.836
Display.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14185-0
01:18:56.086 --> 01:19:00.776
The value I it's not for you.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14199-0
01:19:08.116 --> 01:19:10.296
His aid value, by used by only.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14204-0
01:19:11.286 --> 01:19:11.486
So.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14205-0
01:19:11.546 --> 01:19:12.396
Why do you think right?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14234-0
01:19:17.206 --> 01:19:19.106
Because I could I equal to 1?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14239-0
01:19:17.436 --> 01:19:19.376
Said one question on Lud
composition.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14231-0
01:19:17.516 --> 01:19:20.396
Why is it wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14237-0
01:19:20.526 --> 01:19:21.286
Why is it for you?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14245-0
01:19:21.296 --> 01:19:22.416
Why did it display value?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14254-0
01:19:22.426 --> 01:19:22.986
Why is fine?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14295-0
01:19:24.126 --> 01:19:26.776
It retains the values of
previous command.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14275-0
01:19:24.706 --> 01:19:25.296
Because it.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14289-0
01:19:25.516 --> 01:19:26.896
Is written as I equal to 5.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14318-0
01:19:26.166 --> 01:19:28.646
If it comes with.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14346-0
01:19:27.066 --> 01:19:30.698
And the furlough, why is already
assigned to file the formula

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14319-0
01:19:27.106 --> 01:19:28.736
I think committed to files.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14349-0
01:19:27.806 --> 01:19:31.286
The last value of I calculated
in the previous one is 57.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14322-0
01:19:28.746 --> 01:19:29.826
That's why I.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14342-0
01:19:29.646 --> 01:19:30.256
Ah for.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14344-0
01:19:29.926 --> 01:19:30.436
For look.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14346-1
01:19:30.698 --> 01:19:32.456
last identified question file.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14360-0
01:19:31.996 --> 01:19:34.246
Ah yeah, for I equal to Phi I.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14365-0
01:19:34.256 --> 01:19:35.266
That was your what?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14388-0
01:19:35.316 --> 01:19:38.531
My for loop returned so when I
said I equal to five it returned

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14388-1
01:19:38.531 --> 01:19:39.586
I equal to five only.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14391-0
01:19:39.596 --> 01:19:40.106
OK. Please.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14397-0
01:19:40.116 --> 01:19:41.486
Next question or?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14427-0
01:19:42.576 --> 01:19:46.041
So far, Lu decomposition, is it
necessary the elementary

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14412-0
01:19:44.956 --> 01:19:45.176
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14427-1
01:19:46.041 --> 01:19:49.385
matrices are unit lower
triangular or they can be just

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14427-2
01:19:49.385 --> 01:19:50.236
the diagonals?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14442-0
01:19:50.246 --> 01:19:51.786
Can be something other than one
also.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14438-0
01:19:51.866 --> 01:19:52.416
No, no, no.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14459-0
01:19:52.566 --> 01:19:56.076
You have to necessarily take
them to be you need and.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14462-0
01:19:56.986 --> 01:19:57.886
Lower triangular, right?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14464-0
01:19:57.996 --> 01:19:58.176
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14509-0
01:19:59.396 --> 01:20:02.704
So because in some of the swap
operation for elementary

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14509-1
01:20:02.704 --> 01:20:06.071
operation is that will cause the
metrics to be non lower

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14509-2
01:20:06.071 --> 01:20:09.556
triangular and any of the
multiply operation will cause it

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14501-0
01:20:07.336 --> 01:20:08.186
Yeah, that's the reason.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14509-3
01:20:09.556 --> 01:20:11.446
to be non unit lower triangular.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14538-0
01:20:11.456 --> 01:20:14.436
So we can only use the ohh
multiplier row and add to

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14538-1
01:20:14.436 --> 01:20:16.066
another row operation, right?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14536-0
01:20:16.756 --> 01:20:17.276
Ah, yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14543-0
01:20:17.286 --> 01:20:17.726
Correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14569-0
01:20:17.736 --> 01:20:21.980
But if if you're unable to avoid
the multiplication, you can use

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14569-1
01:20:21.980 --> 01:20:24.396
multiplication. That
multiplication.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14578-0
01:20:23.356 --> 01:20:25.276
OK, then still it it would still
work.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14583-0
01:20:24.826 --> 01:20:29.376
Yeah, only one one that only for
that particular one.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14596-0
01:20:29.386 --> 01:20:32.236
That particular row it will have
that multiple, right?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14617-0
01:20:33.086 --> 01:20:33.906
Yeah, correct. Correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14607-0
01:20:34.116 --> 01:20:34.786
That should not be.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14621-0
01:20:34.796 --> 01:20:36.496
That should not be able to cause
a problem.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14624-0
01:20:38.086 --> 01:20:38.726
OK, OK, sure.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14625-0
01:20:39.556 --> 01:20:39.676
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14631-0
01:20:44.946 --> 01:20:45.976
So can we continue now?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14642-0
01:20:48.346 --> 01:20:49.376
So excuse me, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14654-0
01:20:49.386 --> 01:20:51.536
People are asking what is the
time to finish?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14651-0
01:20:49.786 --> 01:20:49.916
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14662-0
01:20:51.546 --> 01:20:53.056
Will you finish the session?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14672-0
01:20:53.106 --> 01:20:54.566
Is it till 10 or some?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14697-0
01:20:54.916 --> 01:21:01.136
No, no, I think we I have to
just go through the slides and

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14697-1
01:21:01.136 --> 01:21:04.246
maybe can you wind up by 9:45.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14709-0
01:21:06.676 --> 01:21:07.136
Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14713-0
01:21:07.326 --> 01:21:08.616
OK, Sir, I'll post it to.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14718-0
01:21:09.206 --> 01:21:09.886
OK, fine.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14720-0
01:21:10.406 --> 01:21:10.856
Example.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14733-0
01:21:11.476 --> 01:21:17.836
OK, now to corresponding to
every Lambda you can.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14750-0
01:21:17.986 --> 01:21:22.412
So if you find 1 Lambda that's
an eigenvalue, you find out all

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14750-1
01:21:22.412 --> 01:21:23.606
the eigenvectors.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14760-0
01:21:25.436 --> 01:21:28.326
And you add zero to that.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14775-0
01:21:28.396 --> 01:21:31.403
That will be called as icon
space of a with respect to

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14775-1
01:21:31.403 --> 01:21:31.786
Lambda.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14782-0
01:21:31.796 --> 01:21:33.336
It is called E of Lambda.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14807-0
01:21:34.536 --> 01:21:39.774
Now the the other jargon is the
set of all eigenvalues of a is

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14807-1
01:21:39.774 --> 01:21:40.356
called.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14823-0
01:21:40.366 --> 01:21:45.358
The spectrum of a now this is
very important for us in the in

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14823-1
01:21:45.358 --> 01:21:46.566
the later part.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14830-0
01:21:48.906 --> 01:21:51.946
OK, now in this case.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14861-0
01:21:56.336 --> 01:22:01.131
If you take the identity matrix,
it has only one eigenvalue

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14861-1
01:22:01.131 --> 01:22:05.926
Lambda equal to 1 and and the
eigenspace is basically RENI.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14866-0
01:22:06.296 --> 01:22:07.276
You know the reason, right?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14874-0
01:22:08.096 --> 01:22:09.496
Why is eigenspace Iran?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14887-0
01:22:14.896 --> 01:22:17.456
Because the increase in metrics.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14889-0
01:22:16.646 --> 01:22:17.636
And crossing matrix.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14895-0
01:22:19.146 --> 01:22:20.596
No, not because that.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14906-0
01:22:20.316 --> 01:22:20.646
So.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14899-0
01:22:20.606 --> 01:22:21.796
What is eigenspace?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14916-0
01:22:22.266 --> 01:22:25.306
They set of eigenvectors
corresponding to an eigenvalue.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14933-0
01:22:25.316 --> 01:22:29.429
Lambda spans a subspace of
orange called the eigenspace of

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14933-1
01:22:29.429 --> 01:22:30.196
this thing.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14961-0
01:22:30.206 --> 01:22:35.009
In this case, what will be there
each canonical vector that is

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14961-1
01:22:35.009 --> 01:22:37.296
1000 will also be one element.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14971-0
01:22:37.306 --> 01:22:40.356
01000 will also be an element
and so on.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14978-0
01:22:40.786 --> 01:22:41.806
So that is the reason.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14988-0
01:22:42.186 --> 01:22:43.976
Uh and the eigenspace?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/14993-0
01:22:44.736 --> 01:22:45.716
This is on it, OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15004-0
01:22:52.316 --> 01:22:54.306
What can you repeat that that
one?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15005-0
01:22:54.156 --> 01:22:54.316
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15012-0
01:22:57.296 --> 01:22:57.996
Should we work it out?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15015-0
01:22:59.916 --> 01:23:00.516
Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15028-0
01:23:07.736 --> 01:23:10.656
So let me take the identity
matrix 1001.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15033-0
01:23:11.636 --> 01:23:12.486
Now, what are the eigenvalues?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15047-0
01:23:16.696 --> 01:23:20.206
1 minus Lambda 001 minus Lambda.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15060-0
01:23:20.716 --> 01:23:24.136
This determinant will be equal
to 0, so Lambda minus one.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15055-0
01:23:21.466 --> 01:23:21.746
Listen.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15079-0
01:23:24.146 --> 01:23:28.084
The whole square in three equal
to zero, which implies Lambda

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15078-0
01:23:27.836 --> 01:23:28.056
1.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15079-1
01:23:28.084 --> 01:23:29.926
equal to 1 uh, one comma one.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15096-0
01:23:32.066 --> 01:23:35.225
I can even say Lambda one is 1,
Lambda 2 is also the same 1

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15096-1
01:23:35.225 --> 01:23:35.646
correct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15102-0
01:23:37.776 --> 01:23:37.886
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15104-0
01:23:37.776 --> 01:23:39.656
Now, what is?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15108-0
01:23:39.706 --> 01:23:42.186
Uh, tiger.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15116-0
01:23:42.196 --> 01:23:43.896
Vector corresponding Lambda
equal to 1.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15121-0
01:23:44.316 --> 01:23:45.066
So what will you do?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15142-0
01:23:46.966 --> 01:23:56.436
You will simply say 0000 off
X1X2 equal to 00, correct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15147-0
01:24:06.256 --> 01:24:06.626
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15148-0
01:24:06.996 --> 01:24:07.446
Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15160-0
01:24:10.386 --> 01:24:10.726
Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15154-0
01:24:10.856 --> 01:24:11.206
You do.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15164-0
01:24:11.336 --> 01:24:11.756
Get it?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15167-0
01:24:11.816 --> 01:24:13.416
A minus Lambda X, yes, yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15168-0
01:24:13.656 --> 01:24:14.356
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15180-0
01:24:14.636 --> 01:24:17.806
Now, why can't this X1X2 be?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15188-0
01:24:20.626 --> 01:24:21.306
Jerusalem.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15212-0
01:24:22.576 --> 01:24:27.096
You can take any nonzero stuff
and then it will span.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15263-0
01:24:23.576 --> 01:24:25.736
Any any and.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15201-0
01:24:24.606 --> 01:24:25.126
Anything.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15209-0
01:24:26.466 --> 01:24:26.906
Anything.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15217-0
01:24:26.916 --> 01:24:27.476
Anything, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15235-0
01:24:27.446 --> 01:24:32.771
Yeah, it will basically be, uh,
yeah, I I can, for example take

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15235-1
01:24:32.771 --> 01:24:33.686
10AS X 1X2.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15249-0
01:24:33.696 --> 01:24:35.986
I can take 01 as X1X2 and so on.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15262-0
01:24:36.406 --> 01:24:40.816
So the the the Eigenspace will
be the entire R2 right?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15278-0
01:24:43.196 --> 01:24:43.856
Yes, yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15279-0
01:24:44.336 --> 01:24:45.226
That's what I mean.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15287-0
01:24:44.646 --> 01:24:45.166
He should.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15290-0
01:24:45.596 --> 01:24:47.356
You do the same thing in and
dimensions.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15296-0
01:24:51.416 --> 01:24:51.866
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15300-0
01:24:51.876 --> 01:24:53.476
Agent values of.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15311-0
01:24:53.526 --> 01:24:56.916
A&amp;A transpose are same uh
why?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15337-0
01:24:56.926 --> 01:25:02.044
Because the eigen values of a
transpose are you by grading by

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15337-1
01:25:02.044 --> 01:25:06.666
solving a transpose minus Lambda
I equal to 0, correct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15342-0
01:25:12.616 --> 01:25:13.116
Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15368-0
01:25:13.926 --> 01:25:19.193
Now, now you know that this is
same as determinant of a minus

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15346-0
01:25:14.176 --> 01:25:14.336
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15354-0
01:25:15.606 --> 01:25:16.646
Yes, yes, VENKATA said.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15368-1
01:25:19.193 --> 01:25:22.676
Lambda I the whole transpose
equal to 0.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15386-0
01:25:24.546 --> 01:25:27.430
Now you know the determinant of
some transpose and determinant

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15386-1
01:25:27.430 --> 01:25:28.666
of the matrix are the same.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15399-0
01:25:32.276 --> 01:25:36.126
Which in place if if Lambda is
an eigenvalue.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15413-0
01:25:38.296 --> 01:25:43.356
Eigenvalue of A10 Lambda is an
eigenvalue of a transpose.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15422-0
01:25:46.516 --> 01:25:46.836
He's.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15424-0
01:25:46.726 --> 01:25:47.206
Extensor.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15425-0
01:25:48.196 --> 01:25:48.886
And the other way.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15430-0
01:25:52.236 --> 01:25:52.806
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15434-0
01:25:52.816 --> 01:25:53.796
And try A transpose.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15441-0
01:25:53.806 --> 01:25:56.606
Have the same eigenvalues, no?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15444-0
01:25:57.416 --> 01:25:57.626
That.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15476-0
01:26:03.636 --> 01:26:07.851
The eigenvectors X1X2 up to XN
of a N crossed matrix A with N

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15476-1
01:26:07.851 --> 01:26:11.046
distinct eigenvalues are
linearly independent.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15493-0
01:26:12.716 --> 01:26:16.826
Uh, will you give me 3 to 4
minutes to prove this?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15508-0
01:26:20.186 --> 01:26:20.646
Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15509-0
01:26:20.396 --> 01:26:20.836
He is.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15515-0
01:26:20.556 --> 01:26:22.216
Yes, when they said, please go
ahead.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15517-0
01:26:22.606 --> 01:26:24.486
You do you understand the the
statement.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15536-0
01:26:28.326 --> 01:26:28.726
Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15548-0
01:26:29.026 --> 01:26:31.266
Yeah, that they form a basis in
RN, right?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15542-0
01:26:29.356 --> 01:26:30.336
How should I dramatize it?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15541-0
01:26:30.176 --> 01:26:30.396
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15546-0
01:26:32.196 --> 01:26:32.606
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15552-0
01:26:32.616 --> 01:26:33.576
So should it dramatize it?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15577-0
01:26:34.326 --> 01:26:38.798
So yeah, A is a matrix where you
have eigenvalues Lambda 1,

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15577-1
01:26:38.798 --> 01:26:42.226
Lambda 2 up to Lambda N and all
of different.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15589-0
01:26:46.666 --> 01:26:48.456
So not to eigenvalues are the
same.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15620-0
01:26:48.466 --> 01:26:53.528
OK, now you try to find out when
I can victory X1 corresponding

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15620-1
01:26:53.528 --> 01:26:58.352
to Lambda 11X2 correspond Lambda
2 and 1X N corresponding to

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15620-2
01:26:58.352 --> 01:26:58.906
Lambda.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15650-0
01:27:01.516 --> 01:27:07.552
Now what the theorem says is
that all these X1 X 2X6 up to XN

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15650-1
01:27:07.552 --> 01:27:09.986
are linearly independent.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15656-0
01:27:12.326 --> 01:27:13.396
If these are all distinct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15658-0
01:27:20.526 --> 01:27:20.806
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15666-0
01:27:23.736 --> 01:27:24.576
So should I prove that?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15667-0
01:27:26.256 --> 01:27:26.536
This is.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15681-0
01:27:28.516 --> 01:27:31.586
Did that just a yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15688-0
01:27:31.666 --> 01:27:34.076
Have a screen right because it's
one.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15691-0
01:27:34.866 --> 01:27:35.636
It is a big.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15713-0
01:27:39.846 --> 01:27:43.519
Or gonna related to X #2 that
that's the reason they're

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15713-1
01:27:43.519 --> 01:27:44.896
linearly independent.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15715-0
01:27:45.676 --> 01:27:46.846
No, not really.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15720-0
01:27:48.456 --> 01:27:50.566
So I will say that.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15759-0
01:27:50.636 --> 01:28:00.947
That the let X1X2 all the way up
to uh XNB not linearly

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15759-1
01:28:00.947 --> 01:28:03.156
independent.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15782-0
01:28:05.136 --> 01:28:12.393
Specifically, I will say X1X2 up
to XRR only linearly

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15782-1
01:28:12.393 --> 01:28:14.006
independent.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15789-0
01:28:14.176 --> 01:28:15.846
That is, R is the maximum index.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15796-0
01:28:19.526 --> 01:28:21.106
Index up to which.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15812-0
01:28:23.776 --> 01:28:27.846
X1 up to XR linearly
independent.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15816-0
01:28:27.896 --> 01:28:28.996
You got, you got my point.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15826-0
01:28:31.076 --> 01:28:31.476
He is.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15840-0
01:28:32.696 --> 01:28:37.156
I'm not saying I'm saying let
all of them need not be linearly

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15840-1
01:28:37.156 --> 01:28:38.006
independent.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15860-0
01:28:39.766 --> 01:28:42.534
So you will say that after some
stage they will lose the linear

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15860-1
01:28:42.534 --> 01:28:43.486
independence, correct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15865-0
01:28:45.326 --> 01:28:45.786
He is.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15872-0
01:28:46.676 --> 01:28:46.956
Right.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15893-0
01:28:46.816 --> 01:28:50.962
Science calling that stages are,
so I will say X1X2 up to XR or

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15893-1
01:28:50.962 --> 01:28:52.646
only linearly independent.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15901-0
01:28:53.046 --> 01:28:57.156
This R is now less than OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15910-0
01:28:58.786 --> 01:28:59.426
Oh kismet.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15918-0
01:29:00.436 --> 01:29:03.206
So ax one up to XR and only
linearly independent.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15922-0
01:29:03.416 --> 01:29:04.306
Now what is the?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15952-0
01:29:06.156 --> 01:29:11.280
Consequence of that is, I will
say my XR plus one will XR plus

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15952-1
01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:15.346
one be linearly independent of
the one of the XR.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15957-0
01:29:17.456 --> 01:29:17.546
No.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15959-0
01:29:17.706 --> 01:29:17.906
No.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15971-0
01:29:18.816 --> 01:29:21.076
Because only X1 up to X or are
linearly independent.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/15984-0
01:29:21.086 --> 01:29:24.216
So if I add XR plus one to the
set, what will happen?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16016-0
01:29:24.996 --> 01:29:27.816
Linearly independent, not not
independent.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16012-0
01:29:25.586 --> 01:29:26.836
It would become dependent.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16007-0
01:29:26.556 --> 01:29:27.066
He didn't.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16051-0
01:29:27.076 --> 01:29:32.993
Dependent dependent so I can
write my XR plus one as A1 X one

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16025-0
01:29:28.326 --> 01:29:28.986
You can.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16030-0
01:29:29.806 --> 01:29:30.806
A linearly dependent, yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16051-1
01:29:32.993 --> 01:29:38.146
plus alpha 2X2 plus all the way
plus alpha R correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16055-0
01:29:39.856 --> 01:29:40.526
Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16122-0
01:29:40.906 --> 01:29:41.016
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16067-0
01:29:42.236 --> 01:29:46.656
OK, now I call it as equation
one.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16091-0
01:29:47.636 --> 01:29:51.968
Now I multiply both sides of
equation with within a, so I

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16091-1
01:29:51.968 --> 01:29:53.686
will get a XR plus one.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16118-0
01:29:53.696 --> 01:30:00.931
We will be equal to uh A1 a of
X1 plus A2 a of X2 plus all the

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16118-1
01:30:00.931 --> 01:30:04.836
way up to alpha A of exa.
Agreed.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16124-0
01:30:06.656 --> 01:30:06.896
Please.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16128-0
01:30:07.576 --> 01:30:07.736
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16144-0
01:30:08.586 --> 01:30:13.376
AX R + 1 is nothing but Lambda r
+ 1 X r + 1.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16154-0
01:30:13.386 --> 01:30:16.446
Why this is the eigenvalue,
eigenvector pair correct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16169-0
01:30:19.256 --> 01:30:21.576
Yes, thinking.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16166-0
01:30:20.086 --> 01:30:20.406
Agreed.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16191-0
01:30:21.016 --> 01:30:26.542
This would be equal to A1 Lambda
X1 plus A2 Lambda X2 plus all

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16191-1
01:30:26.542 --> 01:30:28.296
the way up to alpha.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16194-0
01:30:28.306 --> 01:30:30.006
Are Lambda XR correct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16202-0
01:30:31.566 --> 01:30:33.356
Because AX equal to Lambda X.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16205-0
01:30:34.736 --> 01:30:35.406
Yeah, sure.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16208-0
01:30:35.456 --> 01:30:35.756
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16222-0
01:30:37.246 --> 01:30:38.976
OK, so you understood this part
correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16234-0
01:30:38.196 --> 01:30:41.976
But slightly different Lambda 1,
Lambda 2 Lambda.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16230-0
01:30:42.436 --> 01:30:42.626
Uh.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16232-0
01:30:42.636 --> 01:30:43.026
Correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16246-0
01:30:43.116 --> 01:30:49.196
OK, Lambda I forgot Lambda 1,
Lambda 2, Lambda agree.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16271-0
01:30:50.486 --> 01:30:55.390
Now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to multiply this equation

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16271-1
01:30:55.390 --> 01:30:57.076
one with Lambda r + 1.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16322-0
01:30:57.626 --> 01:31:04.825
If I do that, will I not get
Lambda R + 1 X r + 1 will be

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16322-1
01:31:04.825 --> 01:31:12.397
equal to A1 Lambda R + 1 X one
plus A2 Lambda r + 1 X 2 plus

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16322-2
01:31:12.397 --> 01:31:17.486
all the way up to alpha Lambda R
+ 1 XR.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16324-0
01:31:21.146 --> 01:31:21.276
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16348-0
01:31:23.406 --> 01:31:27.803
If I subtract these two, I will
call this as two and this as

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16348-1
01:31:27.803 --> 01:31:28.236
three.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16361-0
01:31:28.826 --> 01:31:32.006
If I subtract 2 -, 3, will I get
a 0 on the left side?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16369-0
01:31:36.076 --> 01:31:36.826
He isn't.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16372-0
01:31:36.876 --> 01:31:37.236
Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16407-0
01:31:38.106 --> 01:31:46.003
Plus you get an A1 times Lambda
1 minus Lambda R + 1 X one plus

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16407-1
01:31:46.003 --> 01:31:54.146
all the way up to alpha R Lambda
R minus Lambda r + 1 XR correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16409-0
01:31:57.306 --> 01:31:57.586
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16412-0
01:31:59.326 --> 01:31:59.846
Are they?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16420-0
01:32:02.776 --> 01:32:02.956
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16424-0
01:32:03.716 --> 01:32:04.226
Issue.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16438-0
01:32:04.176 --> 01:32:10.356
Now the question is X1 to XR odd
linearly independent?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16450-0
01:32:10.856 --> 01:32:14.976
I am having a linear combination
of them equal to 0.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16455-0
01:32:14.986 --> 01:32:15.846
So what does it imply?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16461-0
01:32:19.926 --> 01:32:20.376
Yearly.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16467-0
01:32:20.406 --> 01:32:20.996
Really different.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16472-0
01:32:22.066 --> 01:32:22.676
Which did not.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16470-0
01:32:22.196 --> 01:32:22.376
What?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16487-0
01:32:25.916 --> 01:32:27.336
Which means they are linearly
dependent.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16488-0
01:32:28.356 --> 01:32:28.936
No, Bubba.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16503-0
01:32:31.016 --> 01:32:34.186
I am saying X1 to XR are
linearly independent.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16520-0
01:32:35.136 --> 01:32:38.467
So if I take any linear
combination and put it equal to

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16520-1
01:32:38.467 --> 01:32:39.776
0, what does it imply?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16531-0
01:32:41.336 --> 01:32:42.556
On the go.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16534-0
01:32:41.466 --> 01:32:44.336
Ohh for the first yeah yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16532-0
01:32:43.096 --> 01:32:43.986
They are dependent.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16551-0
01:32:45.836 --> 01:32:48.166
Lambda one is equal to Lambda R
+ 1.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16563-0
01:32:46.096 --> 01:32:52.206
How I am saying I am saying X1
to X are linearly independent.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16578-0
01:32:52.256 --> 01:32:55.911
So I take a linear combination
of these vectors, put it equal

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16578-1
01:32:55.911 --> 01:32:56.206
to 0.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16589-0
01:32:56.446 --> 01:32:57.926
So what is a consequence of
that?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16612-0
01:32:59.106 --> 01:33:00.306
The coefficients will be 0.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16617-0
01:32:59.606 --> 01:33:01.456
The scalars are all good.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16622-0
01:33:00.786 --> 01:33:02.026
And then getting pregnant.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16658-0
01:33:00.856 --> 01:33:06.013
Take all the coefficients should
be 0, so I will have A1 times

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16627-0
01:33:03.596 --> 01:33:03.926
Correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16658-1
01:33:06.013 --> 01:33:10.680
Lambda 1 minus Lambda r + 1
equal to 0 all the way up to

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16648-0
01:33:09.896 --> 01:33:10.156
Right.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16658-2
01:33:10.680 --> 01:33:15.346
alpha are Lambda minus Lambda r
+ 1 equal to 0, correct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16663-0
01:33:17.136 --> 01:33:17.466
Umm.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16666-0
01:33:18.076 --> 01:33:18.236
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16675-0
01:33:19.136 --> 01:33:22.136
But can't Lambda 1 minus Lambda
r + 1 be equal to 0?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16678-0
01:33:24.006 --> 01:33:24.186
No.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16681-0
01:33:24.986 --> 01:33:25.226
Right.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16688-0
01:33:27.126 --> 01:33:27.986
They're distinguish.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16703-0
01:33:27.996 --> 01:33:28.856
Assume they are distinct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16698-0
01:33:28.436 --> 01:33:29.166
Very good.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16710-0
01:33:29.376 --> 01:33:31.826
They are distinct, so this can
never be equal to 0.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16719-0
01:33:31.836 --> 01:33:32.966
So what will that be?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16735-0
01:33:33.136 --> 01:33:34.356
A1 should be equal to 0.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16733-0
01:33:33.556 --> 01:33:34.686
A1 is 0.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16754-0
01:33:35.446 --> 01:33:41.366
Does A1 equal to A2 equal to
alpha ARB equal to 0 correct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16760-0
01:33:41.726 --> 01:33:42.446
That's right.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16777-0
01:33:43.256 --> 01:33:47.264
Now if A1 up to alpha r = 0,
what will be your XR, XR plus

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16777-1
01:33:47.264 --> 01:33:47.536
one?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16780-0
01:33:51.516 --> 01:33:51.806
0.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16797-0
01:33:52.696 --> 01:33:58.006
Ah, this will yield this in
place XR plus one equal to 0A.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16797-1
01:33:58.006 --> 01:33:59.266
Contradiction.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16798-0
01:34:00.386 --> 01:34:00.676
Right.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16810-0
01:34:02.376 --> 01:34:05.496
As XR Plus one is an
eigenvector.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16830-0
01:34:09.186 --> 01:34:15.712
And hence nonzero, therefore X1
up to XN are linearly

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16830-1
01:34:15.712 --> 01:34:17.646
independent. OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16831-0
01:34:18.916 --> 01:34:19.096
Umm.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16840-0
01:34:22.656 --> 01:34:22.936
Agree.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16859-0
01:34:23.366 --> 01:34:27.522
The third can you please Scroll
down a bit here, here, here the

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16859-1
01:34:27.522 --> 01:34:29.276
second and third equations?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16863-0
01:34:29.786 --> 01:34:31.296
Can you just come again?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16866-0
01:34:29.856 --> 01:34:30.016
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16873-0
01:34:31.306 --> 01:34:32.186
How are we getting it?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16896-0
01:34:32.646 --> 01:34:41.559
One is you multiply 1 bit it in
the third one you multiply 1

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16896-1
01:34:41.559 --> 01:34:45.066
with Lambda r + 1 it is.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16928-0
01:34:52.096 --> 01:34:56.804
Set in this we have assumed they
are distinct, so the theorem

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16928-1
01:34:56.804 --> 01:35:01.056
will go for a distinct values
only, or all the vectors.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16989-0
01:35:03.246 --> 01:35:11.664
It's not very clear what I'm
saying is if you have a matrix

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16989-1
01:35:11.664 --> 01:35:19.801
here and you get eigenvalues
11.22641 -, 2.8, then you'll

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/16989-2
01:35:19.801 --> 01:35:26.536
find 4 icon vectors X1, X, 2X3
and X4. Correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17001-0
01:35:28.646 --> 01:35:28.896
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17010-0
01:35:29.836 --> 01:35:32.826
Now the theorem very clearly
says are they distinct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17017-0
01:35:32.926 --> 01:35:33.796
They are distinct, right?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17029-0
01:35:35.216 --> 01:35:35.816
Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17033-0
01:35:35.486 --> 01:35:38.476
Therefore, X1X2 up to X4 are
linearly.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17035-0
01:35:40.946 --> 01:35:41.306
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17038-0
01:35:43.846 --> 01:35:44.126
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17040-0
01:35:46.136 --> 01:35:46.346
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17052-0
01:35:49.676 --> 01:35:51.666
But this is also only one way
true.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17071-0
01:35:53.786 --> 01:35:58.333
This doesn't mean that if some
of them are equal, that it

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17071-1
01:35:58.333 --> 01:36:00.606
cannot be thinly independent.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17075-0
01:36:00.616 --> 01:36:01.226
It doesn't say that.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17078-0
01:36:04.436 --> 01:36:04.766
Pardon.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17099-0
01:36:06.986 --> 01:36:11.465
If they are distinct then then I
eigenvectors are linearly

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17099-1
01:36:11.465 --> 01:36:12.376
independent.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17103-0
01:36:12.446 --> 01:36:13.356
That is the theorem.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17118-0
01:36:13.886 --> 01:36:17.202
The theorem doesn't say if they
are not distinct, then they

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17118-1
01:36:17.202 --> 01:36:18.916
cannot be linearly independent.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17127-0
01:36:18.926 --> 01:36:20.706
That does the dealer doesn't say
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17141-0
01:36:27.376 --> 01:36:29.246
This is something I have already
shown here.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17155-0
01:36:29.256 --> 01:36:33.316
Transpose A is symmetric matrix
and positive definite, full

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17155-1
01:36:33.316 --> 01:36:35.076
column rank etcetera. Now.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17167-0
01:36:35.946 --> 01:36:39.036
That quick, this is called the
spectral theorem.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17187-0
01:36:39.306 --> 01:36:41.752
We will not attempt the proof of
the spectral theorem, but I'll

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17187-1
01:36:41.752 --> 01:36:42.516
tell you what it is.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17222-0
01:36:42.926 --> 01:36:47.725
If A is a symmetric matrix,
there exists an orthonormal

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17222-1
01:36:47.725 --> 01:36:52.868
basis of OK of the corresponding
vector space consisting of

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17222-2
01:36:52.868 --> 01:36:56.896
eigenvectors of A and each
eigenvalue is real.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17250-0
01:36:57.276 --> 01:37:02.179
So I am going to tell you saying
that if you have by chance A is

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17250-1
01:37:02.179 --> 01:37:05.876
a symmetric matrix, each
eigenvalue is real and.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17276-0
01:37:10.236 --> 01:37:13.055
And there will exist an
orthonormal basis of

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17276-1
01:37:13.055 --> 01:37:16.938
corresponding vector space be
considering of the eigenvectors

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17276-2
01:37:16.938 --> 01:37:17.126
of.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17296-0
01:37:17.336 --> 01:37:22.856
So the eigenvectors of a will be
will be, yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17321-0
01:37:23.256 --> 01:37:32.026
The basis for RN, now it has
several parts, so yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17313-0
01:37:30.736 --> 01:37:32.046
So, so, so sorry.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17330-0
01:37:32.196 --> 01:37:34.526
Uh, can you please break down
that statement again?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17340-0
01:37:35.056 --> 01:37:35.776
The the theorem.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17334-0
01:37:35.356 --> 01:37:35.646
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17341-0
01:37:35.696 --> 01:37:37.246
Let me then let me write down.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17347-0
01:37:39.696 --> 01:37:40.736
This is spectral there.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17361-0
01:37:44.366 --> 01:37:48.936
So A is a symmetric matrix
matrix.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17358-0
01:37:47.256 --> 01:37:49.056
Symmetric. Umm.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17379-0
01:37:49.866 --> 01:37:57.266
So 1 consequence of its eigen
values are real, now B.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17377-0
01:37:53.576 --> 01:37:54.486
Well, is the real.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17385-0
01:37:58.746 --> 01:37:59.776
The icon vectors.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17387-0
01:38:03.306 --> 01:38:04.236
And.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17402-0
01:38:06.366 --> 01:38:14.436
Uh auto, normal and a a phone.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17407-0
01:38:15.706 --> 01:38:18.266
A basis of our.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17411-0
01:38:24.756 --> 01:38:24.976
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17412-0
01:38:26.346 --> 01:38:26.896
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17414-0
01:38:26.966 --> 01:38:27.076
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17420-0
01:38:27.966 --> 01:38:28.376
Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17442-0
01:38:28.236 --> 01:38:32.843
Now, before I prove that there
are two simple results, so I

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17431-0
01:38:28.426 --> 01:38:28.906
Makes sense.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17442-1
01:38:32.843 --> 01:38:35.146
will, I will show them to you.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17444-0
01:38:35.496 --> 01:38:35.956
One is.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17474-0
01:38:38.446 --> 01:38:43.025
If you have an eigenvalue Lambda
and then again vector X

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17474-1
01:38:43.025 --> 01:38:47.604
corresponding to Lambda, you
have a X equal to Lambda X,

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17474-2
01:38:47.604 --> 01:38:48.086
right?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17478-0
01:38:50.386 --> 01:38:50.646
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17490-0
01:38:51.766 --> 01:38:55.416
Now you instead of saying exists
and I again vector.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17548-0
01:38:55.426 --> 01:39:00.149
You can also say some MU times X
is also an eigenvector

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17548-1
01:39:00.149 --> 01:39:05.546
corresponding to this Lambda by
because I times M UX is nothing

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17514-0
01:39:02.506 --> 01:39:02.816
Correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17548-2
01:39:05.546 --> 01:39:11.112
but M U * X which is nothing but
MU times Lambda X right which is

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17548-3
01:39:11.112 --> 01:39:13.726
nothing but Lambda times new X.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17562-0
01:39:13.936 --> 01:39:16.306
So you see a UX equal to Lambda
MU X.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17569-0
01:39:16.346 --> 01:39:18.206
So MUX is also an eigenvector,
correct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17570-0
01:39:19.496 --> 01:39:19.676
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17585-0
01:39:21.946 --> 01:39:24.776
OK, now OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17584-0
01:39:22.576 --> 01:39:23.816
Thermo is a scalar.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17617-0
01:39:24.826 --> 01:39:29.081
Now suppose there is an
eigenvalue Lambda and there is

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17617-1
01:39:29.081 --> 01:39:33.800
an eigenvector X and for the
same eigenvalue Lambda there is

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17617-2
01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:36.276
another eigenvector called. Why?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17639-0
01:39:41.946 --> 01:39:48.216
Now you have a X equal to Lambda
X&amp;AY equal to Lambda Y.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17627-0
01:39:42.346 --> 01:39:42.586
But.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17656-0
01:39:49.076 --> 01:39:55.616
This will imply that a of X + y
equal to Lambda of X + y.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17669-0
01:39:56.756 --> 01:39:59.186
It says that you want X + y is
an eigenvector.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17674-0
01:40:05.406 --> 01:40:07.546
Corresponding to laptop OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17709-0
01:40:13.966 --> 01:40:19.359
So, but I guess we had mentioned
that for an eigenvalue there

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17709-1
01:40:19.359 --> 01:40:23.796
will be corresponding only one
eigenvector, right?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17703-0
01:40:22.676 --> 01:40:23.766
No, I said.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17713-0
01:40:24.076 --> 01:40:26.636
I never said only one, I said
one.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17719-0
01:40:29.316 --> 01:40:29.666
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17743-0
01:40:30.676 --> 01:40:36.485
And if you're asking for the
example as to for a given, uh,

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17743-1
01:40:36.485 --> 01:40:39.486
igen value, how can there be 2?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17747-0
01:40:39.576 --> 01:40:40.226
Maybe not.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17767-0
01:40:40.236 --> 01:40:44.042
They are going to give you an
example where you have for the

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17767-1
01:40:44.042 --> 01:40:45.976
same eigenvalue 2 eigenvectors.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17775-0
01:40:47.186 --> 01:40:49.626
OK, OK that is possible.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17776-0
01:40:50.146 --> 01:40:50.866
That is possible.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17789-0
01:40:52.856 --> 01:40:56.886
OK, now this is all complex
Hermitian.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17805-0
01:40:56.896 --> 01:41:02.032
I have told you and in the
spectral theorem I want to take

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17805-1
01:41:02.032 --> 01:41:02.206
a.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17821-0
01:41:02.476 --> 01:41:06.415
This is basically basically this
hex H is nothing but you take

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17821-1
01:41:06.415 --> 01:41:08.166
the conjugate and transpose.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17839-0
01:41:08.176 --> 01:41:14.934
That is basically XH, so Exa
HAXM will be nothing but Lambda

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17839-1
01:41:14.934 --> 01:41:15.266
**.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17861-0
01:41:15.336 --> 01:41:18.496
I mean, this is the consequence
of multiplying AX equal to

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17861-1
01:41:18.496 --> 01:41:20.156
Lambda X with XH on both sides.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17877-0
01:41:21.686 --> 01:41:24.146
You can again take a hedge and
yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17871-0
01:41:22.846 --> 01:41:23.176
Hey guys.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17883-0
01:41:23.186 --> 01:41:26.376
Look sensum that it's ANTO.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17888-0
01:41:26.386 --> 01:41:29.876
Fast altara Yoda, Energine
Carlo.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17905-0
01:41:32.146 --> 01:41:34.296
Size server.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17892-0

Excellent.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17911-0
01:41:32.596 --> 01:41:36.056
The class router and the
Japanese.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17904-0
01:41:32.706 --> 01:41:32.976
You.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17910-0
01:41:34.426 --> 01:41:35.446
Can you please go on mute?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17923-0
01:41:38.716 --> 01:41:41.856
Size Saravan Lanka, can you
please go on mute please?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17935-0
01:41:45.586 --> 01:41:47.876
OK, now should we end?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17929-0
01:41:45.806 --> 01:41:46.196
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17939-0
01:41:46.206 --> 01:41:46.866
Sorry, continue.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17959-0
01:41:47.946 --> 01:41:52.275
Should I tell you a very simple
matter for this spectral theorem

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17959-1
01:41:52.275 --> 01:41:54.006
that that things are real?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17960-0
01:41:55.296 --> 01:41:55.766
Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17974-0
01:41:55.836 --> 01:42:01.066
So but one more thing, how can
we do Hermitian for an X?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17982-0
01:42:03.226 --> 01:42:07.416
Uh X candy complex?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/17979-0
01:42:03.386 --> 01:42:03.666
Right.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18009-0
01:42:11.656 --> 01:42:18.896
Workplace I 3 -, 3, so X
conjugate is nothing but 4 -.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18132-0
01:42:12.646 --> 01:42:12.806
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18008-0
01:42:17.756 --> 01:42:17.886
No.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18038-0
01:42:18.906 --> 01:42:24.820
I3 plus I eggs conjugate
transpose is nothing but 4 -, 8,

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18017-0
01:42:20.996 --> 01:42:21.306
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18021-0
01:42:21.316 --> 01:42:21.866
OK, OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18024-0
01:42:21.876 --> 01:42:22.106
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18030-0
01:42:22.116 --> 01:42:22.546
Yeah, sorry.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18038-1
01:42:24.820 --> 01:42:26.146
three, right.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18040-0
01:42:29.416 --> 01:42:29.636
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18054-0
01:42:31.886 --> 01:42:32.486
Yes, Sir. Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18059-0
01:42:32.776 --> 01:42:36.026
But with this I I would leave
you no more trouble.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18069-0
01:42:36.096 --> 01:42:38.106
So but cooperate with me for 2-3
minutes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18087-0
01:42:38.116 --> 01:42:46.436
It's enough now given given any
X uh, be real or complex.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18076-0
01:42:39.556 --> 01:42:39.856
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18093-0
01:42:49.036 --> 01:42:49.656
They do.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18103-0
01:42:49.666 --> 01:42:56.036
You find X uh, but transpose X
to be real.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18142-0
01:43:04.746 --> 01:43:10.442
So if you consider an X which is
nothing but yeah, one plus I

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18142-1
01:43:10.442 --> 01:43:16.415
B1A2 plus I B2 all the way up to
AN plus Ibn this is a gentle X,

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18142-2
01:43:16.415 --> 01:43:16.966
right?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18149-0
01:43:18.496 --> 01:43:18.676
Mm-hmm.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18160-0
01:43:19.596 --> 01:43:25.756
Now what is X bar transpose P
equal to a?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18153-0
01:43:20.056 --> 01:43:20.476
He is.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18167-0
01:43:25.766 --> 01:43:26.626
1 -.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18183-0
01:43:26.636 --> 01:43:32.506
I V1A21 plus I B2 all the way up
to AN minus Ibn correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18197-0
01:43:35.056 --> 01:43:37.226
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18193-0
01:43:35.316 --> 01:43:35.646
Correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18194-0
01:43:35.546 --> 01:43:35.716
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18208-0
01:43:36.766 --> 01:43:39.546
Therefore, what is X bar
transpose X?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18203-0
01:43:37.236 --> 01:43:37.766
It will be real.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18205-0
01:43:38.536 --> 01:43:38.796
Right.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18222-0
01:43:40.766 --> 01:43:41.836
This is nothing but yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18224-0
01:43:40.856 --> 01:43:43.946
So one, so one thing I need to
ask.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18231-0
01:43:43.956 --> 01:43:45.886
Uh, like the X bar?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18265-0
01:43:46.276 --> 01:43:50.553
Suppose in the left hand side
equation, if it is a 1 -, I V 1,

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18265-1
01:43:50.553 --> 01:43:52.386
then it will be A1 plus IB.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18293-0
01:43:51.556 --> 01:43:54.842
Yeah, 1 + I BY just change
whenever you put a bar, you

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18293-1
01:43:54.842 --> 01:43:58.426
change the sign between the real
part and the complex part.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18291-0
01:43:55.436 --> 01:43:59.646
I think the frank, OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18294-0
01:43:59.996 --> 01:44:00.256
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18297-0
01:44:00.266 --> 01:44:00.456
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18309-0
01:44:01.056 --> 01:44:03.296
OK, fine. Umm.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18305-0
01:44:01.146 --> 01:44:02.266
That's what I did here now.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18319-0
01:44:04.486 --> 01:44:06.516
This 3 -, 8 became 3 + 8.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18328-0
01:44:06.926 --> 01:44:08.916
This four plus I became 4 -, 8.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18330-0
01:44:09.316 --> 01:44:09.686
We're gonna.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18332-0
01:44:09.816 --> 01:44:10.296
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18355-0
01:44:10.756 --> 01:44:14.236
So just changing the like
something cycle.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18351-0
01:44:12.576 --> 01:44:15.126
Same between the real part and
the complex part.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18378-0
01:44:15.136 --> 01:44:19.234
OK, so X bar transpose X is
basically you will go, you're

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18378-1
01:44:19.234 --> 01:44:22.626
going to multiply this number
with this number.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18398-0
01:44:23.096 --> 01:44:27.067
Now if you multiply A1 minus IB
one with A1 plus IB one, what do

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18398-1
01:44:27.067 --> 01:44:27.556
you get?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18413-0
01:44:29.796 --> 01:44:32.876
I'm going to get A 1 ^2 + B one
square agree.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18423-0
01:44:33.706 --> 01:44:33.966
Correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18428-0
01:44:34.966 --> 01:44:36.426
Because I squared is minus one.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18425-0
01:44:35.156 --> 01:44:35.296
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18427-0
01:44:35.516 --> 01:44:35.976
Makes sense?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18432-0
01:44:37.226 --> 01:44:37.356
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18436-0
01:44:38.486 --> 01:44:39.436
So this is real.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18453-0
01:44:41.066 --> 01:44:42.866
Correct. Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18440-0
01:44:41.576 --> 01:44:41.946
Right.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18465-0
01:44:42.336 --> 01:44:45.063
And this father, second time,
I'm going to get a 2 square plus

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18465-1
01:44:45.063 --> 01:44:45.496
B2 square.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18479-0
01:44:46.486 --> 01:44:47.886
Yeah, all are real. Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18472-0
01:44:46.736 --> 01:44:48.676
Yeah, all of you.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18487-0
01:44:48.736 --> 01:44:51.026
Let's A N ^2 + b N square.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18489-0
01:44:48.986 --> 01:44:49.676
All are real.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18508-0
01:44:51.276 --> 01:44:54.322
This is real, so this X bar
transpose X is really your

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18508-1
01:44:54.322 --> 01:44:54.876
convinced.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18511-0
01:44:55.776 --> 01:44:55.926
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18516-0
01:44:56.066 --> 01:44:57.386
And it's pushed you also, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18529-0
01:44:58.376 --> 01:45:00.296
Yeah, that is that is
universally known.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18528-0
01:44:59.466 --> 01:44:59.806
No, no.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18534-0
01:45:00.306 --> 01:45:02.316
Now X transpose X is always
positive.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18545-0
01:45:05.816 --> 01:45:06.346
That is OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18581-0
01:45:06.356 --> 01:45:11.290
That is not a problem at all, as
whenever X is not equal to zero,

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18553-0
01:45:06.386 --> 01:45:07.206
Yes, yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18581-1
01:45:11.290 --> 01:45:15.925
** bar transpose X or in the
real case it is X transpose X is

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18581-2
01:45:15.925 --> 01:45:17.346
more than zero. OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18592-0
01:45:21.786 --> 01:45:25.576
Now you have a X equal to Lambda
X agree.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18605-0
01:45:28.516 --> 01:45:33.566
Now I am telling you ZADE
symmetric or it is Hermitian.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18607-0
01:45:35.696 --> 01:45:35.856
Now.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18619-0
01:45:38.246 --> 01:45:39.766
What is it that we have to
prove?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18623-0
01:45:39.836 --> 01:45:41.206
We need to prove to prove.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18630-0
01:45:42.886 --> 01:45:45.806
Lambda is real. Agree.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18631-0
01:45:46.936 --> 01:45:47.056
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18636-0
01:45:49.636 --> 01:45:50.106
Got it.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18640-0
01:45:51.466 --> 01:45:51.856
Could it?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18645-0
01:45:52.406 --> 01:45:52.866
Got it.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18654-0
01:45:53.796 --> 01:45:57.046
So what is the way to do it is I
can do?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18677-0
01:45:58.966 --> 01:46:05.009
I get multiply this bit X bar,
transpose a X which is equal to

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18677-1
01:46:05.009 --> 01:46:08.846
X bar, transpose Lambda X you'll
agree.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18682-0
01:46:11.696 --> 01:46:11.906
Mm-hmm.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18686-0
01:46:12.816 --> 01:46:13.116
Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18695-0
01:46:13.136 --> 01:46:18.076
Now now this is equal to Lambda
X bar transpose X.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18702-0
01:46:20.696 --> 01:46:21.016
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18699-0
01:46:22.226 --> 01:46:22.476
Why?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18711-0
01:46:22.486 --> 01:46:24.866
Because I can remove this scalar
Lambda outside.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18716-0
01:46:24.876 --> 01:46:26.246
Why multiplication of vectors?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18727-0
01:46:29.876 --> 01:46:30.276
Got it.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18729-0
01:46:29.966 --> 01:46:30.486
Yes. No.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18731-0
01:46:31.436 --> 01:46:31.906
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18736-0
01:46:31.826 --> 01:46:32.166
Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18753-0
01:46:32.036 --> 01:46:38.130
Therefore, therefore, what is my
Lambda is nothing but X bar

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18753-1
01:46:38.130 --> 01:46:42.326
transpose, a XYX bar transpose X
correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18755-0
01:46:43.166 --> 01:46:43.466
Correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18765-0
01:46:44.786 --> 01:46:48.406
Now, somehow you know that this
is real, right?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18774-0
01:46:50.886 --> 01:46:52.936
Yeah, expert transfers exist.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18790-0
01:46:52.476 --> 01:46:56.596
Xbox transpose X is real, so I
need to prove so to prove.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18789-0
01:46:52.946 --> 01:46:54.796
Really is, yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18794-0
01:46:58.676 --> 01:47:00.086
Lambda is real.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18799-0
01:47:01.686 --> 01:47:03.006
We need to prove.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18808-0
01:47:05.436 --> 01:47:07.356
X bar transpose ax is real,
right?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18816-0
01:47:08.236 --> 01:47:08.556
Correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18819-0
01:47:09.576 --> 01:47:11.696
He's real whenever.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18828-0
01:47:13.406 --> 01:47:16.476
Yeah, you see, but it, buddy.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18836-0
01:47:17.816 --> 01:47:18.136
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18849-0
01:47:19.886 --> 01:47:24.323
OK, so I will consider this
number as MU which is nothing

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18849-1
01:47:24.323 --> 01:47:26.006
but X bar transpose X.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18862-0
01:47:28.886 --> 01:47:33.926
Now, are you convinced that this
new UI is a number?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18878-0
01:47:36.806 --> 01:47:38.446
Yes, it it's a Scala.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18889-0
01:47:38.996 --> 01:47:42.790
It is a scalar, but you may
claim that it could be complex

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18889-1
01:47:42.790 --> 01:47:43.626
also correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18899-0
01:47:45.506 --> 01:47:46.296
Yeah, it can be.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18903-0
01:47:47.266 --> 01:47:48.976
It can be complex also.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18908-0
01:47:49.386 --> 01:47:50.916
So what I do is.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18919-0
01:47:54.106 --> 01:47:58.566
I transpose this character.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18928-0
01:48:00.346 --> 01:48:03.236
If I transpose a scalar, what is
it going to be?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18940-0
01:48:09.136 --> 01:48:09.756
Same number.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18975-0
01:48:09.816 --> 01:48:09.956
Well.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19001-0
01:48:09.836 --> 01:48:10.066
We.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18961-0
01:48:10.726 --> 01:48:12.666
Then there is no effect on that,
right?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18969-0
01:48:14.146 --> 01:48:17.586
You transpose is equal to X bar
A transpose X transpose.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18984-0
01:48:19.556 --> 01:48:20.646
No, I will write it.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18996-0
01:48:20.666 --> 01:48:21.576
No, no, it's a scalar.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/18999-0
01:48:20.836 --> 01:48:23.746
You agree that new transpose is
said same as new, right?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19013-0
01:48:24.056 --> 01:48:26.406
Because it's a scalar now.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19010-0
01:48:24.506 --> 01:48:25.046
He is here.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19023-0
01:48:26.416 --> 01:48:29.981
This is nothing but X bar
transpose a X the whole

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19023-1
01:48:29.981 --> 01:48:31.336
transpose, correct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19033-0
01:48:34.606 --> 01:48:34.976
But it's.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19037-0
01:48:35.336 --> 01:48:35.556
Yep.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19047-0
01:48:36.236 --> 01:48:39.846
If I do now it's it acts in the
other direction, correct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19070-0
01:48:39.856 --> 01:48:44.792
Whenever I take the transpose,
this is nothing but X transpose

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19070-1
01:48:44.792 --> 01:48:49.336
A transpose X bar, transpose the
whole transpose correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19084-0
01:48:51.376 --> 01:48:52.076
But it took.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19092-0
01:48:53.246 --> 01:48:57.376
Which is nothing but X transpose
A transpose X bar correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19100-0
01:49:02.516 --> 01:49:02.786
Right.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19107-0
01:49:03.976 --> 01:49:04.356
Yes, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19114-0
01:49:04.076 --> 01:49:10.536
This I can write it as ** bar, a
bar. Uh.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19110-0
01:49:05.096 --> 01:49:06.016
Yes, yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19130-0
01:49:12.096 --> 01:49:18.187
Exit X bar, transpose a bar,
transpose the whole transpose,

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19130-1
01:49:18.187 --> 01:49:20.116
hold back, correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19132-0
01:49:23.006 --> 01:49:23.296
Correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19141-0
01:49:28.436 --> 01:49:28.906
Agreed.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19147-0
01:49:29.826 --> 01:49:30.326
Agreed here.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19150-0
01:49:30.506 --> 01:49:30.626
Yes.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19154-0
01:49:31.096 --> 01:49:31.316
Well.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19157-0
01:49:31.096 --> 01:49:33.606
Now, what is you tell me this
quantity.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19165-0
01:49:33.616 --> 01:49:36.656
What is this quantity when days
Hermitian?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19178-0
01:49:44.456 --> 01:49:45.966
Pennies have musician.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19187-0
01:49:46.336 --> 01:49:49.206
If you take a yeah, this is it.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19184-0
01:49:46.616 --> 01:49:47.116
You only.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19192-0
01:49:49.316 --> 01:49:49.826
Very good.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19208-0
01:49:49.956 --> 01:49:55.346
So this is nothing but X bar
transpose a X the whole bar.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19217-0
01:49:55.676 --> 01:49:58.346
But what is X bar transport
eggs?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19221-0
01:50:02.776 --> 01:50:03.256
Menu.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19222-0
01:50:03.776 --> 01:50:04.196
MU.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19227-0
01:50:06.806 --> 01:50:07.356
You what?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19245-0
01:50:07.666 --> 01:50:11.195
Now you have you started with
the new and you got it is equal

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19245-1
01:50:11.195 --> 01:50:12.276
to MU bar, correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19260-0
01:50:15.586 --> 01:50:20.096
Let you'll be equal to M U-1
plus I M U2.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19271-0
01:50:20.996 --> 01:50:22.706
Now, what is new equal to MU
bar?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19286-0
01:50:22.716 --> 01:50:28.806
Say you one plus I M U2 is equal
to MU 1 -.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19289-0
01:50:28.816 --> 01:50:29.816
I U to correct.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19297-0
01:50:31.476 --> 01:50:32.006
He or she.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19305-0
01:50:33.206 --> 01:50:35.556
So this new one new one get
cancelled.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19330-0
01:50:35.606 --> 01:50:40.373
So you will get two I M U2 equal
to zero which will imply MU 2

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19330-1
01:50:40.373 --> 01:50:41.886
equal to 0, correct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19328-0
01:50:41.006 --> 01:50:41.366
Ah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19333-0
01:50:43.396 --> 01:50:43.976
High school.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19344-0
01:50:44.046 --> 01:50:46.216
You. Ohh yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19358-0
01:50:46.306 --> 01:50:47.006
Musical you.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19356-0
01:50:46.636 --> 01:50:48.326
So what is new 2 equal to zero?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19361-0
01:50:48.336 --> 01:50:49.286
You play what is new.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19377-0
01:50:51.456 --> 01:50:52.126
It's real.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19379-0
01:50:51.676 --> 01:50:52.506
Image. Nothing.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19386-0
01:50:52.136 --> 01:50:53.576
It means MU is real, Sir.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19385-0
01:50:52.516 --> 01:50:53.586
I'm imaginary part.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19387-0
01:50:54.936 --> 01:50:55.086
You.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19402-0
01:50:57.956 --> 01:51:00.606
Imaginary part is 0, it means MU
is real.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19398-0
01:50:58.056 --> 01:50:58.196
Yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19416-0
01:51:03.056 --> 01:51:06.926
OK, now having come this far,
there is something called.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19419-0
01:51:06.936 --> 01:51:07.736
This is a corollary.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19430-0
01:51:09.536 --> 01:51:13.186
Yeah, it's called skull.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19434-0
01:51:13.186 --> 01:51:13.966
Head, Michigan.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19444-0
01:51:17.566 --> 01:51:21.196
If yeah, but transpose equal to
negative.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19446-0
01:51:21.206 --> 01:51:22.026
Yeah, OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19456-0
01:51:31.626 --> 01:51:33.026
Yeah, it's called skew
symmetric.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19455-0
01:51:32.386 --> 01:51:32.756
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19501-0
01:51:35.166 --> 01:51:39.254
If yeah, transpose equal to
negative a, but if you if there

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19487-0
01:51:36.156 --> 01:51:38.656
He transpose is equals to minus
there, yeah.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19501-1
01:51:39.254 --> 01:51:42.456
is a complex part, I call it a
skew Hermitian.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19520-0
01:51:42.786 --> 01:51:46.258
In that case I will get
everything saying that new equal

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19508-0
01:51:43.336 --> 01:51:43.676
OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19520-1
01:51:46.258 --> 01:51:47.416
to negative MU bar.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19540-0
01:51:47.866 --> 01:51:51.123
You do the same derivation, but
wherever this is there, this

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19540-1
01:51:51.123 --> 01:51:53.366
will change the dynamics to
minus MU bar.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19567-0
01:51:54.246 --> 01:51:59.857
So if you do that, you will have
you one plus I M U2 will be

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19567-1
01:51:59.857 --> 01:52:02.156
equal to minus of MU 1 -.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19630-0
01:52:02.166 --> 01:52:08.117
I M U2 which will say you want
mind plus I M U2 equal to minus

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19630-1
01:52:08.117 --> 01:52:14.069
MU one plus I M U2 this I M U2 U
get cancelled So what will be

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19630-2
01:52:14.069 --> 01:52:19.831
your two MU 1 equal to zero
which will be make MU 1 equal to

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19630-3
01:52:19.831 --> 01:52:20.776
0 correct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19643-0
01:52:21.916 --> 01:52:31.356
Therefore, for skew have mesian,
I can values uh either.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19640-0
01:52:22.296 --> 01:52:22.436
The.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19647-0
01:52:33.526 --> 01:52:34.196
Euro.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19652-0
01:52:35.986 --> 01:52:37.546
All purely imaginary.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19663-0
01:52:42.246 --> 01:52:44.146
Sir, how did we conclude this?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19710-0
01:52:42.846 --> 01:52:43.056
No.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19686-0
01:52:44.606 --> 01:52:46.086
It's either zero or investment.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19676-0
01:52:44.836 --> 01:52:45.816
Yeah, no one is new.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19682-0
01:52:45.826 --> 01:52:46.646
One is needle.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19697-0
01:52:46.916 --> 01:52:49.446
If new one is 0 means what will,
what will?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19707-0
01:52:49.456 --> 01:52:51.536
What will be this number I U2
only right?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19713-0
01:52:52.496 --> 01:52:53.256
OK, OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19714-0
01:52:54.076 --> 01:52:54.766
I'm you too.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19734-0
01:52:54.776 --> 01:52:58.721
I'm U2 has two options, either
if new two is nonzero, it is

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19734-1
01:52:58.721 --> 01:53:00.956
purely imaginary number,
correct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19758-0
01:53:03.406 --> 01:53:06.240
If you're two is 0, then you one
plus sign U2 is become zero,

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19758-1
01:53:06.240 --> 01:53:06.606
correct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19789-0
01:53:07.076 --> 01:53:10.426
It's not two that.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19766-0
01:53:07.226 --> 01:53:07.396
Yes.

01:53:11.286 --> 01:53:15.996
Can you scroll a bit up for the
Hermitian uh.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19793-0
01:53:15.166 --> 01:53:15.596
Yeah, sure.

01:53:18.866 --> 01:53:21.966
How are we getting a new one?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19828-0
01:53:21.976 --> 01:53:25.556
Plus I U2 is your question MU 1
minus MU two are we?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19816-0
01:53:22.416 --> 01:53:22.576
What?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19830-0
01:53:25.116 --> 01:53:27.026
It is because I'm getting.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19841-0
01:53:27.036 --> 01:53:30.506
I started with the new and I
equated it back to you.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19846-0
01:53:30.516 --> 01:53:31.326
New new bar.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19852-0
01:53:32.266 --> 01:53:32.516
Uh-huh.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19854-0
01:53:33.616 --> 01:53:34.546
You equal to MU bar.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19889-0
01:53:37.356 --> 01:53:40.784
So if you is any complex number
MU, one is M U-1 plus I M U2

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19889-1
01:53:40.784 --> 01:53:43.256
will be equal to MU 1 minus in
U2, correct?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19891-0
01:53:43.726 --> 01:53:45.126
OK, it's consecrate.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19894-0
01:53:45.266 --> 01:53:46.976
OK. OK.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19915-0
01:53:48.466 --> 01:53:51.643
OK, so this is so we can use a
spectral theorem quite

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19915-1
01:53:51.643 --> 01:53:54.056
effectively in getting all these
things.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19925-0
01:53:54.116 --> 01:53:56.316
I don't think I can hold you any
further.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19940-0
01:53:56.826 --> 01:53:59.476
It is almost going to be 10 and
I have broken my promise.

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19942-0
01:54:00.456 --> 01:54:01.586

01:54:02.656 --> 01:54:06.166
What what's meant by trace in
the last slide it's mentioned?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/19977-0
01:54:07.396 --> 01:54:09.266

01:54:18.596 --> 01:54:20.656
I mean, what does trace refer?

617180a9-ebac-4532-ba8c-b6f807688291/20026-0
01:54:20.076 --> 01:54:23.776
This is the sum of sum of sum of
diagonal elements is called.
