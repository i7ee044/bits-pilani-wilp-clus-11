OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/132-0
00:00:47.948 --> 00:00:49.158
And were you able to get the
answers?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/135-0

OK, fair enough.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/149-0
00:00:55.348 --> 00:00:56.248
How was the assignment?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/154-0

We enjoyed, but it took a lot of
time.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/179-0
00:01:08.938 --> 00:01:09.948

00:01:52.938 --> 00:01:54.078
You did not see that statement.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/290-0
00:01:58.508 --> 00:01:59.518

00:02:25.018 --> 00:02:28.488
Can we have 60 minutes instead
of 30 minutes for today's quiz,

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/392-1
00:02:28.488 --> 00:02:28.708
Sir?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/403-0

00:02:31.698 --> 00:02:35.554
Nobody can change anything there
in the in that in that sense it

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/427-1
00:02:35.554 --> 00:02:37.808
is already prefixed and it is
nobody.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/430-0
00:02:37.818 --> 00:02:38.168
Can I?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/443-0
00:02:38.178 --> 00:02:41.048
I mean, I don't touch that long
back into was launched.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/452-0
00:02:45.158 --> 00:02:46.118
So number of questions.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/460-0
00:02:48.468 --> 00:02:49.498
Number of questions is 20.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/486-0
00:02:52.828 --> 00:02:57.058
So as the labels for the quiz
would be till today's session or

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/492-0
00:02:56.528 --> 00:02:59.438
No, no talk about, I don't know.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/486-1
00:02:57.058 --> 00:02:57.528
lastly.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/504-0
00:02:59.848 --> 00:03:02.646
This has put up as an
announcement you did not get the

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/504-1
00:03:02.646 --> 00:03:03.308
announcement.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/511-0
00:03:05.678 --> 00:03:07.678
In fact session.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/541-0
00:03:09.408 --> 00:03:12.531
I had put up an announcement at
least ask my Tias to put up an

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/541-1
00:03:12.531 --> 00:03:15.158
announcement which said it is
there till lecture #5.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/566-0
00:03:15.628 --> 00:03:17.408
So whatever I covered in the
last class.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/561-0
00:03:16.068 --> 00:03:17.608
Uh, yes, we we got it.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/568-0
00:03:18.618 --> 00:03:18.898
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/574-0
00:03:20.088 --> 00:03:21.618
No, I I I still am.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/602-0
00:03:21.628 --> 00:03:25.233
I I'm unable to get the motors
operating which which I can

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/605-0
00:03:24.088 --> 00:03:24.388
What?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/602-1
00:03:25.233 --> 00:03:28.410
communicate with you
announcements are reaching you

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/602-2
00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.838
or not.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/617-0
00:03:37.878 --> 00:03:38.418
Do you think so?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/621-0
00:03:39.188 --> 00:03:39.818
OK, fine.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/627-0
00:03:39.598 --> 00:03:40.658
The answer they are reaching.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/631-0
00:03:41.198 --> 00:03:41.718
OK, fine.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/635-0
00:03:41.618 --> 00:03:44.588
So just one more request for
this assignment.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/656-0
00:03:45.018 --> 00:03:48.715
Can we just be like accepting
the typed ones instead of

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/656-1
00:03:48.715 --> 00:03:49.508
handwritten?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/671-0
00:03:49.758 --> 00:03:52.728
I mean, handwriting takes lot of
time actually in.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/665-0
00:03:49.868 --> 00:03:50.758
No, it is impossible.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/691-0
00:03:52.778 --> 00:03:55.008
I mean it's a repeat work to be
frank, yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/678-0
00:03:52.788 --> 00:03:52.988
No.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/682-0
00:03:54.618 --> 00:03:55.028
Why?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/684-0
00:03:55.078 --> 00:03:55.308
Why?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/702-0
00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:58.358
Why would the handwritten see
you have to just copy the

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/702-1
00:03:58.358 --> 00:03:58.738
matrix?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/712-0
00:03:58.748 --> 00:04:00.458
Sir, you have to say column.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/714-0
00:04:00.498 --> 00:04:01.378
This is RF.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/725-0
00:04:01.388 --> 00:04:03.628
This is RREF and then you'll
have to write.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/731-0
00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:04.848
This is a pivot column.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/738-0
00:04:04.858 --> 00:04:05.908
This is a non pivot column.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/773-0
00:04:05.918 --> 00:04:08.826
This is a particular solution,
so it's very simple and in case

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/773-1
00:04:08.826 --> 00:04:11.734
of the code you have just going
to write some set 6 to 7 lines

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/773-2
00:04:11.734 --> 00:04:12.888
of code not more than it.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/789-0
00:04:15.128 --> 00:04:17.368
In the examination and you are
supposed to write much more.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/819-0
00:04:18.318 --> 00:04:21.138
In my opinion, where you have to
do a lot of things here, at

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/811-0
00:04:20.108 --> 00:04:20.408
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/819-1
00:04:21.138 --> 00:04:22.988
least you're just going to copy,
right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/845-0
00:04:24.198 --> 00:04:27.812
Uh, so VENKATESWARA, just for
the examination point of view

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/845-1
00:04:27.812 --> 00:04:31.608
like we got the the Python code
like we had to write the code.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/878-0
00:04:31.618 --> 00:04:34.625
So in the same way we'll be
getting like we need to write

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/878-1
00:04:34.625 --> 00:04:37.788
the Python code in the exam or
just the solution in terms of

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/878-2
00:04:37.788 --> 00:04:38.618
the mathematics.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/888-0
00:04:40.288 --> 00:04:42.058
It is a linear combination of
both.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/895-0
00:04:42.068 --> 00:04:43.618
I can ask you for a pseudo code.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/896-0
00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:43.198
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/909-0
00:04:44.588 --> 00:04:46.008
OK. OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/917-0
00:04:45.848 --> 00:04:48.608
And I can, I can ask you for the
underlying mathematics also.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/920-0
00:04:50.038 --> 00:04:50.588
OK, good.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/921-0
00:04:51.368 --> 00:04:51.648
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/925-0
00:04:53.438 --> 00:04:53.758
Thank you.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/926-0
00:04:54.238 --> 00:04:54.498
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/935-0
00:04:56.988 --> 00:04:58.818
Calculators would be allowed in
the exam.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/945-0
00:04:58.828 --> 00:04:59.228
Sure. Right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/948-0
00:04:59.558 --> 00:05:00.898
Yes, but it will be seldom used.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/951-0
00:05:03.288 --> 00:05:03.648
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1011-0
00:05:05.788 --> 00:05:08.588
I think this linear algebra
paper and calculator are too

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1011-1
00:05:08.588 --> 00:05:11.682
distant in the original version
of this course we used to have

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1011-2
00:05:11.682 --> 00:05:14.728
some pivoting and other things
where I used to tell all those

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1011-3
00:05:14.728 --> 00:05:17.872
things, but now in the present
version I don't think we'll ever

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1011-4
00:05:17.872 --> 00:05:18.658
use calculators.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1019-0
00:05:19.938 --> 00:05:21.098
Of course we can use computers.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1018-0
00:05:20.608 --> 00:05:20.778
It's.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1050-0
00:05:23.128 --> 00:05:26.167
But so it it the exam would be
on a computer or it would be

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1050-1
00:05:26.167 --> 00:05:27.028
handwritten exam.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1048-0
00:05:26.258 --> 00:05:27.448
No, no, no, no, no.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1052-0
00:05:27.458 --> 00:05:29.108
It'll be handed in scanned.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1063-0
00:05:31.618 --> 00:05:32.498
OK, OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1071-0
00:05:32.998 --> 00:05:36.208
They will give you a big set of
instructions.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1077-0
00:05:36.218 --> 00:05:37.048
What is to be done?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1086-0
00:05:37.058 --> 00:05:38.398
What is not to be done and drug?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1119-0
00:05:39.708 --> 00:05:43.913
Don't worry, dig XI have
searched nowadays 68 the decent

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1119-1
00:05:43.913 --> 00:05:48.192
crowd and now somebody wanted
the the gradients of linear

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1119-2
00:05:48.192 --> 00:05:49.668
functions and so on.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1132-0
00:05:49.678 --> 00:05:51.698
So should I do that first before
I start with this?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1139-0
00:05:54.188 --> 00:05:54.588
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1141-0
00:05:55.668 --> 00:05:55.828
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1142-0
00:05:56.028 --> 00:05:57.058
Only for the gradient.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1154-0
00:05:59.548 --> 00:06:01.568
OK, Today's class is going to be
a little tough.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1178-0
00:06:01.578 --> 00:06:05.909
So you can wish me all the very
best because I I plan to do it

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1166-0
00:06:03.018 --> 00:06:03.238
Yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1178-1
00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:07.628
better, but I don't know.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1187-0
00:06:08.738 --> 00:06:11.948
OK, this is a MF yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1195-0
00:06:14.038 --> 00:06:14.758
Session 7.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1197-0
00:06:16.068 --> 00:06:17.858
So in this case.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1207-0
00:06:20.448 --> 00:06:21.998
What I want to do is the
following.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1221-0
00:06:22.828 --> 00:06:25.458
I want to talk about the
gradients and so on.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1237-0
00:06:25.508 --> 00:06:30.858
So if you have so I I I will, I
will start from the beginning.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1254-0
00:06:30.868 --> 00:06:35.090
So first one is a definition
which says if you have a

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1254-1
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:36.888
function F from R to R.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1262-0
00:06:40.308 --> 00:06:41.418
You know this function right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1275-0
00:06:41.428 --> 00:06:44.678
For example, F of X equal to
sine of X.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1283-0
00:06:47.138 --> 00:06:48.198
This is from Arthur, right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1291-0
00:06:50.508 --> 00:06:50.928
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1302-0
00:06:52.018 --> 00:06:54.908
So I take a real number and
output a real number.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1312-0
00:06:54.918 --> 00:06:56.698
So this is a function from R to
R.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1330-0
00:06:57.508 --> 00:07:01.948
And now in this case you can
talk about D by DX FX correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1338-0
00:07:04.798 --> 00:07:05.158
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1345-0
00:07:04.888 --> 00:07:05.388
Predictive.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1348-0
00:07:05.558 --> 00:07:05.778
Yep.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1349-0
00:07:06.098 --> 00:07:07.748
Are you in this case this
example?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1357-0
00:07:07.758 --> 00:07:09.028
This will be negative Cossacks.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1368-0
00:07:09.478 --> 00:07:10.678
Sorry, cost X plus cosix.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1389-0
00:07:11.668 --> 00:07:17.448
Now I can have F of X equal to
Cos X and he had D by DX O.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1404-0
00:07:18.718 --> 00:07:22.288
If our fix will be negative sex,
agree.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1414-0
00:07:21.318 --> 00:07:23.958
My initially makes yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1423-0
00:07:23.498 --> 00:07:27.480
OK, so this is this is something
which is very clearly known to

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1423-1
00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:27.978
you now.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1435-0
00:07:28.238 --> 00:07:33.298
You can also have a function F
from R2 to R.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1437-0
00:07:34.288 --> 00:07:34.578
That.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1439-0
00:07:37.488 --> 00:07:37.688
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1463-0
00:07:42.868 --> 00:07:47.818
So the other is a identity
matrix or that is what?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1451-0
00:07:43.178 --> 00:07:43.558
Because Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1466-0
00:07:45.728 --> 00:07:47.628
Yes, space.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1474-0
00:07:48.288 --> 00:07:48.688
Sorry I.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1507-0
00:07:48.808 --> 00:07:53.005
The No, this is this is the way
we write real numbers, because

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1494-0
00:07:52.598 --> 00:07:53.378
It's OK, got it.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1507-1
00:07:53.005 --> 00:07:57.002
this should be differentiated
from the usual R which can be

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1507-2
00:07:57.002 --> 00:07:58.468
set or whatever it is.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1538-0
00:07:58.518 --> 00:08:04.123
So this R is set of real
numbers, so I can give an

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1538-1
00:08:04.123 --> 00:08:09.838
example F of X1 comma X2 equal
to X1 plus X2 agree.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1548-0
00:08:11.478 --> 00:08:11.858
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1561-0
00:08:12.498 --> 00:08:15.208
So I give a PAP so this belongs
to R2.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1555-0
00:08:12.748 --> 00:08:13.168
Yeah, she.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1564-0
00:08:15.458 --> 00:08:15.768
Agree.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1585-0
00:08:17.448 --> 00:08:21.258
And this number will belong to
R, so this is a function

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1569-0
00:08:17.508 --> 00:08:18.008
Predictive.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1585-1
00:08:21.258 --> 00:08:23.368
actually from R2 to R, correct?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1603-0
00:08:25.538 --> 00:08:26.148
Is.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1604-0
00:08:25.848 --> 00:08:26.378
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1639-0
00:08:26.468 --> 00:08:30.427
But in this case I can ask for
what is done F by Dou X1, which

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1639-1
00:08:30.427 --> 00:08:34.135
will say that you consider
whenever you are aware already,

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1639-2
00:08:34.135 --> 00:08:37.278
don't we do expect you consider
X2 as a constant.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1649-0
00:08:37.288 --> 00:08:39.558
So if I do that, this will be
equal to 1.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1658-0
00:08:42.528 --> 00:08:42.748
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1677-0
00:08:43.738 --> 00:08:47.778
And this will again be equal to
Dou if by Dou X2, correct?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1685-0
00:08:48.798 --> 00:08:50.238
The houses are gonna please
repeat, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1680-0
00:08:49.078 --> 00:08:49.228
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1695-0
00:08:51.458 --> 00:08:53.488
What can you tell me what I
should repeat?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1706-0
00:08:54.938 --> 00:08:56.578
How is does by do X1 is 1?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1722-0
00:08:57.568 --> 00:09:01.784
You differentiate this with
respect to X1, thinking that X2

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1722-1
00:09:01.784 --> 00:09:02.908
is the constant.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1739-0
00:09:07.018 --> 00:09:08.768
So we are assuming X2 is 1 Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1738-0
00:09:07.138 --> 00:09:08.418
So differential of X1.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1747-0
00:09:09.318 --> 00:09:09.458
Yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1754-0
00:09:10.168 --> 00:09:11.548
You're assuming X2 is 1, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1760-0
00:09:12.438 --> 00:09:14.248
No, no extra to be any constant.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1766-0
00:09:14.258 --> 00:09:15.438
It can be 1120.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1788-0
00:09:15.448 --> 00:09:18.147
You can assume it to be constant
and the differential of a

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1788-1
00:09:18.147 --> 00:09:19.108
constant is 0, right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1800-0
00:09:19.828 --> 00:09:20.418
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1803-0
00:09:20.888 --> 00:09:21.178
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1813-0
00:09:21.078 --> 00:09:24.634
There to be different shade of X
1 + Z + 0 so this will be equal

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1813-1
00:09:24.634 --> 00:09:24.908
to 1.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1828-0
00:09:25.138 --> 00:09:27.241
Same thing if you are
differentiating with respect to

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1828-1
00:09:27.241 --> 00:09:27.358
X2.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1846-0
00:09:27.368 --> 00:09:31.316
You take X1 to be a constant, so
that will again give you one

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1846-1
00:09:31.316 --> 00:09:31.698
agree.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1850-0
00:09:33.318 --> 00:09:33.638
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1856-0
00:09:33.968 --> 00:09:34.188
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1865-0
00:09:34.918 --> 00:09:37.628
So this is now whatever I've
written R2.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1869-0
00:09:37.638 --> 00:09:38.808
This is for example.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1886-0
00:09:38.978 --> 00:09:45.128
I can in general rate F from RN
who are agree.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1905-0
00:09:46.288 --> 00:09:51.108
So where I say this is F of X1X2
up to XN.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1894-0
00:09:46.658 --> 00:09:46.918
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1926-0
00:09:51.748 --> 00:09:59.334
Probably I have something like a
X1 square plus X2 square plus

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1926-1
00:09:59.334 --> 00:10:00.418
X1X3, uh.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1937-0
00:10:00.428 --> 00:10:04.478
Plus all the way up to XN minus
one.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1948-0
00:10:04.528 --> 00:10:05.528
XN no.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1960-0
00:10:05.538 --> 00:10:08.628
For example, this is this is an
element of RN, right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1980-0
00:10:11.198 --> 00:10:11.538
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1981-0
00:10:11.408 --> 00:10:11.628
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1984-0
00:10:11.818 --> 00:10:12.258
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1998-0
00:10:12.338 --> 00:10:16.364
And then once you do this and
this will become a scalar,

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/1998-1
00:10:16.364 --> 00:10:16.788
right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2015-0
00:10:18.118 --> 00:10:18.788
Good exit.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2018-0
00:10:19.088 --> 00:10:19.408
Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2026-0
00:10:19.108 --> 00:10:22.802
So this will be come to R so
this is from from R into R

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2026-1
00:10:22.802 --> 00:10:23.198
agree.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2038-0
00:10:24.888 --> 00:10:25.098
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2042-0
00:10:25.018 --> 00:10:25.618
A great show.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2039-0
00:10:25.808 --> 00:10:27.058
Now what can you ask for?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2061-0
00:10:27.068 --> 00:10:32.298
You can ask for DOE if by Dou XI
for I from 1 to north. Correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2071-0
00:10:34.778 --> 00:10:34.998
It's.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2070-0
00:10:34.838 --> 00:10:34.978
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2086-0
00:10:35.908 --> 00:10:41.418
You can also ask for though to F
by Dou XI.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2101-0
00:10:41.428 --> 00:10:45.295
Don't XJ for one less than equal
to I comma J less than equal to

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2101-1
00:10:45.295 --> 00:10:46.128
north correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2112-0
00:10:50.058 --> 00:10:51.808
Is it 2 variable we are
considering Sir?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2128-0
00:10:52.108 --> 00:10:52.808
Like XI?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2136-0
00:10:52.438 --> 00:10:55.922
First, you first you first you
differentiate F with respect to

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2136-1
00:10:55.922 --> 00:10:56.088
X2.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2150-0
00:10:56.098 --> 00:10:59.357
Then whatever answer you get,
you differentiate with respect

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2150-1
00:10:59.357 --> 00:10:59.678
to XI.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2158-0
00:11:01.308 --> 00:11:01.848
OK, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2185-0
00:11:01.488 --> 00:11:09.529
You want an example so F of X1
comma X2 equal to X1 square plus

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2164-0
00:11:03.148 --> 00:11:03.598
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2185-1
00:11:09.529 --> 00:11:12.168
X1X2 plus X2 squared.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2189-0
00:11:12.518 --> 00:11:12.968
Agree.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2203-0
00:11:13.378 --> 00:11:18.128
Now this F is a function from R
through two are correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2213-0
00:11:19.548 --> 00:11:19.868
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2233-0
00:11:20.448 --> 00:11:26.438
Now if I do F by Dou X1, so I'll
consider X2 as a constant.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2219-0
00:11:20.558 --> 00:11:21.088
Yeah, sure.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2245-0
00:11:26.448 --> 00:11:29.438
So this will be nothing but 2X1
plus X2 agree.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2261-0
00:11:31.738 --> 00:11:33.108
So it's still.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2254-0
00:11:31.938 --> 00:11:32.418
He said.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2293-0
00:11:33.278 --> 00:11:36.078
Now I will find though to.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2266-0
00:11:33.588 --> 00:11:33.688
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2308-0
00:11:35.108 --> 00:11:37.708
Look, sorry, it'll be DX1 dot
XO.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2296-0
00:11:35.438 --> 00:11:38.338
So this is the this is DX1
right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2305-0
00:11:38.388 --> 00:11:39.318
Do I have a?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2316-0
00:11:38.818 --> 00:11:39.698
You do it soon.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2309-0
00:11:39.388 --> 00:11:39.888
Do I have?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2322-0
00:11:39.898 --> 00:11:40.998
Do I do X? Yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2319-0
00:11:41.878 --> 00:11:42.288
Correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2326-0
00:11:42.298 --> 00:11:43.328
No X1 correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2332-0
00:11:43.328 --> 00:11:43.548
Umm.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2349-0
00:11:43.698 --> 00:11:47.817
Don't 2F by Dou X1 square you
again differentiate it with

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2349-1
00:11:47.817 --> 00:11:49.948
respect to X1X2 as a constant?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2357-0
00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:50.728
He'll get 2, right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2360-0
00:11:52.128 --> 00:11:52.248
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2363-0
00:11:52.268 --> 00:11:52.388
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2364-0
00:11:52.338 --> 00:11:52.778
Right. So.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2381-0
00:11:53.558 --> 00:11:59.368
OK, now you can also find door
to F by do X2 Dou X1.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2393-0
00:11:59.378 --> 00:12:01.788
So first you have differentiated
with respect to X1.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2399-0
00:12:02.298 --> 00:12:03.108
You got this.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2408-0
00:12:03.118 --> 00:12:04.578
Now you differentiate with
respect to X2.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2410-0
00:12:04.588 --> 00:12:05.138
You'll get a one.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2414-0
00:12:07.918 --> 00:12:08.298
Later.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2425-0
00:12:08.688 --> 00:12:09.008
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2428-0
00:12:09.328 --> 00:12:09.528
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2435-0
00:12:09.788 --> 00:12:10.738
Now you can find.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2448-0
00:12:09.998 --> 00:12:12.388
22SO2 cell.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2457-0
00:12:10.788 --> 00:12:15.658
So in general you can find door
2F by Dou XI, Dou, XJ.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2483-0
00:12:16.188 --> 00:12:20.878
You can also find Dow 3F by Dou
XI.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2504-0
00:12:20.888 --> 00:12:25.796
Don't XJ dot XK for one less
than equal to I comma J comma K

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2504-1
00:12:25.796 --> 00:12:27.968
less than equal to N agree.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2508-0
00:12:28.548 --> 00:12:29.078
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2512-0
00:12:29.348 --> 00:12:30.828
You can find all these things.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2509-0
00:12:29.518 --> 00:12:29.978
Alisa.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2515-0
00:12:32.148 --> 00:12:32.358
Yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2539-0
00:12:32.368 --> 00:12:37.718
Agree with me, OK, so this is
for scalar valued function.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2529-0
00:12:32.538 --> 00:12:33.818
That's yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2554-0
00:12:37.728 --> 00:12:40.359
Whenever the right hand say it
is scalar, it is called scalar

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2554-1
00:12:40.359 --> 00:12:41.038
valued function.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2566-0
00:12:41.168 --> 00:12:43.588
It takes a vector but outputs a
scalar, correct?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2577-0
00:12:45.478 --> 00:12:45.988
You too.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2579-0
00:12:45.798 --> 00:12:46.278
That it's a.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2582-0
00:12:46.568 --> 00:12:49.048
OK, now this is the second kind
third.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2610-0
00:12:52.998 --> 00:12:57.078
Uh, it's a generalization. What?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2604-0
00:12:54.398 --> 00:12:56.078
But Sir, which is a vector here,
Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2632-0
00:12:57.218 --> 00:13:00.194
Set which is the vectors that
you said it is taking a vector

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2632-1
00:13:00.194 --> 00:13:01.658
and then it's giving a scalar.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2636-0
00:13:02.208 --> 00:13:02.388
Yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2643-0
00:13:03.618 --> 00:13:05.078
The next 1X2 is a vector.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2658-0
00:13:05.088 --> 00:13:06.058
You are trying to say is that?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2666-0
00:13:06.328 --> 00:13:08.768
This is this is a vector
variable X1X2.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2677-0
00:13:09.938 --> 00:13:10.938
Fine, fine, fine.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2678-0
00:13:10.718 --> 00:13:12.158
It has two components, so it's a
vector.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2686-0
00:13:14.758 --> 00:13:15.098
Thanks.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2698-0
00:13:15.488 --> 00:13:22.838
OK, now you can talk in general
about F from RN to RM. Agree.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2702-0
00:13:25.208 --> 00:13:25.818
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2720-0
00:13:26.398 --> 00:13:32.808
So here you take F of X1X2 all
the way up to XN.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2731-0
00:13:32.818 --> 00:13:33.768
This is an input.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2735-0
00:13:34.308 --> 00:13:34.768
You got that?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2745-0
00:13:34.358 --> 00:13:37.566
The output should have M
components, so you'll have

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2757-0
00:13:36.638 --> 00:13:36.828
That's.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2745-1
00:13:37.566 --> 00:13:39.108
component something like.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2760-0
00:13:39.398 --> 00:13:41.828
1Y2 all the way up to YM.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2761-0
00:13:42.718 --> 00:13:42.908
What?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2775-0
00:13:47.428 --> 00:13:50.588
OK, so this is a vector valued
function.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2772-0
00:13:47.788 --> 00:13:48.288
What was it?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2787-0
00:13:50.658 --> 00:13:52.688
Now you can have several vector
valued function.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2801-0
00:13:52.698 --> 00:13:57.131
For example, can I give a
functor value function here from

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2801-1
00:13:57.131 --> 00:13:57.808
R2 to R3?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2809-0
00:13:59.938 --> 00:14:00.438
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2832-0
00:14:00.868 --> 00:14:10.181
So this is F of X1 comma X2 is
nothing but X1 plus X2X2 X 1 -,

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2832-1
00:14:10.181 --> 00:14:11.068
X two.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2838-0
00:14:13.398 --> 00:14:14.208
So what is the input?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2848-0
00:14:16.298 --> 00:14:17.058
It blocks out too.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2849-0
00:14:16.898 --> 00:14:17.108
It's.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2857-0
00:14:17.978 --> 00:14:18.338
He is.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2855-0
00:14:19.208 --> 00:14:19.998
And what is output?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2878-0
00:14:20.008 --> 00:14:24.108
How many components are there
123 correct?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2873-0
00:14:21.638 --> 00:14:22.048
53.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2872-0
00:14:21.688 --> 00:14:22.058
At three.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2875-0
00:14:22.858 --> 00:14:22.988
The.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2880-0
00:14:25.308 --> 00:14:25.778
You should.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2885-0
00:14:30.238 --> 00:14:30.658
Got it.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2897-0
00:14:32.348 --> 00:14:32.888
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2899-0
00:14:32.768 --> 00:14:33.148
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2902-0
00:14:33.748 --> 00:14:35.348
OK, you have seen this kind of
functions.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2915-0
00:14:43.558 --> 00:14:45.008
Have you seen these kind of
functions?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2927-0
00:14:46.508 --> 00:14:46.988
No, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2930-0
00:14:46.798 --> 00:14:47.488
Not really.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2933-0
00:14:47.448 --> 00:14:48.598
Those are never, I mean.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2934-0
00:14:48.788 --> 00:14:49.858
No, no, Sir, never.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2951-0
00:14:52.078 --> 00:14:52.978
Yeah, no, son.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2947-0
00:14:52.328 --> 00:14:52.828
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2958-0
00:14:52.338 --> 00:14:54.998
We might have seen, but cannot
correlate right now.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2969-0
00:14:53.988 --> 00:14:58.962
No, you you have already seen,
uh, but you are failing to

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2969-1
00:14:58.962 --> 00:14:59.648
realize.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2977-0
00:14:59.658 --> 00:15:00.598
Or can I give an example?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2981-0
00:15:01.438 --> 00:15:02.038
Yes, soon.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2988-0
00:15:03.278 --> 00:15:04.888
By you to your father.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/2997-0
00:15:05.038 --> 00:15:06.208
So this is a different effort.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3005-0
00:15:06.218 --> 00:15:09.408
Maybe I should use a different
letter, so for example?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3022-0
00:15:11.088 --> 00:15:15.038
I use it function G what it does
is it takes a vector X.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3036-0
00:15:15.128 --> 00:15:21.028
This is a vector X and this X
belongs to RN and.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3048-0
00:15:23.678 --> 00:15:26.018
This is equal to some a * X.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3065-0
00:15:28.968 --> 00:15:34.038
This year is nothing but M
crossing and this is a N cross

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3065-1
00:15:34.038 --> 00:15:34.388
one.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3073-0
00:15:34.748 --> 00:15:35.478
So what is output?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3085-0
00:15:37.078 --> 00:15:37.768
And of course one.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3089-0
00:15:37.578 --> 00:15:38.308
M + 1.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3093-0
00:15:38.378 --> 00:15:39.188
And Grossman?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3131-0
00:15:38.898 --> 00:15:44.056
So this uh, so I will write
output is M cross one so you

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3109-0
00:15:41.688 --> 00:15:42.728
You can cross the line.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3131-1
00:15:44.056 --> 00:15:49.124
give an N input and you're
getting an M input AM output

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3131-2
00:15:49.124 --> 00:15:49.848
correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3149-0
00:15:49.978 --> 00:15:53.217
So this is something which
you've already seen your class

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3149-1
00:15:53.217 --> 00:15:53.608
so far.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3155-0
00:15:54.338 --> 00:15:55.538
The rotation of vectors.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3156-0
00:15:56.428 --> 00:15:57.278
Not rotation.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3163-0
00:15:57.288 --> 00:15:59.018
Any gentle matrix
multiplication.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3185-0
00:15:59.028 --> 00:16:07.698
See for example, if I take a G
from R2 umm to let's say R3.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3174-0
00:16:00.338 --> 00:16:00.798
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3211-0
00:16:08.248 --> 00:16:13.190
Now I can say you take G of X1X2
you take any vector, this will

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3211-1
00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:16.048
be equal to what should be the
size.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3221-0
00:16:19.008 --> 00:16:19.218
3.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3235-0
00:16:20.118 --> 00:16:26.498
OK, so I will say 2 -, 1, four,
316.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3227-0
00:16:20.368 --> 00:16:21.388
So 3 + 2.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3238-0
00:16:26.508 --> 00:16:27.088
Is that OK?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3242-0
00:16:29.258 --> 00:16:29.708
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3250-0
00:16:30.238 --> 00:16:30.808
Request to.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3260-0
00:16:32.188 --> 00:16:34.958
Is this OK or you are just?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3265-0
00:16:34.048 --> 00:16:34.368
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3296-0
00:16:35.048 --> 00:16:37.578
No, no, you are just bluntly
following.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3283-0
00:16:36.058 --> 00:16:38.288
You said 3 rows and two columns.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3290-0
00:16:37.738 --> 00:16:38.408
No, it's not.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3318-0
00:16:38.038 --> 00:16:43.968
Ah, SO42 suppose I say this is
my A times.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3295-0
00:16:38.488 --> 00:16:39.078
No, it's a 2.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3321-0
00:16:40.528 --> 00:16:43.568
You had three grows 2 years,
yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3317-0
00:16:42.368 --> 00:16:42.868
The cluster.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3344-0
00:16:44.118 --> 00:16:48.956
I will say X1X2 and this is my
function G what it does you give

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3344-1
00:16:48.956 --> 00:16:49.788
any vector.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3355-0
00:16:49.978 --> 00:16:52.606
It'll multiply that vector with
this matrix and give you the

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3355-1
00:16:52.606 --> 00:16:52.908
output.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3385-0
00:16:52.918 --> 00:17:01.046
So what will be the output 2X1
minus X23X1 plus X24X1 plus 2X2

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3385-1
00:17:01.046 --> 00:17:02.078
correct?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3391-0
00:17:03.398 --> 00:17:03.838
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3403-0
00:17:04.798 --> 00:17:07.392
So you give A2 dimensional
input, you get a 3 dimensional

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3403-1
00:17:07.392 --> 00:17:08.108
output, correct?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3417-0
00:17:10.608 --> 00:17:12.348
Yes, Sir, but this is what?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3420-0
00:17:10.748 --> 00:17:11.138
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3421-0
00:17:11.168 --> 00:17:11.688
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3429-0
00:17:12.568 --> 00:17:16.008
This R2 and R3 is correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3447-0
00:17:18.368 --> 00:17:18.758
That it's.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3448-0
00:17:18.678 --> 00:17:19.118
Focusing.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3458-0
00:17:19.588 --> 00:17:22.478
OK, you have seen this in normal
life also, right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3452-0
00:17:19.608 --> 00:17:20.088
You wanted to.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3471-0
00:17:22.488 --> 00:17:25.768
This functions are two to R3R2RM
also.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3482-0
00:17:30.028 --> 00:17:30.538
Maybe soon.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3479-0
00:17:30.298 --> 00:17:30.818
You're not seeing.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3483-0
00:17:31.588 --> 00:17:32.188
You're not seeing.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3489-0
00:17:34.878 --> 00:17:35.138
Maybe.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3514-0
00:17:36.358 --> 00:17:41.295
By come on, you do that every
now and you there is no

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3508-0
00:17:37.888 --> 00:17:39.738
Now these system of linear
equations.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3514-1
00:17:41.295 --> 00:17:42.118
equation.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3522-0
00:17:43.148 --> 00:17:44.138
It is just a function.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3534-0
00:17:45.168 --> 00:17:45.918
See for example.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3539-0
00:17:45.278 --> 00:17:48.658
Now that my like that could be
an example of this.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3546-0
00:17:50.708 --> 00:17:52.498
What is the?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3582-0
00:17:52.968 --> 00:17:59.048
If you see, for example a 11X1
plus A12X2 plus all the day of

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3582-1
00:17:59.048 --> 00:18:01.108
2A1N XNE equal to B1.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3591-0
00:18:02.288 --> 00:18:04.858
Now this doesn't say anything
about this.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3597-0
00:18:04.898 --> 00:18:06.928
Now, if I just consider this
point.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3604-0
00:18:09.718 --> 00:18:11.458
OK, now this.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3631-0
00:18:11.468 --> 00:18:15.179
I will say that this is a
multiplication of a with X one

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3631-1
00:18:15.179 --> 00:18:17.458
row of A with one column of X.
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3634-0
00:18:18.918 --> 00:18:19.248
Hook is.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3635-0
00:18:19.058 --> 00:18:19.498
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3636-0
00:18:20.378 --> 00:18:20.698
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3659-0
00:18:23.398 --> 00:18:23.668
I know.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3648-0
00:18:23.668 --> 00:18:26.308
So if you want in real life, you
have.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3657-0
00:18:28.808 --> 00:18:30.248
If I give my sample of blood.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3662-0
00:18:33.018 --> 00:18:33.908
And urine.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3663-0
00:18:34.168 --> 00:18:34.428
Umm.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3683-0
00:18:37.248 --> 00:18:38.808
This is what you do in your
blood test, right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3676-0
00:18:39.338 --> 00:18:39.628
Job.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3686-0
00:18:39.638 --> 00:18:40.288
Funny, like you're ready.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3691-0
00:18:40.758 --> 00:18:41.298
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3706-0
00:18:42.078 --> 00:18:45.228
So you give your blood fasting,
maybe I.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3700-0
00:18:43.968 --> 00:18:44.818
Honey, come on.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3715-0
00:18:44.828 --> 00:18:45.228
Be Nigel.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3722-0
00:18:45.778 --> 00:18:48.178
If you're not talking to me, you
please put yourself on mute.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3721-0
00:18:47.698 --> 00:18:48.098
I know.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3729-0
00:18:50.938 --> 00:18:51.908
And urine.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3732-0
00:18:52.498 --> 00:18:53.538
This is R2.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3741-0
00:18:56.298 --> 00:18:56.928
Thanks, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3752-0
00:18:57.238 --> 00:18:57.898
Understood now.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3753-0
00:18:57.798 --> 00:18:59.058
Now what did it give you?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3761-0
00:18:59.068 --> 00:19:01.308
Is there is something like
fasting blood sugar?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3772-0
00:19:01.558 --> 00:19:04.248
This is a post prandial blood
sugar.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3790-0
00:19:04.518 --> 00:19:09.568
There is an HBA 1C3, then serum
urea.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3803-0
00:19:10.358 --> 00:19:13.638
It'll give some 100 parameters
and you're in parameters.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3809-0
00:19:13.648 --> 00:19:15.948
You'd say albumin protein.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3826-0
00:19:16.338 --> 00:19:19.682
It'll give some 10 parameters,
so this is actually the blood

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3826-1
00:19:19.682 --> 00:19:21.108
test during test etcetera.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3856-0
00:19:21.118 --> 00:19:24.945
This is a function from R2 to
maybe it belongs to some R15 or

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3856-1
00:19:24.945 --> 00:19:27.538
20 or whatever it is maybe 25
parameters.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3865-0
00:19:29.188 --> 00:19:29.748
You should.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3891-0
00:19:30.188 --> 00:19:33.069
So blood test is from basically
from these two that don't

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3891-1
00:19:33.069 --> 00:19:36.098
confuse it with R2, But I'm
saying that you give two inputs,

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3891-2
00:19:36.098 --> 00:19:37.688
you give several outputs, right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3907-0
00:19:39.938 --> 00:19:40.428
Yes, you said.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3923-0
00:19:40.708 --> 00:19:43.685
It'll give you a kidney function
test, liver function test, you,

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3915-0
00:19:41.268 --> 00:19:41.698
OK so.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3923-1
00:19:43.685 --> 00:19:44.738
you thyroid everything.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3928-0
00:19:44.748 --> 00:19:46.008
It will give you OK tell me.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3944-0
00:19:50.438 --> 00:19:53.036
Somebody asked me something and
then you are now withdrawing

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3944-1
00:19:53.036 --> 00:19:53.718
your statements.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3954-0
00:19:54.978 --> 00:19:55.598
Is a function.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3955-0
00:19:55.198 --> 00:19:57.228
Who said this is this is
understood.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3962-0
00:19:59.938 --> 00:20:00.728
What is understood?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/3992-0
00:20:02.208 --> 00:20:06.718
So vector valued functions
vector to vector.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4007-0
00:20:06.778 --> 00:20:08.798
That is, yeah, that is very much
required, no.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4016-0
00:20:10.768 --> 00:20:11.428
He issue.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4027-0
00:20:11.658 --> 00:20:15.753
OK, so now I'm going to start
differentiating to make things a

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4027-1
00:20:15.753 --> 00:20:16.728
little clearer.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4038-0
00:20:16.738 --> 00:20:18.818
Let me take a very simple
example and proceed.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4041-0
00:20:19.548 --> 00:20:20.238
He said OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4048-0
00:20:22.178 --> 00:20:22.598
You should.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4049-0
00:20:22.508 --> 00:20:22.918
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4050-0
00:20:23.438 --> 00:20:23.658
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4057-0
00:20:26.638 --> 00:20:27.898
So do we write the conventions?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4060-0
00:20:37.348 --> 00:20:37.708
Victor.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4066-0
00:20:39.598 --> 00:20:44.368
And yeah, BW.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4074-0
00:20:45.318 --> 00:20:46.828
Are all calling actives.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4076-0
00:20:51.278 --> 00:20:51.558
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4085-0
00:20:55.908 --> 00:20:56.318
OK, see.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4099-0
00:20:56.998 --> 00:20:59.468
So these are all by definition,
they are column vectors.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4114-0
00:21:00.118 --> 00:21:04.191
Therefore, something like a
transpose, B transpose, W

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4114-1
00:21:04.191 --> 00:21:06.378
transpose is all row vectors.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4116-0
00:21:10.028 --> 00:21:10.248
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4121-0
00:21:14.388 --> 00:21:14.858
He said.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4128-0
00:21:15.808 --> 00:21:17.718
Now by yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4152-0
00:21:17.728 --> 00:21:22.780
What I mean is I will say this
year is nothing but in component

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4152-1
00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:25.938
form it is A1A2 all the way up
to Aman.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4155-0
00:21:28.428 --> 00:21:28.958
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4159-0
00:21:29.008 --> 00:21:29.478
And so on.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4172-0
00:21:31.138 --> 00:21:33.418
So what is BB V1V2 up to?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4190-0
00:21:33.428 --> 00:21:37.858
VN WW1W2 up to WN now should it
be NRM?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4198-0
00:21:37.868 --> 00:21:38.998
It depends upon your choice.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4206-0
00:21:39.008 --> 00:21:40.118
I don't want to get into that,
OK?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4213-0
00:21:42.888 --> 00:21:43.218
OK, K.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4223-0
00:21:43.868 --> 00:21:46.728
OK, now I'm going to take a very
simple function.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4236-0
00:21:47.618 --> 00:21:51.138
What is the function so this is
the first one?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4241-0
00:21:51.148 --> 00:21:52.688
This is the gradient of a.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4244-0
00:21:57.048 --> 00:21:57.798
Linear function.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4246-0
00:22:01.308 --> 00:22:01.608
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4251-0
00:22:06.268 --> 00:22:06.678
OK, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4258-0
00:22:08.438 --> 00:22:10.448
I'm going to define this F from.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4263-0
00:22:12.668 --> 00:22:14.108
REHAN to R.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4272-0
00:22:18.228 --> 00:22:20.588
And this definition is you take
any.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4290-0
00:22:21.648 --> 00:22:27.060
W you are going to get something
like a A transpose W for some

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4290-1
00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:27.748
fixed a.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4292-0
00:22:33.258 --> 00:22:33.478
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4298-0
00:22:37.418 --> 00:22:37.838
OK, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4318-0
00:22:39.508 --> 00:22:40.608
So you you understand this.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4309-0
00:22:40.068 --> 00:22:40.798
How, Sir?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4325-0
00:22:40.808 --> 00:22:42.478
How did we get this function
Sir?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4338-0
00:22:42.488 --> 00:22:43.388
Transpose devalue.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4333-0
00:22:42.658 --> 00:22:43.708
No, no, I this is.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4339-0
00:22:43.718 --> 00:22:45.058
No, no, this is I'm defining.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4361-0
00:22:49.778 --> 00:22:54.626
I'm defining FWD BA transpose W
and I'm saying this is a linear

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4361-1
00:22:54.626 --> 00:22:55.308
function.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4380-0
00:22:55.728 --> 00:22:58.220
There are two properties of
linear functions I don't know

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4380-1
00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:00.498
should I do that two properties
of linear functions?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4386-0
00:23:03.678 --> 00:23:04.098
Yes, so.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4394-0
00:23:05.118 --> 00:23:07.708
So this is maybe write the
differently properties.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4413-0
00:23:10.348 --> 00:23:16.201
So yeah, from one vector space
to another vector space is

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4413-1
00:23:16.201 --> 00:23:16.908
linear?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4448-0
00:23:17.778 --> 00:23:25.395
If yes, well V1 plus B2 is
nothing but FV 1 + F of V2 and

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4448-1
00:23:25.395 --> 00:23:32.618
therefore C times V1 is nothing
but C * F of 1. Agree.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4453-0
00:23:34.198 --> 00:23:34.678
You should.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4465-0
00:23:36.008 --> 00:23:40.178
So these are the two basic
properties of linear functions.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4489-0
00:23:40.548 --> 00:23:44.875
So if you have two things in the
in the in the argument, it'll

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4489-1
00:23:44.875 --> 00:23:46.798
come out as separate things.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4507-0
00:23:47.198 --> 00:23:49.798
If you have a multiple, the
multiple can be taken out.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4519-0
00:23:49.948 --> 00:23:52.498
You have done this enough on
school levels.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4524-0
00:23:52.848 --> 00:23:53.768
I hope you remember this.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4530-0
00:23:55.158 --> 00:23:55.358
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4537-0
00:23:56.038 --> 00:23:56.488
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4538-0
00:23:56.828 --> 00:23:57.918
We remember doing it in school.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4551-0
00:24:02.448 --> 00:24:02.898
He said.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4549-0
00:24:03.888 --> 00:24:04.598
What did you do?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4552-0
00:24:04.648 --> 00:24:04.898
Tell me.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4566-0
00:24:12.658 --> 00:24:14.148
Should I tell you what I did in
my school?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4581-0
00:24:17.338 --> 00:24:17.738
What's up?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4589-0
00:24:18.978 --> 00:24:22.398
So I did this something called
uh differentiation.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4594-0
00:24:22.408 --> 00:24:23.938
Where is it D by DX?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4599-0
00:24:25.278 --> 00:24:26.728
Ohh yeah perfect.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4626-0
00:24:27.358 --> 00:24:33.716
Plus G of X was equal to D by DX
RF of X + d by DX of CFX,

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4621-0
00:24:33.408 --> 00:24:33.808
Used to be.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4626-1
00:24:33.716 --> 00:24:34.578
correct?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4632-0
00:24:36.168 --> 00:24:36.608
Yeah, sure.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4641-0
00:24:37.038 --> 00:24:39.848
So what is there as a sum here?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4648-0
00:24:39.858 --> 00:24:42.118
It splits into these two
correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4656-0
00:24:43.728 --> 00:24:44.278
Yeah, sure.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4668-0
00:24:44.878 --> 00:24:48.748
And what is D by DX of a
constant dance FX?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4688-0
00:24:49.798 --> 00:24:53.618
This is nothing but constant
dense D by DX or FX, correct?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4703-0
00:24:52.808 --> 00:24:54.628
I fix yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4698-0
00:24:54.218 --> 00:24:55.208
So you see the constant.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4713-0
00:24:55.218 --> 00:24:58.480
It can be taken out so
differentially thing is a linear

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4713-1
00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:59.238
operator. OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4715-0
00:25:02.288 --> 00:25:02.518
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4719-0
00:25:02.648 --> 00:25:02.818
It.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4727-0
00:25:03.978 --> 00:25:05.808
So you can do this.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4745-0
00:25:05.818 --> 00:25:09.607
So generally we say that a
function is linear if it is W

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4745-1
00:25:09.607 --> 00:25:11.868
multiplied by something
constant.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4762-0
00:25:12.298 --> 00:25:15.961
In the case of vectors, it is F
of W equal to a transpose W why

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4762-1
00:25:15.961 --> 00:25:16.648
A transpose?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4771-0
00:25:16.878 --> 00:25:18.408
Because you want to get a
scalar.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4777-0
00:25:18.998 --> 00:25:20.128
Here it is a scalar, right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4792-0
00:25:21.018 --> 00:25:23.524
So yeah, transpose city vector
like this and W will be vector

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4792-1
00:25:23.524 --> 00:25:23.928
like this.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4806-0
00:25:23.938 --> 00:25:25.648
So if you multiply these two,
you get a scalar, correct?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4811-0
00:25:27.238 --> 00:25:27.838
For example.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4812-0
00:25:27.398 --> 00:25:27.648
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4826-0
00:25:28.538 --> 00:25:32.678
OK, now GOWDA, transpose W Now I
want to calculate the gradient.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4830-0
00:25:37.188 --> 00:25:39.328
Calculate the gradient.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4843-0
00:25:41.428 --> 00:25:44.878
OK, now you know the gradient of
F.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4862-0
00:25:44.918 --> 00:25:52.440
This is does F by Don W 1 Dou F
by Don W2 up to do M by do WN

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4862-1
00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:53.168
right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4867-0
00:25:58.098 --> 00:25:58.658
He said.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4872-0
00:26:00.268 --> 00:26:01.108
This is very tough here.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4879-0
00:26:03.428 --> 00:26:04.758
Now what is the?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4897-0
00:26:07.078 --> 00:26:11.658
F equal to a transpose, W should
expand this and do it.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4903-0
00:26:12.908 --> 00:26:13.998
Yes, Sir. Please.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4925-0
00:26:14.918 --> 00:26:22.242
This is equal to A1A2 all the
way up to AN and W1W2 all the

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4925-1
00:26:22.242 --> 00:26:22.608
WW.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4949-0
00:26:23.858 --> 00:26:30.521
So this will be nothing but a 1
W 1 + a two W2 plus all the way

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4949-1
00:26:30.521 --> 00:26:32.708
up to a ANW, correct?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4953-0
00:26:36.958 --> 00:26:37.528
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4972-0
00:26:39.518 --> 00:26:43.658
Therefore, if I say though, yes
by door W one, what will I get?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4981-0
00:26:47.148 --> 00:26:47.388
Even.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4990-0
00:26:48.348 --> 00:26:50.328
A1A1.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4986-0
00:26:49.008 --> 00:26:49.348
Anyone.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4989-0
00:26:49.048 --> 00:26:49.468
A1.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/4998-0
00:26:50.948 --> 00:26:51.228
Then.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5014-0
00:26:51.228 --> 00:26:54.818
Uh, if you don't mind, can I put
an I here at an I here?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5020-0
00:26:56.028 --> 00:26:56.228
Right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5025-0
00:26:56.128 --> 00:26:56.758
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5023-0
00:26:56.358 --> 00:26:56.538
It's.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5045-0
00:26:57.918 --> 00:27:02.396
And dried 1 less than equal to I
less than equal to N but every I

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5045-1
00:27:02.396 --> 00:27:03.278
you'll fight.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5057-0
00:27:03.288 --> 00:27:05.158
Do I have to do WI could take a?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5053-0
00:27:03.718 --> 00:27:04.018
Yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5065-0
00:27:05.928 --> 00:27:06.538
Correct too.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5063-0
00:27:06.018 --> 00:27:06.158
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5075-0
00:27:07.058 --> 00:27:10.228
Now it is very simple then now
what is Dell?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5083-0
00:27:10.758 --> 00:27:12.048
This is your right desk.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5103-0
00:27:12.058 --> 00:27:16.703
Do FW1 which is nothing but a
one do FW2 which is nothing but

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5103-1
00:27:16.703 --> 00:27:16.928
A2.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5109-0
00:27:16.978 --> 00:27:18.358
All the way up to a correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5116-0
00:27:19.118 --> 00:27:20.338
This is equal to a transpose.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5122-0
00:27:24.728 --> 00:27:25.228
He issue.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5123-0
00:27:26.208 --> 00:27:26.508
Agree.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5129-0
00:27:28.578 --> 00:27:28.998
Yes, yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5137-0
00:27:29.978 --> 00:27:33.188
OK, now something about the
convention.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5158-0
00:27:33.248 --> 00:27:37.882
I have to say that in the in the
book of Decent Roth, he takes a

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5158-1
00:27:37.882 --> 00:27:39.878
gradient to be a row vector.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5180-0
00:27:42.788 --> 00:27:46.063
If you see some other books,
they will take gradient to be

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5180-1
00:27:46.063 --> 00:27:47.118
here column factor.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5191-0
00:27:47.128 --> 00:27:49.761
So you will find a little
transpose missing here and

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5191-1
00:27:49.761 --> 00:27:50.258
there, OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5203-0
00:27:56.288 --> 00:27:56.758
OK, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5197-0
00:27:56.638 --> 00:27:56.968
So.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5215-0
00:27:57.018 --> 00:28:00.513
So whatever whatever vector we
take, the gradient will be

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5208-0
00:27:57.448 --> 00:27:58.028
OK, sleep.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5215-1
00:28:00.513 --> 00:28:01.598
transverse, right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5223-0
00:28:04.578 --> 00:28:06.678
I still don't get it.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5230-0
00:28:06.738 --> 00:28:07.238
Is it already?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5239-0
00:28:08.318 --> 00:28:08.758
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5259-0
00:28:09.328 --> 00:28:14.582
If I say I take an 8 transpose
times W, then my answer is 8

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5256-0
00:28:13.528 --> 00:28:13.748
Hmm.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5259-1
00:28:14.582 --> 00:28:15.458
transpose.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5262-0
00:28:16.198 --> 00:28:16.568
Right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5267-0
00:28:16.738 --> 00:28:17.758
When A is a vector.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5271-0
00:28:18.728 --> 00:28:19.988
Exactly A is a vector.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5276-0
00:28:21.508 --> 00:28:22.328
Both have vectors.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5280-0
00:28:21.838 --> 00:28:23.548
So what?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5294-0
00:28:24.748 --> 00:28:27.018
8 transpose and W both have
vectors, right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5306-0
00:28:27.648 --> 00:28:31.298
100% yeah, I wrote it now
already is it is A is a vector

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5306-1
00:28:31.298 --> 00:28:31.938
and so on.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5317-0
00:28:31.948 --> 00:28:33.158
So I have already defined.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5320-0
00:28:33.168 --> 00:28:34.668
This will be column vectors.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5322-0
00:28:36.038 --> 00:28:36.178
Yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5329-0
00:28:37.948 --> 00:28:38.718
These are all vectors.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5350-0
00:28:38.728 --> 00:28:41.741
I started the vector and then I
said yeah, I had given a

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5350-1
00:28:41.741 --> 00:28:42.798
specific form for a.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5354-0
00:28:42.808 --> 00:28:43.768
So A is a vector here.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5393-0
00:28:49.188 --> 00:28:54.985
Is it clear so I should write
for example in the in this is

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5388-0
00:28:51.198 --> 00:28:54.688
I so so just a quick question.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5412-0
00:28:54.898 --> 00:28:55.908
So just a quick question.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5393-1
00:28:54.985 --> 00:28:55.468
I'll.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5395-0
00:28:55.478 --> 00:28:56.208
I'll finish this.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5402-0
00:28:56.298 --> 00:28:57.288
Just give me 30 seconds.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5420-0
00:28:56.948 --> 00:28:58.908
OK, you know.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5416-0
00:28:57.298 --> 00:28:58.828
I'll finish this and then you
can.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5425-0
00:28:58.958 --> 00:29:01.788
This is as per the textbook.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5432-0
00:29:05.348 --> 00:29:05.628
Agree.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5437-0
00:29:06.718 --> 00:29:10.308
In other books, in other books.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5453-0
00:29:12.568 --> 00:29:18.898
LF is taken to be though F by W
one do F by W2.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5460-0
00:29:18.948 --> 00:29:20.888
All they have to do FYW.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5465-0
00:29:20.988 --> 00:29:22.578
OK, it's a column vector.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5469-0
00:29:26.188 --> 00:29:26.528
Agreed.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5476-0
00:29:28.178 --> 00:29:28.378
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5492-0
00:29:29.428 --> 00:29:32.962
So in that case, in the other
books, what you get is what is

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5492-1
00:29:32.962 --> 00:29:33.658
your deller?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5505-0
00:29:33.778 --> 00:29:35.838
This is nothing but this is a
one.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5513-0
00:29:35.308 --> 00:29:35.678
Hey.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5511-0
00:29:35.848 --> 00:29:36.818
This is a two.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5517-0
00:29:36.878 --> 00:29:38.118
This is up to Aman.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5523-0
00:29:38.388 --> 00:29:39.498
This will be equal to a.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5550-0
00:29:41.488 --> 00:29:45.435
In the case of decent drug, it
is a transport, so you'll find

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5550-1
00:29:45.435 --> 00:29:47.218
only transpose coming extra.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5577-0
00:29:47.468 --> 00:29:50.402
Otherwise, it is one of the
same, but I think you're mature

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5577-1
00:29:50.402 --> 00:29:53.531
enough to know the two two ways
of representing the same thing,

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5577-2
00:29:53.531 --> 00:29:53.678
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5583-0
00:30:00.548 --> 00:30:00.928
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5584-0
00:30:01.398 --> 00:30:02.108
OK, fine.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5593-0
00:30:02.118 --> 00:30:03.458
Yeah, somebody had a question.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5597-0
00:30:03.468 --> 00:30:05.498
Said seven questions, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5612-0
00:30:05.548 --> 00:30:08.645
We took two column vectors,
A&amp;W and we are

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5612-1
00:30:08.645 --> 00:30:09.568
differentiate.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5618-0
00:30:10.168 --> 00:30:12.318
No, I took.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5623-0
00:30:12.768 --> 00:30:14.368
Yeah, transpose and W.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5658-0
00:30:16.218 --> 00:30:19.258
One row, one column, one row,
one goal.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5640-0
00:30:16.528 --> 00:30:17.238
But both are called.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5646-0
00:30:18.268 --> 00:30:18.878
No.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5661-0
00:30:18.308 --> 00:30:20.278
Yeah, I mean independent.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5653-0
00:30:19.078 --> 00:30:19.918
Yeah, he said.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5655-0
00:30:19.968 --> 00:30:20.378
Wait.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5664-0
00:30:20.568 --> 00:30:22.258
Yeah, he is a column vector.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5686-0
00:30:22.268 --> 00:30:25.563
So yeah, transpose became a row
vector, W is a column vector

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5688-0
00:30:25.508 --> 00:30:25.768
Right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5686-1
00:30:25.563 --> 00:30:27.238
which will remain as WP itself.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5697-0
00:30:27.468 --> 00:30:29.718
So I'm marketing row vector with
the column vector.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5705-0
00:30:29.728 --> 00:30:30.758
It will give me a scalar.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5710-0
00:30:30.948 --> 00:30:31.488
OK, go ahead.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5727-0
00:30:32.738 --> 00:30:38.169
And then we add differentiating
W with A and we're getting a set

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5727-1
00:30:38.169 --> 00:30:39.088
of vectors.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5747-0
00:30:39.098 --> 00:30:40.418
What is and we are saying that?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5755-0
00:30:39.338 --> 00:30:42.450
The night we are not, we are not
that we are not differentiate

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5755-1
00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:42.648
WTA.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5764-0
00:30:44.148 --> 00:30:46.338
I am saying I am
differentiating, yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5767-0
00:30:44.308 --> 00:30:45.298
Wait, wait, that's what.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5788-0
00:30:46.348 --> 00:30:50.403
With respect to W1F, with
respect W2, all of them

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5788-1
00:30:50.403 --> 00:30:53.728
partially and putting them as a
chicken.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5794-0
00:30:55.388 --> 00:30:56.488
What is this telling us, Sir?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5802-0
00:30:56.498 --> 00:30:57.658
What is this gradient mean?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5809-0
00:30:58.458 --> 00:31:00.388
Ah OK, now.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5834-0
00:31:00.428 --> 00:31:04.203
Ohh should I tell this
everybody's OK with me spending

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5834-1
00:31:04.203 --> 00:31:06.948
a minute or two in spend in
doing this?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5853-0
00:31:07.868 --> 00:31:08.438
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5842-0
00:31:08.078 --> 00:31:08.568
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5857-0
00:31:08.418 --> 00:31:08.888
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5870-0
00:31:08.448 --> 00:31:09.848
Please so.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5847-0
00:31:08.578 --> 00:31:09.108
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5855-0
00:31:08.578 --> 00:31:09.628
Yes, yes, yes Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5851-0
00:31:09.158 --> 00:31:09.448
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5862-0
00:31:09.398 --> 00:31:09.948
Please, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5860-0
00:31:09.578 --> 00:31:09.848
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5863-0
00:31:09.788 --> 00:31:10.188
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5882-0
00:31:10.438 --> 00:31:10.828
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5875-0
00:31:10.498 --> 00:31:11.178
We need to go.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5867-0
00:31:10.538 --> 00:31:10.698
Now.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5884-0
00:31:10.778 --> 00:31:11.068
You should.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5879-0
00:31:11.248 --> 00:31:11.468
With the.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5889-0
00:31:11.548 --> 00:31:12.088
Basic Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5892-0
00:31:12.988 --> 00:31:13.978
No, no, that is OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5905-0
00:31:13.988 --> 00:31:17.438
But since somebody has asked it
I this is slight deviation.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5912-0
00:31:17.448 --> 00:31:18.748
Maybe I'll write the deviation
here.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5930-0
00:31:19.658 --> 00:31:25.142
Now there is an interpretation
for LF LP's you see in mission

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5930-1
00:31:25.142 --> 00:31:25.938
learning.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5932-0
00:31:25.948 --> 00:31:26.518
Learning.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5937-0
00:31:27.468 --> 00:31:29.328
We will do something called loss
function.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5945-0
00:31:30.888 --> 00:31:33.918
Has anybody come across the loss
function?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5958-0
00:31:36.298 --> 00:31:37.288
So yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5964-0
00:31:37.498 --> 00:31:39.468
It's a difference between actual
and expectation.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5962-0
00:31:38.788 --> 00:31:39.248
Not me.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5967-0
00:31:40.548 --> 00:31:42.038
Yeah, roughly correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5988-0
00:31:42.358 --> 00:31:46.152
So there is something called
loss function and we are looking

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/5988-1
00:31:46.152 --> 00:31:49.518
for methods so the loss function
might look like this.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6002-0
00:31:51.498 --> 00:31:55.518
OK, now we want to come to the
rock bottom of this.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6004-0
00:31:57.728 --> 00:31:57.968
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6007-0
00:32:02.168 --> 00:32:02.488
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6031-0
00:32:03.528 --> 00:32:09.558
Now if I call this function as F
Now what is dellar?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6039-0
00:32:10.168 --> 00:32:12.878
Delaf is that direction Delaf
gives a direction.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6056-0
00:32:12.928 --> 00:32:16.118
OK, it's a vector, so it gives
the direction agree.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6059-0
00:32:17.378 --> 00:32:18.028
But which way?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6073-0
00:32:18.058 --> 00:32:18.838
Set up or down.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6068-0
00:32:19.438 --> 00:32:19.978
I'll wait.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6080-0
00:32:20.078 --> 00:32:21.428
I don't that you cannot tell
them.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6092-0
00:32:21.438 --> 00:32:23.939
There is nothing like after I am
talking now talking in 100

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6092-1
00:32:23.939 --> 00:32:24.398
dimensions.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6110-0
00:32:26.758 --> 00:32:27.058
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6104-0
00:32:27.318 --> 00:32:27.568
Uh.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6121-0
00:32:27.578 --> 00:32:28.718
Kind of slope maybe?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6115-0
00:32:27.888 --> 00:32:29.178
I don't know what is upper.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6117-0
00:32:29.188 --> 00:32:29.778
What is lower?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6125-0
00:32:29.788 --> 00:32:31.018
What is sideways etcetera?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6129-0
00:32:31.028 --> 00:32:31.818
Now you are.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6156-0
00:32:32.208 --> 00:32:35.283
Maybe it's my mistake also that
I drew something in 2-3

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6156-1
00:32:35.283 --> 00:32:38.578
dimensions and imagine this
function isn't 1000 dimensions.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6161-0
00:32:38.968 --> 00:32:39.838
I don't know what is up.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6167-0
00:32:39.848 --> 00:32:40.898
What is down, etcetera?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6182-0
00:32:41.388 --> 00:32:44.308
I just know that I construct
something called as a loss

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6182-1
00:32:44.308 --> 00:32:44.778
function.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6193-0
00:32:44.788 --> 00:32:47.758
The loss function is here now
for that.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6204-0
00:32:47.768 --> 00:32:51.368
If if I construct a del, this
gives a direction.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6210-0
00:32:53.528 --> 00:32:54.918
Of maximum increase.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6225-0
00:32:59.798 --> 00:33:02.238
OK, any.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6232-0
00:33:01.478 --> 00:33:04.478
So before you go further, just
one moment, what is the loss

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6232-1
00:33:04.478 --> 00:33:05.228
function again?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6240-0
00:33:05.238 --> 00:33:06.848
Why are we discussing in context
of this?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6245-0
00:33:08.458 --> 00:33:09.428
Uh. Why?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6254-0
00:33:09.438 --> 00:33:12.368
I'm discussing because people
ask me why.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6261-0
00:33:12.378 --> 00:33:13.768
Why am I calculating dollar?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6267-0
00:33:14.938 --> 00:33:15.228
Right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6275-0
00:33:15.808 --> 00:33:18.258
Now I am saying there is
something called a loss

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6275-1
00:33:18.258 --> 00:33:18.708
function.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6278-0
00:33:21.558 --> 00:33:21.818
Right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6282-0
00:33:22.298 --> 00:33:22.928
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6305-0
00:33:23.818 --> 00:33:27.097
You will you give Me 2 more
minutes to explain that it

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6305-1
00:33:27.097 --> 00:33:28.468
depends upon the class.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6303-0
00:33:27.478 --> 00:33:27.858
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6335-0
00:33:29.268 --> 00:33:34.037
The class is OK, I can spend two
or three more minutes, so I have

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6316-0
00:33:29.628 --> 00:33:29.768
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6317-0
00:33:29.878 --> 00:33:30.278
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6331-0
00:33:33.498 --> 00:33:33.948
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6335-1
00:33:34.037 --> 00:33:35.988
something I have some data.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6344-0
00:33:36.198 --> 00:33:38.538
It says this is my X1.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6349-0
00:33:38.548 --> 00:33:39.428
This is my X2.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6363-0
00:33:39.438 --> 00:33:44.008
This is my X3 and love to X7 uh.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6373-0
00:33:44.328 --> 00:33:46.828
And then there is a result which
is X8.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6384-0
00:33:47.838 --> 00:33:52.908
Now these are the parameters and
this is the output parameter OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6386-0
00:33:55.508 --> 00:33:55.758
Right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6435-0
00:33:57.578 --> 00:34:01.960
Suddenly I give some number I
collect data the the the the

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6435-1
00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:06.194
data is in seven columns and
then the output is there in

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6435-2
00:34:06.194 --> 00:34:10.948
eight so I can give 521 all the
way up to three and it gives me

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6435-3
00:34:10.948 --> 00:34:11.988
a value of 11.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6458-0
00:34:12.518 --> 00:34:15.596
I don't know how these five to
one and all that combined to get

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6458-1
00:34:15.596 --> 00:34:16.318
this level, OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6463-0
00:34:17.568 --> 00:34:17.928
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6467-0
00:34:18.418 --> 00:34:20.208
But I keep collecting this data.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6471-0
00:34:23.768 --> 00:34:24.138
Product.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6481-0
00:34:25.218 --> 00:34:26.078
Right, yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6486-0
00:34:26.298 --> 00:34:28.028
So it can be about a building.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6524-0
00:34:28.198 --> 00:34:32.328
A building is 5 kilometers away
from Metro Station, 2 kilometers

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6524-1
00:34:32.328 --> 00:34:36.014
away from shopping Mall, 1
kilometer away from school and

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6524-2
00:34:36.014 --> 00:34:39.699
maybe 3 kilometers away from a
bus stop, and the price is

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6524-3
00:34:39.699 --> 00:34:41.288
something like 11 crores.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6552-0
00:34:43.068 --> 00:34:47.288
OK, now observing this is
observed value.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6528-0
00:34:43.198 --> 00:34:43.388
Right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6531-0
00:34:43.388 --> 00:34:43.718
I was.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6547-0
00:34:43.728 --> 00:34:45.118
It's observed, observed value.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6576-0
00:34:47.418 --> 00:34:50.949
Now I get million points like
this, so I go to some other flag

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6562-0
00:34:48.028 --> 00:34:48.328
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6576-1
00:34:50.949 --> 00:34:53.528
that they say it is only two
kilometers away.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6584-0
00:34:53.698 --> 00:34:55.228
This is half a kilometer away.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6592-0
00:34:55.238 --> 00:34:56.948
This is half, half a kilometer.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6599-0
00:34:57.138 --> 00:34:58.568
This is 1 kilometer.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6611-0
00:34:58.578 --> 00:35:00.988
It costs you around 24 lakhs, 24
crores.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6619-0
00:35:01.618 --> 00:35:04.768
I keep on getting this value.
Agree now.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6625-0
00:35:05.118 --> 00:35:05.298
Right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6643-0
00:35:06.138 --> 00:35:10.474
OK, so your collect collected,
let's say some 10,000 such

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6643-1
00:35:10.474 --> 00:35:10.998
things.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6650-0
00:35:12.078 --> 00:35:13.298
How quality 10,000.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6665-0
00:35:14.118 --> 00:35:17.148
Now, what do you want to do in
machine learning is can you use

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6665-1
00:35:17.148 --> 00:35:18.158
all this information?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6682-0
00:35:21.438 --> 00:35:24.071
To generate what should be the
price when I give the

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6681-0
00:35:22.358 --> 00:35:22.578
Right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6682-1
00:35:24.071 --> 00:35:24.618
parameters.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6692-0
00:35:27.948 --> 00:35:28.368
Got it.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6689-0
00:35:29.338 --> 00:35:29.678
Right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6696-0
00:35:29.728 --> 00:35:30.508
So we have to predict.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6697-0
00:35:31.808 --> 00:35:31.988
Yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6727-0
00:35:34.678 --> 00:35:37.553
I'm saying we have to predict
through that machine learning

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6714-0
00:35:36.568 --> 00:35:37.398
Yeah, predictive.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6727-1
00:35:37.553 --> 00:35:38.368
algorithm, right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6718-0
00:35:37.708 --> 00:35:38.008
Do it.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6723-0
00:35:38.018 --> 00:35:39.478
To a reasonable extent.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6786-0
00:35:39.588 --> 00:35:44.358
So you have just this and after
this 10,000 values suddenly I

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6786-1
00:35:44.358 --> 00:35:48.666
come across some flat in Powai
where it says that it is

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6786-2
00:35:48.666 --> 00:35:52.820
actually a 2.6 kilometers from
the metro station 1.32

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6786-3
00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:57.513
kilometers from something 0.67
kilometers from something and

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6786-4
00:35:57.513 --> 00:35:59.898
0.22 kilometers from something.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6792-0
00:36:00.138 --> 00:36:00.988
I want to know the cost.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6793-0
00:36:02.308 --> 00:36:02.698
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6803-0
00:36:02.748 --> 00:36:04.158
No, I I got your point, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6812-0
00:36:03.318 --> 00:36:05.888
No, this is exactly the problem
we are.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6815-0
00:36:04.228 --> 00:36:04.448
I got.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6822-0
00:36:05.898 --> 00:36:07.568
I'm going to kill you with post
mid semester.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6842-0
00:36:10.478 --> 00:36:13.032
And my colleagues will be
killing you individually in

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6842-1
00:36:13.032 --> 00:36:15.208
machine learning, in deep
learning, etcetera.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6861-0
00:36:15.258 --> 00:36:18.148
We want to know the parameters
with which we are going to get

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6861-1
00:36:18.148 --> 00:36:18.848
this 11 crores.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6873-0
00:36:19.158 --> 00:36:24.048
So one typical model is I say I
have a model.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6879-0
00:36:24.118 --> 00:36:25.148
What is that model?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6890-0
00:36:25.538 --> 00:36:30.318
I say my model is the output
price the predicted.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6928-0
00:36:33.138 --> 00:36:42.834
Output price is, let's say A1
into X1 plus A2 into X2 plus all

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6928-1
00:36:42.834 --> 00:36:46.528
the way plus A7 into X7.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6938-0
00:36:47.098 --> 00:36:49.608
I will also add an alpha now.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6941-0
00:36:49.618 --> 00:36:50.658
This is the dictate price.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6944-0
00:36:53.328 --> 00:36:53.668
Agreed.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6951-0
00:36:54.878 --> 00:36:55.068
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6966-0
00:36:56.188 --> 00:36:59.578
I say I take an alpha, not A1A2
to A7.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6969-0
00:36:59.588 --> 00:37:00.378
I multiply.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/6977-0
00:37:00.388 --> 00:37:02.138
I first take an alpha naughty to
it.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7003-0
00:37:02.148 --> 00:37:06.317
I add A1 times X1 Alpha 2 * X
two and all the way up to alpha

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7003-1
00:37:06.317 --> 00:37:07.528
times times X7 OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7016-0
00:37:09.508 --> 00:37:12.538
Now this is going to give me not
11 crores.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7026-0
00:37:12.548 --> 00:37:14.098
It is going to give me some
number.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7031-0
00:37:14.428 --> 00:37:15.808
I will call it as by 1.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7038-0
00:37:19.208 --> 00:37:19.438
Right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7055-0
00:37:20.348 --> 00:37:24.771
Now if you ask me what alpha not
A1A2 up to A7, no, I have no

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7055-1
00:37:24.771 --> 00:37:25.128
idea.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7063-0
00:37:28.368 --> 00:37:28.648
Agree.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7072-0
00:37:29.708 --> 00:37:30.398
Agree. Yep.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7095-0
00:37:30.848 --> 00:37:34.843
I have no idea what A1A2 up to
A7 are, but I just say I take

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7095-1
00:37:34.843 --> 00:37:37.398
this 7-8 parameters and then say
this.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7124-0
00:37:37.708 --> 00:37:41.221
So I will get if I do multiply
alpha naughty plus A1 X one plus

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7124-1
00:37:41.221 --> 00:37:42.538
alpha X2 up to A7 X one.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7161-0
00:37:42.548 --> 00:37:45.977
I'm going to get a Y1 so
similarly So what I do is I take

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7141-0
00:37:44.508 --> 00:37:44.728
Right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7161-1
00:37:45.977 --> 00:37:49.643
the first set of values 5 to one
and then you have some three

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7161-2
00:37:49.643 --> 00:37:51.358
values are up to three right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7196-0
00:37:51.598 --> 00:37:57.333
So I will say alpha naughty plus
A1 into Phi plus A2 into one

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7171-0
00:37:52.428 --> 00:37:52.748
That K.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7196-1
00:37:57.333 --> 00:38:00.848
plus all the way up to A7 into
three.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7202-0
00:38:01.838 --> 00:38:02.938
Here's me why you want correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7207-0
00:38:04.108 --> 00:38:04.338
Correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7213-0
00:38:05.398 --> 00:38:07.668
This is my prediction for the
first one.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7219-0
00:38:07.938 --> 00:38:09.718
Actually, what is the actual
value?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7236-0
00:38:13.968 --> 00:38:15.718
Of A1A2 yet to be determined.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7252-0
00:38:15.548 --> 00:38:19.786
No, no, no, no, no, A1A2 I have
taken and then I am computing

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7252-1
00:38:19.786 --> 00:38:20.128
some.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7280-0
00:38:20.138 --> 00:38:23.986
Suppose I I take this 8
constants alpha, naughty A7 and

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7280-1
00:38:23.986 --> 00:38:28.108
I put in this parameters in this
model, what does the model

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7280-2
00:38:28.108 --> 00:38:28.658
predict?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7281-0
00:38:28.388 --> 00:38:28.888
So we have.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7303-0
00:38:30.938 --> 00:38:34.098
So we have Y1 equal to 11 for
this case.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7293-0
00:38:31.178 --> 00:38:31.578
The model.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7298-0
00:38:32.258 --> 00:38:32.438
11.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7304-0
00:38:33.998 --> 00:38:35.148
No, no, no, no, no.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7313-0
00:38:35.438 --> 00:38:37.378
By 1 equal to 11 cannot be true.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7330-0
00:38:39.198 --> 00:38:42.608
Please understand I don't know
what alpha, not A1 et cetera.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7344-0
00:38:42.618 --> 00:38:47.158
I am just taking this alpha not
A1 and then I am forming this.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7367-0
00:38:50.538 --> 00:38:54.602
Expression alpha naughty plus A1
X one plus alpha 2X2 up to alpha

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7366-0
00:38:53.708 --> 00:38:53.988
Some.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7367-1
00:38:54.602 --> 00:38:54.848
7X7.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7385-0
00:38:55.378 --> 00:39:00.487
Now if you put 5 to one, et
cetera up to three, you will get

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7385-1
00:39:00.487 --> 00:39:01.408
some value.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7397-0
00:39:02.408 --> 00:39:03.978
I'm going to call that value as.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7399-0
00:39:03.988 --> 00:39:04.828
Why you want OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7402-0
00:39:08.548 --> 00:39:08.668
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7422-0
00:39:10.038 --> 00:39:15.297
Now so in this case the actual
value is 11, but my predicted

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7422-1
00:39:15.297 --> 00:39:17.108
value is Y1, correct?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7438-0
00:39:19.068 --> 00:39:19.268
Right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7453-0
00:39:19.898 --> 00:39:22.278
No, it's that is it.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7445-0
00:39:19.998 --> 00:39:20.758
So what is the error?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7464-0
00:39:22.228 --> 00:39:23.958
Y 1 -, 11 -, Y one.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7461-0
00:39:22.288 --> 00:39:23.388
Some kind of uh.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7475-0
00:39:22.998 --> 00:39:25.548
Legal 11 -, 5, one.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7489-0
00:39:25.858 --> 00:39:29.741
So I will say it can be more
than one or less than Y1

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7478-0
00:39:25.968 --> 00:39:26.378
Right one.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7489-1
00:39:29.741 --> 00:39:30.388
etcetera.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7507-0
00:39:30.398 --> 00:39:34.199
So I will say this is Error
square is Y 1 -, 11 the whole

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7507-1
00:39:34.199 --> 00:39:34.658
square.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7511-0
00:39:35.998 --> 00:39:36.238
Yep.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7541-0
00:39:37.798 --> 00:39:41.589
Similarly, in the next decade,
if you put two half, half up to

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7541-1
00:39:41.589 --> 00:39:44.478
one, you are going to get
another Y 2, correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7549-0
00:39:45.718 --> 00:39:45.988
Correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7562-0
00:39:46.748 --> 00:39:49.658
So you are going to get Y 2 -,
24 the whole square.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7567-0
00:39:51.588 --> 00:39:51.708
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7591-0
00:39:52.808 --> 00:39:57.413
So you will do all the 10,000,
so you'll get why 10,000 minus

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7591-1
00:39:57.413 --> 00:39:59.418
some other maybe 28 crores.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7593-0
00:39:59.428 --> 00:40:00.278
The whole square, correct?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7608-0
00:40:01.518 --> 00:40:03.388
Don't just just.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7628-0
00:40:02.388 --> 00:40:06.915
Now this is the error square you
want to minimize this error

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7628-1
00:40:06.915 --> 00:40:10.478
square and get this alpha not
A1A2 to A7 agree.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7633-0
00:40:11.908 --> 00:40:12.238
Agree.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7651-0
00:40:12.468 --> 00:40:17.838
Ohh so excuse me, can we first
have error and then error

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7647-0
00:40:14.758 --> 00:40:14.918
Yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7651-1
00:40:17.838 --> 00:40:18.498
square?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7662-0
00:40:21.778 --> 00:40:24.518
And the point is, errors can
cancel.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7679-0
00:40:28.908 --> 00:40:29.788
Error squares won't.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7684-0
00:40:29.658 --> 00:40:30.208
Ohh.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7694-0
00:40:31.168 --> 00:40:33.648
But he said not able to
understand if you can just.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7705-0
00:40:33.308 --> 00:40:39.088
OK, so I am saying, suppose you
are Y one is let's say.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7710-0
00:40:42.138 --> 00:40:42.488
Uh.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7721-0
00:40:43.998 --> 00:40:45.398
It will be in two dimension.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7751-0
00:40:44.888 --> 00:40:51.998
Some not now like it is, let's
say 24 + 3717.56 point 5.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7735-0
00:40:45.408 --> 00:40:46.738
That is, when you use it.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7755-0
00:40:52.008 --> 00:40:54.278
This is 17.5.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7757-0
00:40:57.628 --> 00:40:57.848
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7767-0
00:41:00.418 --> 00:41:00.778
OK, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7778-0
00:41:01.248 --> 00:41:04.588
And here also you're getting a
buy one which is 17.5.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7782-0
00:41:04.788 --> 00:41:05.728
What is the error here?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7788-0
00:41:09.588 --> 00:41:09.758
No.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7798-0
00:41:10.078 --> 00:41:10.858
6.5.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7804-0
00:41:10.088 --> 00:41:12.338
6.5 positive.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7802-0
00:41:12.328 --> 00:41:13.598
Are you you define error?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7813-0
00:41:13.688 --> 00:41:15.328
Is it Y 1 -, 11?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7829-0
00:41:16.528 --> 00:41:18.348
But it positive 6.5 right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7825-0
00:41:16.958 --> 00:41:17.338
Got it.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7839-0
00:41:18.538 --> 00:41:21.188
OK, so it is Y 1 -.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7841-0
00:41:21.198 --> 00:41:23.398
11 is 6.5 correct?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7855-0
00:41:25.988 --> 00:41:26.268
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7864-0
00:41:26.188 --> 00:41:27.458
8 and.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7859-0
00:41:26.698 --> 00:41:26.818
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7874-0
00:41:27.018 --> 00:41:29.598
Now, in the second case, what is
Y 2 -, 24?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7887-0
00:41:30.388 --> 00:41:31.528
Minus 6.5.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7911-0
00:41:31.908 --> 00:41:34.744
If you add these two errors you
will get total error to be 0

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7898-0
00:41:32.328 --> 00:41:33.278
Minus six point.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7909-0
00:41:33.288 --> 00:41:35.818
Soon it will cancel 0.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7911-1
00:41:34.744 --> 00:41:36.418
whereas you have made a huge
error.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7918-0
00:41:38.318 --> 00:41:38.598
Right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7921-0
00:41:38.998 --> 00:41:39.418
Yep, Yep.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7925-0
00:41:40.038 --> 00:41:40.788
You got your point.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7934-0
00:41:41.108 --> 00:41:44.758
So you square so that every
quantity becomes positive.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7937-0
00:41:46.008 --> 00:41:46.468
OK, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7972-0
00:41:47.528 --> 00:41:52.180
OK, now this is Y 1 -, 11 whole
square, Y 2 -, 24 Volt square up

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7972-1
00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:53.468
to Y 10,000 -, 28.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7993-0
00:41:53.478 --> 00:41:57.863
The whole square you try to
minimize this function with

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/7993-1
00:41:57.863 --> 00:42:00.918
respect to alpha, naughty A1 up
to A7.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8008-0
00:42:00.928 --> 00:42:06.463
So the the final point is you
minimize error square with

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8008-1
00:42:06.463 --> 00:42:08.988
respect to the parameters.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8015-0
00:42:12.098 --> 00:42:14.668
The parameters AA naughty.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8023-0
00:42:18.528 --> 00:42:20.528
A1 After A7 agree.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8028-0
00:42:23.908 --> 00:42:24.048
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8033-0
00:42:25.018 --> 00:42:25.138
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8046-0
00:42:25.548 --> 00:42:30.018
That is what he it is done in
this uh minimization problem.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8055-0
00:42:30.368 --> 00:42:32.458
Now to find out the minimization
problem.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8063-0
00:42:32.468 --> 00:42:34.118
You cannot do something like
this now.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8070-0
00:42:34.128 --> 00:42:36.178
Getting up to this point is
quite easy.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8084-0
00:42:36.528 --> 00:42:39.598
You will all be able to get up
to this point now.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8117-0
00:42:39.608 --> 00:42:43.774
Beyond that, what it what will
happen is you know the function

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8117-1
00:42:43.774 --> 00:42:47.940
will have some, uh, some nice
behavior at some points and some

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8117-2
00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:49.858
rough behavior at some point.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8150-0
00:42:50.868 --> 00:42:55.087
Now, what is the connection
between whatever I have told uh

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8150-1
00:42:55.087 --> 00:42:58.885
till now and grade enough FP
gradient of F gives that

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8150-2
00:42:58.885 --> 00:42:59.588
direction?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8165-0
00:43:00.568 --> 00:43:06.068
They're the function increases
the most rapidly. OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8182-0
00:43:07.398 --> 00:43:10.505
But isn't that we're making
inherent assumption that it will

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8182-1
00:43:10.505 --> 00:43:11.218
be continuous?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8186-0
00:43:12.388 --> 00:43:13.208
It is continuous.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8197-0
00:43:13.218 --> 00:43:15.288
The error function is continuous
because of the nature of.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8202-0
00:43:15.298 --> 00:43:16.548
It is a polynomial function,
right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8240-0
00:43:18.858 --> 00:43:22.595
But we just said we mail have
data where it may be continuous,

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8221-0
00:43:19.708 --> 00:43:20.078
In this.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8240-1
00:43:22.595 --> 00:43:23.248
it may not.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8237-0
00:43:23.048 --> 00:43:23.658
No, no, no.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8255-0
00:43:23.378 --> 00:43:24.288
Maybe I understood it.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8245-0
00:43:23.668 --> 00:43:24.458
I'm saying it can.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8249-0
00:43:24.468 --> 00:43:24.878
It can be.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8252-0
00:43:24.888 --> 00:43:25.548
It can be rough.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8286-0
00:43:25.558 --> 00:43:30.058
See for example if you get an
error function like this, you

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8286-1
00:43:30.058 --> 00:43:34.633
are very very safe because you
have only one minima and that

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8286-2
00:43:34.633 --> 00:43:36.058
will be unique. OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8292-0
00:43:37.408 --> 00:43:37.608
Right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8296-0
00:43:38.438 --> 00:43:41.888
So this is called the convex
optimization.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8342-0
00:43:44.508 --> 00:43:48.524
But if you get a chance like
this, whatever algorithm you

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8342-1
00:43:48.524 --> 00:43:52.610
develop, yeah, you know, you
start from this point, and if

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8342-2
00:43:52.610 --> 00:43:56.903
you come to this and in this
point you will think that things

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8342-3
00:43:56.903 --> 00:43:59.258
are not increasing or
decreasing.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8348-0
00:43:59.268 --> 00:44:00.988
So you you have attained
something right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8356-0
00:44:02.498 --> 00:44:02.758
Right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8374-0
00:44:03.208 --> 00:44:07.296
The minimal because you're not
moving any further, but if you

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8374-1
00:44:07.296 --> 00:44:10.198
stop here, the actual local
minima is here.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8380-0
00:44:10.648 --> 00:44:12.308
Yeah, the global minimize here,
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8386-0
00:44:13.468 --> 00:44:13.758
Agree.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8402-0
00:44:14.418 --> 00:44:18.776
So you need an algorithm you
which will take you from here to

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8402-1
00:44:18.776 --> 00:44:19.128
here.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8414-0
00:44:19.138 --> 00:44:23.638
It'll take you here, here and
all the way up to this point.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8443-0
00:44:25.708 --> 00:44:29.162
So I'm going to do several
methods which will not stop here

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8443-1
00:44:29.162 --> 00:44:31.408
and it'll come all the way up to
here.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8460-0
00:44:32.708 --> 00:44:36.698
If you want a hint that will be
assignment two very outright.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8479-0
00:44:36.708 --> 00:44:39.110
The code for this, I'll explain
how this method works in the

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8479-1
00:44:39.110 --> 00:44:40.488
class and you will write the
code.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8499-0
00:44:40.868 --> 00:44:45.446
So now if you see gradient of
your gradient of F gives a

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8499-1
00:44:45.446 --> 00:44:48.258
direction of maximum increase
now.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8513-0
00:44:48.268 --> 00:44:51.158
So what does negative gradient
of here will give you?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8516-0
00:44:51.408 --> 00:44:51.978
What direction?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8526-0
00:44:53.158 --> 00:44:54.578
Opposite maximum decrease.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8530-0
00:44:54.818 --> 00:44:55.758
That is minimum right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8540-0
00:44:55.488 --> 00:44:56.948
Minimum, minimum.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8539-0
00:44:56.278 --> 00:44:56.608
Umm.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8563-0
00:44:56.778 --> 00:44:59.712
So you are going to come in this
direction where it is

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8563-1
00:44:59.712 --> 00:45:02.967
decreasing, but the only point
is you don't know how far you

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8563-2
00:45:02.967 --> 00:45:04.088
have to go with that.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8567-0
00:45:06.838 --> 00:45:07.228
Correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8609-0
00:45:07.238 --> 00:45:11.194
So like how we are enjoying the
target in One Direction when we

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8580-0
00:45:07.468 --> 00:45:07.698
Hmm.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8609-1
00:45:11.194 --> 00:45:13.358
are going in a specific
direction.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8602-0
00:45:11.828 --> 00:45:13.058
In front of you.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8622-0
00:45:13.068 --> 00:45:16.113
You you know the direction, you
know the direction, but you

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8622-1
00:45:16.113 --> 00:45:17.078
don't know how far.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8633-0
00:45:16.858 --> 00:45:18.508
Exactly. Exactly.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8640-0
00:45:17.448 --> 00:45:20.997
So this is typically this is
typically followed by people,

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8640-1
00:45:20.997 --> 00:45:21.178
no.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8646-0
00:45:21.768 --> 00:45:24.098
For example, you do this.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8666-0
00:45:24.748 --> 00:45:28.167
I don't know your locality, but
then you see this is typically

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8666-1
00:45:28.167 --> 00:45:29.198
followed by people.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8695-0
00:45:29.208 --> 00:45:32.501
There in this point a in the
city and they want to go up to

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8695-1
00:45:32.501 --> 00:45:36.068
maybe I should not try the same
horizontal they want to go up to

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8695-2
00:45:36.068 --> 00:45:36.178
B.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8703-0
00:45:39.588 --> 00:45:40.788
You know, you know how they go.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8721-0
00:45:42.998 --> 00:45:45.999
Well, you might say that they
they can go like this, but

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8721-1
00:45:45.999 --> 00:45:46.368
seldom.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8730-0
00:45:46.378 --> 00:45:47.768
There is a road from A to B.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8738-0
00:45:47.778 --> 00:45:48.938
If you're very lucky, you can.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8773-0
00:45:48.948 --> 00:45:51.955
This is shortest path, but
typically what people do is they

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8773-1
00:45:51.955 --> 00:45:55.013
will go something like this and
then probably they will come

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8773-2
00:45:55.013 --> 00:45:57.168
like this and then they will go
like this.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8780-0
00:45:57.178 --> 00:45:58.058
They'll come like this.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8784-0
00:45:58.068 --> 00:45:58.438
They'll go.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8787-0
00:45:59.758 --> 00:46:00.388
Have you seen this?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8791-0
00:46:02.998 --> 00:46:03.138
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8809-0
00:46:04.388 --> 00:46:09.004
So the point is, the first thing
is you should know the

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8796-0
00:46:04.738 --> 00:46:05.198
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8809-1
00:46:09.004 --> 00:46:09.828
direction.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8811-0
00:46:09.838 --> 00:46:10.578
Here the direction.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8839-0
00:46:12.918 --> 00:46:16.054
If you start from, yeah, you
have to fix a direction and you

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8839-1
00:46:16.054 --> 00:46:19.138
should also measure how much
distance you have to go right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8849-0
00:46:21.338 --> 00:46:23.218
Play this is the distance called
beta one.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8854-0
00:46:22.288 --> 00:46:22.498
Yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8856-0
00:46:23.228 --> 00:46:24.008
You should go there.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8865-0
00:46:24.258 --> 00:46:25.738
Then you end up in one point.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8878-0
00:46:25.748 --> 00:46:29.039
Then you again find a direction
and another number called beta

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8878-1
00:46:29.039 --> 00:46:29.248
two.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8881-0
00:46:29.258 --> 00:46:29.758
It'll tell you.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8889-0
00:46:29.768 --> 00:46:31.268
Take this direction and go beta
two.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8897-0
00:46:31.358 --> 00:46:33.108
Then you'll reach this point
again.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8911-0
00:46:33.118 --> 00:46:36.048
You will get a direction and
then a beta three.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8918-0
00:46:36.058 --> 00:46:37.108
You will come up to here.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8943-0
00:46:37.488 --> 00:46:39.947
Then you will again get a beta
four and another direction, and

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8943-1
00:46:39.947 --> 00:46:41.938
then you're going to beat A5 in
another direction.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8945-0
00:46:41.948 --> 00:46:42.788
You'll reach, correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8951-0
00:46:45.068 --> 00:46:45.268
Like.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8959-0
00:46:46.298 --> 00:46:48.008
So many people in Bombay do
this.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8977-0
00:46:48.018 --> 00:46:51.559
They take a bus from one
location to another location and

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8977-1
00:46:51.559 --> 00:46:53.208
probably in some locations.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8980-0
00:46:53.218 --> 00:46:54.858
Autos cannot go.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/8990-0
00:46:55.758 --> 00:46:56.868
I don't know if you're aware of
it.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9023-0
00:46:56.878 --> 00:46:59.615
So they take a taxi from one
place to another place, then

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9023-1
00:46:59.615 --> 00:47:02.730
they take a local train from one
place to another place, and then

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9023-2
00:47:02.730 --> 00:47:03.108
they go.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9034-0
00:47:03.238 --> 00:47:06.998
So each way you have a direction
vector and the distance correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9045-0
00:47:09.278 --> 00:47:09.478
Right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9048-0
00:47:09.428 --> 00:47:09.918
Exactly.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9056-0
00:47:10.278 --> 00:47:12.868
So that is exactly what you're
going to do in machine learning.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9070-0
00:47:12.878 --> 00:47:14.920
Also in the machine learning
also you're going to get a

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9070-1
00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:15.248
function.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9100-0
00:47:15.538 --> 00:47:19.020
Now you are going to you are
going to start from here in

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9100-1
00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:22.868
calculate the gradient of this
function and then you go little

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9100-2
00:47:22.868 --> 00:47:23.418
distance.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9114-0
00:47:23.788 --> 00:47:26.760
You can ask me what the little
distance is it 1 kilometer or

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9114-1
00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:27.588
three kilometers?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9132-0
00:47:27.598 --> 00:47:30.906
I'm going to give you methods by
which you how you can do about

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9132-1
00:47:30.906 --> 00:47:31.888
doing those things.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9149-0
00:47:32.548 --> 00:47:34.338
So there's minus, yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9146-0
00:47:33.018 --> 00:47:33.638
It's a question.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9150-0
00:47:34.888 --> 00:47:35.578
Does that tell?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9163-0
00:47:35.588 --> 00:47:38.606
Sorry but but the gradient
function we're already getting a

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9163-1
00:47:38.606 --> 00:47:38.958
vector.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9177-0
00:47:38.968 --> 00:47:40.978
Is it not giving us the the
magnitude?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9182-0
00:47:41.488 --> 00:47:42.268
No, it is not there.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9219-0
00:47:43.138 --> 00:47:48.860
You'd see the direction is you
travel, you travel from, for

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9194-0
00:47:43.478 --> 00:47:43.878
Ohg my God.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9219-1
00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:54.964
example, Koramangala to to some
place ohm in this direction and

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9219-2
00:47:54.964 --> 00:47:57.348
you go a distance of the.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9228-0
00:47:59.148 --> 00:47:59.708
Beta one.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9236-0
00:48:00.948 --> 00:48:02.248
It'll say that I mean it.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9248-0
00:48:02.258 --> 00:48:06.898
While I can broadly say this,
this area is HHSR layout.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9259-0
00:48:07.638 --> 00:48:10.298
OK, I still don't know where in
HSR layout right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9267-0
00:48:11.798 --> 00:48:12.068
Right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9270-0
00:48:12.758 --> 00:48:13.808
So I give a direction.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9302-0
00:48:13.818 --> 00:48:18.268
You go straight in this door Rd,
but how long should it should I

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9290-0
00:48:17.628 --> 00:48:17.798
And.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9302-1
00:48:18.268 --> 00:48:22.033
go there for next 10 kilometers
or 150 kilometers or 1

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9302-2
00:48:22.033 --> 00:48:22.718
kilometer?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9322-0
00:48:22.728 --> 00:48:26.238
1.2 kilometers nobody tells me
so this beta one is a very

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9322-1
00:48:26.238 --> 00:48:27.448
important parameter.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9346-0
00:48:27.458 --> 00:48:31.293
And then I stop there and I have
equally likely directions in all

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9346-1
00:48:31.293 --> 00:48:33.908
directions from which direction
I should go.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9353-0
00:48:33.398 --> 00:48:33.718
Hmm.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9368-0
00:48:33.918 --> 00:48:36.730
I should get direction active
there and somebody should say

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9368-1
00:48:36.730 --> 00:48:39.168
you take now this role and go
for three kilometers.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9375-0
00:48:39.178 --> 00:48:40.138
That's exactly.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9378-0
00:48:40.148 --> 00:48:40.998
That's what I'm looking for.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9383-0
00:48:42.628 --> 00:48:42.848
Correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9397-0
00:48:43.638 --> 00:48:47.741
So the point is that I need to
get all these parameters from

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9397-1
00:48:47.741 --> 00:48:48.078
here.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9426-0
00:48:48.318 --> 00:48:51.597
So this negative gradient at any
point the gradient of F will

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9426-1
00:48:51.597 --> 00:48:54.348
tell you saying that that that
is a direction risk.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9447-0
00:48:54.358 --> 00:48:56.983
The function increases most
rapidly, so you're supposed to

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9447-1
00:48:56.983 --> 00:48:59.340
travel in the opposite
direction, which is minus the

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9447-2
00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:00.008
gradient of it.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9464-0
00:49:00.418 --> 00:49:04.666
So gradient of it will be the
crux for the second second term,

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9464-1
00:49:04.666 --> 00:49:04.868
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9491-0
00:49:06.218 --> 00:49:06.438
Hmm.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9472-0
00:49:09.618 --> 00:49:11.528
As usual, have drifted quite
far.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9486-0
00:49:11.598 --> 00:49:14.090
So you have understood this
gradient of a linear function,

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9486-1
00:49:14.090 --> 00:49:14.428
correct?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9500-0
00:49:14.538 --> 00:49:15.598
Can you move on to the next one?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9497-0
00:49:15.238 --> 00:49:15.468
Connect.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9502-0
00:49:17.098 --> 00:49:17.548
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9517-0
00:49:17.428 --> 00:49:17.898
Charlotte.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9516-0
00:49:17.558 --> 00:49:17.898
Thank you.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9520-0
00:49:17.748 --> 00:49:20.218
He said, adequately clear or
somebody still has a doubt.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9525-0
00:49:28.838 --> 00:49:29.788
I'm comfortable, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9532-0
00:49:29.908 --> 00:49:30.178
Thank you.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9529-0
00:49:30.318 --> 00:49:30.818
Comfortable.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9535-0
00:49:30.828 --> 00:49:31.448
OK, fine.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9548-0
00:49:31.718 --> 00:49:35.848
Now there is something called a
quadratic function of the form.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9555-0
00:49:35.858 --> 00:49:37.918
So this is the second one.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9567-0
00:49:38.398 --> 00:49:42.688
There is an FLW which will give
you W transpose.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9600-0
00:49:42.738 --> 00:49:47.164
AW, this is something we have
seen quite often in and indeed

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9600-1
00:49:47.164 --> 00:49:51.736
in algebra, and this is going to
be of paramount importance in

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9600-2
00:49:51.736 --> 00:49:54.348
machine learning and deep
learning.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9610-0
00:49:54.688 --> 00:49:56.318
So you will have W transpose.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9617-0
00:49:56.328 --> 00:49:58.588
AW is a very common function.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9633-0
00:49:58.918 --> 00:50:04.058
Now this is a function from RN
to R you'll agree with me.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9636-0
00:50:07.028 --> 00:50:07.188
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9639-0
00:50:07.728 --> 00:50:07.938
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9649-0
00:50:08.888 --> 00:50:12.428
OK, now what should be the size
of a?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9661-0
00:50:14.418 --> 00:50:14.918
Square.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9682-0
00:50:14.988 --> 00:50:17.868
K yeah, correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9674-0
00:50:15.688 --> 00:50:16.648
In crossing correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9681-0
00:50:16.838 --> 00:50:17.478
In closing.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9687-0
00:50:18.498 --> 00:50:22.818
OK, now should I expand this
stuff a little bit?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9699-0
00:50:25.818 --> 00:50:26.248
Please Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9700-0
00:50:25.848 --> 00:50:26.268
Listen.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9759-0
00:50:27.358 --> 00:50:35.822
So maybe I will write A to be a
11A12 all the way up to

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9759-1
00:50:35.822 --> 00:50:45.344
A1NA21A22 all the 2A2N and AN-1A
N 2 all the way to Anand this

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9759-2
00:50:45.344 --> 00:50:45.798
is.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9765-0
00:50:45.588 --> 00:50:48.508
Said it need not be, it need not
be symmetric.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9767-0
00:50:47.638 --> 00:50:47.828
What?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9783-0
00:50:48.968 --> 00:50:50.148
It need not be symmetric.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9786-0
00:50:49.708 --> 00:50:52.058
He need not be need not be, not
not for differentiation.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9790-0
00:50:52.068 --> 00:50:52.508
He need not be.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9791-0
00:50:53.568 --> 00:50:53.928
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9814-0
00:50:56.448 --> 00:50:58.945
I will tell you when it when we
get symmetric you are getting a

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9808-0
00:50:56.758 --> 00:50:56.988
Right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9814-1
00:50:58.945 --> 00:50:59.648
different formula.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9821-0
00:51:00.998 --> 00:51:02.038
I will do that at the end.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9829-0
00:51:04.158 --> 00:51:04.418
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9838-0
00:51:05.178 --> 00:51:06.708
OK, now this is.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9840-0
00:51:05.928 --> 00:51:07.388
So, but but why?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9846-0
00:51:06.718 --> 00:51:08.698
This is nice. Wait.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9853-0
00:51:08.528 --> 00:51:11.648
Yeah, but why it should be a
square matrix.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9860-0
00:51:12.408 --> 00:51:14.158
Ah OK, this is already.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9863-0
00:51:14.898 --> 00:51:15.078
Yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9875-0
00:51:15.978 --> 00:51:20.878
OK, now in the input W belongs
to RN, correct?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9876-0
00:51:21.488 --> 00:51:21.708
Umm.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9889-0
00:51:25.118 --> 00:51:28.078
So you will W transpose will be
a vector like this.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9895-0
00:51:32.258 --> 00:51:32.498
Right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9910-0
00:51:33.618 --> 00:51:36.668
Then you have an A and then you
will have a W like this.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9916-0
00:51:37.938 --> 00:51:38.308
Umm.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9917-0
00:51:38.388 --> 00:51:39.708
He's actually W transpose.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9949-0
00:51:39.718 --> 00:51:44.461
This is my W then can you
multiply a with W then the

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9924-0
00:51:40.998 --> 00:51:41.238
Correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9949-1
00:51:44.461 --> 00:51:49.831
number of columns of A will be
equal to number of rows of W

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9953-0
00:51:49.798 --> 00:51:51.018
Right, right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9949-2
00:51:49.831 --> 00:51:50.368
right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9954-0
00:51:51.728 --> 00:51:52.648
W has how many rows?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9966-0
00:51:56.288 --> 00:51:56.558
In.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9998-0
00:51:56.548 --> 00:52:01.628
And rows so so it is dash cross
in AS dash crossing then only

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9971-0
00:51:57.338 --> 00:51:57.538
And.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9974-0
00:51:57.608 --> 00:51:57.868
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9998-1
00:52:01.628 --> 00:52:06.544
you can multiply A&amp;W, then
can you multiply W transpose

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9993-0
00:52:03.098 --> 00:52:03.358
Umm.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/9998-2
00:52:06.544 --> 00:52:07.118
with a.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10018-0
00:52:08.758 --> 00:52:11.945
Then the number of columns of
West transpose equal to number

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10018-1
00:52:11.945 --> 00:52:12.938
of rows of a right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10029-0
00:52:12.318 --> 00:52:12.498
We.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10031-0
00:52:13.118 --> 00:52:15.558
How many columns of W transpose
are there?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10026-0
00:52:13.448 --> 00:52:13.638
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10047-0
00:52:16.968 --> 00:52:21.728
And OK, right, right. Thanks.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10043-0
00:52:18.218 --> 00:52:18.378
And.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10045-0
00:52:18.278 --> 00:52:19.258
Your bank said the question.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10049-0
00:52:24.678 --> 00:52:25.078
Logical.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10056-0
00:52:27.078 --> 00:52:27.858
Yes it is.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10058-0
00:52:28.428 --> 00:52:29.338
OK, fine.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10066-0
00:52:29.768 --> 00:52:31.098
So I will just keep it here.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10094-0
00:52:31.108 --> 00:52:38.393
OK, now if I do this and yeah,
and I take my W to be equal to

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10094-1
00:52:38.393 --> 00:52:40.038
W1W2 up to WN.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10105-0
00:52:40.408 --> 00:52:46.188
Now you can say my FW equal to W
transpose.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10119-0
00:52:46.378 --> 00:52:50.308
Now you have a W how will I be
able to write a W?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10125-0
00:52:50.318 --> 00:52:50.888
What are the?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10133-0
00:52:50.958 --> 00:52:53.108
What are the things which are
happening?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10147-0
00:52:53.638 --> 00:52:56.829
This is you take the first row
and multiply with the first

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10147-1
00:52:56.829 --> 00:52:57.208
column.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10153-0
00:52:57.218 --> 00:52:58.748
This is the first entry, right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10161-0
00:53:00.638 --> 00:53:00.878
Right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10164-0
00:53:01.128 --> 00:53:01.348
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10165-0
00:53:01.488 --> 00:53:01.628
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10166-0
00:53:01.868 --> 00:53:03.268
OK, So what is it?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10207-0
00:53:05.148 --> 00:53:11.052
The can you write this is W
transpose times one more vector

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10181-0
00:53:05.358 --> 00:53:06.228
A1W1.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10207-1
00:53:11.052 --> 00:53:15.578
which is nothing but A11W1 plus
A-12 W 2 + 1.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10214-0
00:53:15.588 --> 00:53:17.408
The way up to A1N W.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10219-0
00:53:19.928 --> 00:53:20.068
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10221-0
00:53:19.968 --> 00:53:20.168
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10223-0
00:53:20.698 --> 00:53:20.838
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10260-0
00:53:21.438 --> 00:53:29.506
Yeah, 21 W 1 plus A22W2 plus up
to A2 NWN and last row will be

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10245-0
00:53:28.678 --> 00:53:29.028
Umm.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10260-1
00:53:29.506 --> 00:53:36.038
AN 1 W 1 + a N 2 W 2 plus all
the way up to a NWN.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10264-0
00:53:38.858 --> 00:53:39.068
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10267-0
00:53:39.718 --> 00:53:39.898
Yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10290-0
00:53:40.968 --> 00:53:44.323
Now uh, just to simplify, I'm
just going to introduce a

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10290-1
00:53:44.323 --> 00:53:47.318
summation notation, so this is
nothing but Sigma.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10305-0
00:53:48.708 --> 00:53:55.128
J equal to 12 N A1 JWJ you
agree?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10314-0
00:53:57.288 --> 00:53:57.498
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10317-0
00:53:57.588 --> 00:53:57.868
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10331-0
00:53:58.848 --> 00:54:04.728
The 2nd row will be Sigma J
equal to 1 to NA-2 JWJ.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10334-0
00:54:07.248 --> 00:54:07.468
Mm-hmm.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10338-0
00:54:08.738 --> 00:54:09.058
Agree.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10348-0
00:54:09.708 --> 00:54:09.888
Yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10368-0
00:54:10.138 --> 00:54:15.197
I'm just writing the same
exactly the same thing, but in a

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10353-0
00:54:10.568 --> 00:54:10.748
Yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10357-0
00:54:11.958 --> 00:54:12.438
Umm.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10368-1
00:54:15.197 --> 00:54:18.198
sort of easy way to represent
and.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10393-0
00:54:18.208 --> 00:54:25.220
What will be the last one Sigma
J equal to 1 to North Aman JWJ

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10383-0
00:54:22.918 --> 00:54:23.228
Turn.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10393-1
00:54:25.220 --> 00:54:25.888
agree?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10395-0
00:54:25.238 --> 00:54:26.838
No, that's right, right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10408-0
00:54:28.538 --> 00:54:31.588
OK, now I take this W transpose.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10413-0
00:54:32.678 --> 00:54:33.498
Now, what is this?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10417-0
00:54:35.368 --> 00:54:36.438
W transpose business.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10423-0
00:54:38.538 --> 00:54:39.078
You know vector.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10437-0
00:54:40.548 --> 00:54:45.558
OK, so can I write this as W1W2?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10455-0
00:54:46.268 --> 00:54:53.478
Sorry all the way up to WN times
this guy.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10449-0
00:54:50.098 --> 00:54:50.748
WN.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10456-0
00:54:55.068 --> 00:54:55.208
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10469-0
00:54:57.408 --> 00:54:57.778
So.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10461-0
00:54:57.458 --> 00:54:57.808
Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10464-0
00:54:57.818 --> 00:54:58.948
What, Sir?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10485-0
00:54:58.958 --> 00:55:02.033
What you have written in that in
the Sigma factor, can you

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10485-1
00:55:02.033 --> 00:55:02.398
please?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10497-0
00:55:02.408 --> 00:55:04.618
So once again in transpose the
2nd.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10494-0
00:55:03.028 --> 00:55:04.208
Yeah, six.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10503-0
00:55:05.308 --> 00:55:07.248
So you understood up to this
point.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10508-0
00:55:08.908 --> 00:55:09.348
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10525-0
00:55:10.408 --> 00:55:12.894
The same thing I've written in
summation form because I am

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10525-1
00:55:12.894 --> 00:55:14.538
little lazy to write the entire
stuff.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10563-0
00:55:19.028 --> 00:55:20.928
So haven't.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10566-0
00:55:19.268 --> 00:55:24.138
So I've written Sigma J equal to
1 to North A1 JWJ you see here

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10566-1
00:55:24.138 --> 00:55:28.246
everywhere one is a constant,
only the second part is

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10566-2
00:55:28.246 --> 00:55:29.388
changing, yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10572-0
00:55:28.918 --> 00:55:30.568
Which team next?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10574-0
00:55:30.638 --> 00:55:31.358
Who? OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10597-0
00:55:31.828 --> 00:55:36.035
In the 2nd row, the two is a
constant everywhere and Jay

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10597-1
00:55:36.035 --> 00:55:38.988
Party is only changing in the
last one.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10601-0
00:55:38.998 --> 00:55:41.848
Manoj WJN is constant.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10608-0
00:55:42.218 --> 00:55:43.268
J is changing correct?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10615-0
00:55:44.118 --> 00:55:44.898
Right, right, right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10624-0
00:55:45.358 --> 00:55:48.768
OK, so this again I will write
the same thing here if you want.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10628-0
00:55:54.328 --> 00:55:55.258
That is, uh.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10683-0
00:55:57.588 --> 00:56:06.645
Sigma GA equal to 12 N A1 JWJ in
Sigma J equal to 1 to NA-2 JWJ

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10683-1
00:56:06.645 --> 00:56:15.278
and all the way up to take my J
equal to 1 to LAN JWJ agree.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10670-0
00:56:11.478 --> 00:56:12.048
Umm.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10682-0
00:56:12.078 --> 00:56:13.278
Single of the Constitution.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10687-0
00:56:18.578 --> 00:56:18.718
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10702-0
00:56:20.328 --> 00:56:26.008
OK, now if I multiply this with
this, what do we get?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10714-0
00:56:27.238 --> 00:56:28.868
W and Sigma HW.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10716-0
00:56:29.668 --> 00:56:29.998
Blue.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10721-0
00:56:29.798 --> 00:56:31.108
Robert, that only will get it.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10769-0
00:56:30.208 --> 00:56:37.486
So so you will get W one times
Sigma J equal to 1 to north A1

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10725-0
00:56:32.258 --> 00:56:32.438
No.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10769-1
00:56:37.486 --> 00:56:43.708
JWJ W2 times Sigma J equal to 1
to NK2 JWJ, correct?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10742-0
00:56:38.358 --> 00:56:38.518
Like.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10773-0
00:56:44.108 --> 00:56:45.288
Yeah, I get a column vector.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10805-0
00:56:45.088 --> 00:56:52.880
So then this is nothing but W 1
Sigma J equal to 12 N A1 JWJ

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10805-1
00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:58.628
correct plus W2 Sigma J equal to
1 to north.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10793-0
00:56:54.788 --> 00:56:55.018
Umm.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10809-0
00:56:57.388 --> 00:56:58.928
Right scalar.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10833-0
00:56:59.958 --> 00:57:08.002
Yeah, it is a scalar A2 JWJ plus
all the way up to WN Sigma J

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10833-1
00:57:08.002 --> 00:57:10.338
equal to 1 to NAJ.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10838-0
00:57:11.028 --> 00:57:11.698
Yeah, yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10840-0
00:57:11.708 --> 00:57:13.828
NAG WJ, correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10844-0
00:57:16.978 --> 00:57:17.098
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10846-0
00:57:18.678 --> 00:57:19.658
OK, now.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10854-0
00:57:22.128 --> 00:57:23.538
Can I write this as?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10865-0
00:57:25.488 --> 00:57:29.278
Sigma I equal to 1 to N.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10879-0
00:57:30.958 --> 00:57:38.188
WI Sigma J equal to 1 to NAIJWJ.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10883-0
00:57:40.678 --> 00:57:40.828
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10884-0
00:57:41.098 --> 00:57:41.248
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10885-0
00:57:41.558 --> 00:57:41.758
Yep.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10891-0
00:57:47.078 --> 00:57:47.678
This is an 8.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10901-0
00:57:50.758 --> 00:57:52.428
Then there isn't one here.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10907-0
00:57:52.438 --> 00:57:53.488
There is a one here.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10918-0
00:57:53.778 --> 00:57:55.948
When there is a 2 here, there is
a 2 here.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10940-0
00:57:56.178 --> 00:57:59.792
When there is an N here, there
is an end here, so I will take

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10940-1
00:57:59.792 --> 00:58:01.308
this I here and then this.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10947-0
00:58:01.318 --> 00:58:03.038
I same here and then put a
Sigma.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10953-0
00:58:08.608 --> 00:58:08.898
Agree.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10957-0
00:58:09.648 --> 00:58:09.888
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10963-0
00:58:10.368 --> 00:58:10.488
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10971-0
00:58:11.328 --> 00:58:11.938
Assyria.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10994-0
00:58:11.458 --> 00:58:19.228
And this this I can write this
as Sigma I equal to 1 to N Sigma

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10994-1
00:58:19.228 --> 00:58:22.628
J equal to 1 to NWIAIJWJ OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10998-0
00:58:26.488 --> 00:58:26.768
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11000-0
00:58:28.228 --> 00:58:28.748
Jim.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/10999-0
00:58:28.268 --> 00:58:28.568
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11002-0
00:58:31.738 --> 00:58:31.928
What?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11006-0
00:58:38.248 --> 00:58:38.558
Whatever.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11013-0
00:58:41.248 --> 00:58:41.968
Nothing second.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11011-0
00:58:42.648 --> 00:58:43.218
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11016-0
00:58:43.228 --> 00:58:43.928
So OK now.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11029-0
00:58:44.678 --> 00:58:46.818
Ohh, maybe there is some.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11037-0
00:58:46.038 --> 00:58:50.768
So so this WI said, this WI and
WJ.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11035-0
00:58:50.088 --> 00:58:50.248
Yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11046-0
00:58:51.888 --> 00:58:53.748
That will both be same, right
Sir?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11047-0
00:58:54.388 --> 00:58:54.668
Right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11066-0
00:58:56.458 --> 00:59:00.528
Because this is actually belongs
to element vector W.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11085-0
00:59:01.278 --> 00:59:04.278
So now let's say WI is yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11072-0
00:59:01.318 --> 00:59:01.658
No, no, no.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11099-0
00:59:05.508 --> 00:59:09.198
But she did at the two Loop 2
for Loop I comma J.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11095-0
00:59:05.588 --> 00:59:07.958
Suppose you take that W.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11108-0
00:59:08.848 --> 00:59:15.558
S12 and a equal to ABCD and.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11121-0
00:59:18.148 --> 00:59:19.898
If you do this, what is W1?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11127-0
00:59:19.288 --> 00:59:20.088
Again W.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11125-0
00:59:20.508 --> 00:59:20.868
No, no.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11147-0
00:59:20.878 --> 00:59:25.918
What is W1W1 equal to 1 and what
is W2 equal to two?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11154-0
00:59:26.248 --> 00:59:28.188
Now W1 and W2 need not be the
same.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11160-0
00:59:32.278 --> 00:59:32.778
No, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11172-0
00:59:32.788 --> 00:59:38.968
I'm saying this WI is 1 and then
again we have that WJ.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11184-0
00:59:40.808 --> 00:59:42.458
Yeah, you you submit over all.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11188-0
00:59:41.498 --> 00:59:42.618
That WMC.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11190-0
00:59:43.468 --> 00:59:44.458
You said double loop.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11206-0
00:59:48.088 --> 00:59:50.618
There are some ice for which
these will be the same.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11213-0
00:59:51.108 --> 00:59:52.958
So suppose I want write it for.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11223-0
00:59:53.028 --> 00:59:55.308
Suppose I say this I will write
for i.e.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11247-0
00:59:55.318 --> 01:00:03.248
Equal to 1 to 2 Sigma J equal to
1 to 2 WIAIJWJ.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11252-0
01:00:03.258 --> 01:00:04.338
So what will it have?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11262-0
01:00:04.508 --> 01:00:06.078
Suppose I take I equal to 1.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11264-0
01:00:07.288 --> 01:00:07.808
What will it be?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11271-0
01:00:12.918 --> 01:00:14.038
The blue one is.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11281-0
01:00:14.348 --> 01:00:20.468
W1W1A11W1 correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11289-0
01:00:22.198 --> 01:00:22.538
Good.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11298-0
01:00:22.348 --> 01:00:27.918
Plus W1A12W2 correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11305-0
01:00:28.728 --> 01:00:29.938
You're not finished this part.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11302-0
01:00:29.348 --> 01:00:29.448
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11344-0
01:00:31.098 --> 01:00:40.537
Plus you will have I equal to
two if you take I equal to two

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11344-1
01:00:40.537 --> 01:00:46.418
plus W2A12W2 I want every 1 + R
yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11338-0
01:00:42.908 --> 01:00:43.488
To answer.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11346-0
01:00:46.988 --> 01:00:47.518
Yeah, two one.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11359-0
01:00:47.528 --> 01:00:48.458
Sorry exactly.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11363-0
01:00:48.568 --> 01:00:50.388
221821.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11362-0
01:00:48.878 --> 01:00:49.458
Two one, yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11393-0
01:00:50.148 --> 01:00:55.718
Yeah, A21 plus I is equal to
two, so this will be W2 and then

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11393-1
01:00:55.718 --> 01:01:01.198
I equal to two and J equal to
two, A to two, then W correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11401-0
01:01:03.148 --> 01:01:03.898
Then we four terms.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11423-0
01:01:04.308 --> 01:01:06.528
Yes, yes, appear.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11413-0
01:01:06.018 --> 01:01:07.568
Now all of them are scared us.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11418-0
01:01:07.578 --> 01:01:08.028
We'll get it.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11434-0
01:01:08.158 --> 01:01:10.948
Get a scalar. So that's what I'm
going to do now.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11463-0
01:01:11.038 --> 01:01:15.660
So you will get a W1 square and
there is a W2 square W 1 square

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11463-1
01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:16.888
will have a 11W2.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11473-0
01:01:16.898 --> 01:01:22.228
Square will have WW2A22, so you
will find two things correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11481-0
01:01:25.318 --> 01:01:26.118
If you expand this.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11491-0
01:01:27.808 --> 01:01:30.368
Carefully, you will have.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11496-0
01:01:30.428 --> 01:01:32.738
This is nothing but Sigma.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11513-0
01:01:36.458 --> 01:01:43.698
El To one to N and uh WI square
AI.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11521-0
01:01:44.388 --> 01:01:47.598
Plus Sigma I not equal to J.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11524-0
01:01:51.068 --> 01:01:51.958
WI.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11526-0
01:01:53.538 --> 01:01:54.138
ARIJIT.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11531-0
01:01:56.438 --> 01:01:57.098
Division.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11532-0
01:01:56.738 --> 01:01:58.018
Yep, correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11534-0
01:02:00.658 --> 01:02:00.828
Just.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11537-0
01:02:03.018 --> 01:02:03.298
Body.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11539-0

Yes or yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11551-0
01:02:10.008 --> 01:02:10.678
How are you getting there?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11563-0
01:02:12.878 --> 01:02:13.278
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11567-0
01:02:13.338 --> 01:02:13.878
Uh, yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11564-0
01:02:14.268 --> 01:02:14.818
No, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11572-0
01:02:14.638 --> 01:02:14.938
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11569-0
01:02:14.828 --> 01:02:15.338

No, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11606-0
01:02:16.078 --> 01:02:21.979
But but you you will get all you
take only those I equal to J you

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11589-0
01:02:16.088 --> 01:02:18.068
This one I the last.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11606-1
01:02:21.979 --> 01:02:25.198
will get N products where which
is.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11631-0
01:02:25.208 --> 01:02:28.740
So in this case, we've got two
products which are square terms,

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11631-1
01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:29.458
not W1W1W2W2.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11655-0
01:02:29.468 --> 01:02:34.024
You got two square 22 squares,
the others will be the off

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11649-0
01:02:33.968 --> 01:02:34.198
Right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11655-1
01:02:34.024 --> 01:02:37.088
diagonal elements are 2112, et
cetera.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11663-0
01:02:37.898 --> 01:02:38.868
That's what I'm writing.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11669-0
01:02:38.878 --> 01:02:41.708
It does 2 terms now.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11696-0
01:02:41.928 --> 01:02:46.453
If you want to differentiate
this so I will write F of W, my

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11696-1
01:02:46.453 --> 01:02:50.088
final FW is nothing but Sigma I
equal to 1 to N.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11719-0
01:02:51.638 --> 01:03:02.328
WI square AIA plus Sigma J not
equal to IWINI JWJ agree.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11753-0
01:03:05.128 --> 01:03:08.268
Now, how do you say in between?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11743-0
01:03:05.688 --> 01:03:07.858
But sorry in between, sorry.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11740-0
01:03:06.398 --> 01:03:06.558
Yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11761-0
01:03:07.868 --> 01:03:10.428
In between, you're putting the
plus symbol, so it's the for

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11761-1
01:03:10.428 --> 01:03:11.538
loop is not for two times.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11770-0
01:03:11.548 --> 01:03:11.888
Right Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11768-0
01:03:12.038 --> 01:03:12.528
No, no, no.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11772-0
01:03:12.538 --> 01:03:13.218
This is separate.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11777-0
01:03:14.208 --> 01:03:14.888
This is setting.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11798-0
01:03:16.248 --> 01:03:18.977
Then the I, J component is
coming for the 2nd component

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11798-1
01:03:18.977 --> 01:03:19.708
also right Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11827-0
01:03:19.918 --> 01:03:24.067
Yeah, you go, you actually you
go from J equal to 1 to N and I

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11827-1
01:03:24.067 --> 01:03:27.228
equal to 1 to N But I should not
be equal to J.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11824-0
01:03:28.168 --> 01:03:28.378
No.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11855-0
01:03:28.468 --> 01:03:31.947
So no need to mention that Sigma
over the server I equal to 1 to

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11855-1
01:03:31.947 --> 01:03:33.178
N the second component.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11856-0
01:03:33.798 --> 01:03:34.488
I've done it now.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11860-0
01:03:34.498 --> 01:03:35.158
Now you take it.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11870-0
01:03:36.818 --> 01:03:38.128
OK, now OK, now it's fine.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11898-0
01:03:38.138 --> 01:03:39.718
Yes, the earlier one, it's not
there.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11886-0
01:03:38.688 --> 01:03:39.798
I when?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11888-0
01:03:39.808 --> 01:03:40.198
When, when?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11925-0
01:03:40.208 --> 01:03:43.370
When I say it's a Sigma where J
is not equal to Y, you are

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11925-1
01:03:43.370 --> 01:03:46.693
supposed to take all possible
combinations of I and J where I

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11925-2
01:03:46.693 --> 01:03:47.658
is not equal to J.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11975-0
01:03:47.808 --> 01:03:51.092
That's a convention speaker, or
if you want explicitly a double

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11939-0
01:03:48.388 --> 01:03:49.948
OK, Sir. OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11975-1
01:03:51.092 --> 01:03:54.119
loop to be mentioned, and the
disclaimer Jay should not be

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11975-2
01:03:54.119 --> 01:03:57.454
equal to it is what I have done
now, but henceforth going I will

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11975-3
01:03:57.454 --> 01:03:58.788
just say J not equal to I.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11991-0
01:03:59.118 --> 01:04:05.538
Now you try telling me though F
by let's even do do W1 now.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/11993-0
01:04:05.548 --> 01:04:06.088
What would that be?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12005-0
01:04:10.418 --> 01:04:11.878
Sir, can you go a bit up?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12006-0
01:04:12.418 --> 01:04:12.878
Yeah, sure.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12010-0
01:04:14.808 --> 01:04:16.058
Uh, yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12014-0
01:04:16.108 --> 01:04:16.808
Yeah, only, yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12018-0
01:04:19.598 --> 01:04:20.208
A ^2.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12028-0
01:04:27.188 --> 01:04:27.358
Sorry.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12036-0
01:04:27.418 --> 01:04:28.638
Finds it, finds it.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12031-0
01:04:28.418 --> 01:04:29.428
OK, fine.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12039-0
01:04:29.438 --> 01:04:30.528
So you can take it.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12056-0
01:04:30.538 --> 01:04:34.288
Can you try telling me what is
W1 in this?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12076-0
01:04:35.238 --> 01:04:38.933
If you take I equal to 1 to
north, only the first component,

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12076-1
01:04:38.933 --> 01:04:41.538
you'll have a partial
derivative, correct?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12088-0
01:04:42.838 --> 01:04:44.058
2W1A11.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12089-0
01:04:43.818 --> 01:04:45.348
2W1A11.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12096-0
01:04:47.408 --> 01:04:49.718
1A11.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12099-0
01:04:49.768 --> 01:04:50.938
OK plus.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12110-0
01:04:53.298 --> 01:04:54.438
2W2A22.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12118-0
01:04:55.758 --> 01:04:56.778
Think about it and tell me.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12125-0
01:04:57.828 --> 01:04:59.098
Also it will be 0.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12139-0
01:04:59.968 --> 01:05:04.258
Wait right then I equal to 1.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12132-0
01:05:00.178 --> 01:05:00.528
Tito.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12138-0
01:05:01.138 --> 01:05:02.378
W2A21.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12148-0
01:05:06.428 --> 01:05:07.778
Then I is equal to 1.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12153-0
01:05:10.568 --> 01:05:11.458
What will happen?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12163-0
01:05:11.508 --> 01:05:13.088
You can't maybe equal to 1.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12186-0
01:05:13.698 --> 01:05:17.058
You want to W2 plus 821 W 1.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12179-0
01:05:16.538 --> 01:05:17.718
No, no, no, no, let's not.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12187-0
01:05:17.728 --> 01:05:18.918
Let's not get into that.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12197-0
01:05:18.928 --> 01:05:20.388
You're you're getting into the
formula type.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12220-0
01:05:20.398 --> 01:05:25.035
I'm just thinking logically when
my eye is equal to 1, can JB

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12220-1
01:05:25.035 --> 01:05:25.858
equal to 1?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12222-0
01:05:26.548 --> 01:05:28.678
No, no. So.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12224-0
01:05:26.988 --> 01:05:27.788
No, Sir, no.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12225-0
01:05:27.418 --> 01:05:27.858
No, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12275-0
01:05:28.998 --> 01:05:35.492
For I equal to 1, you cannot
have J equal to 1, so you take I

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12275-1
01:05:35.492 --> 01:05:41.568
equal to 1 means you'll have
only one term W one and then

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12267-0
01:05:41.138 --> 01:05:41.728
821.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12275-2
01:05:41.568 --> 01:05:43.768
yeah one JWJ correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12283-0
01:05:44.848 --> 01:05:45.448
He is here.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12284-0
01:05:45.178 --> 01:05:45.518
Is.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12291-0
01:05:45.868 --> 01:05:46.348
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12294-0
01:05:46.328 --> 01:05:46.948
821.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12298-0
01:05:47.148 --> 01:05:48.968
OK, so that will be a Sigma,
right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12309-0
01:05:50.728 --> 01:05:51.188
He is.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12313-0
01:05:51.258 --> 01:05:51.758
Yes, ma'am.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12327-0
01:05:51.898 --> 01:05:55.908
So how come it is coming to W 1,
Sir through W 1?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12336-0
01:05:55.448 --> 01:05:58.448
Because this W 1 square, not the
square, will have a tool review.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12353-0
01:05:59.418 --> 01:06:04.856
If you have five X equal to X
^2, EF by DX will be equal to

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12353-1
01:06:04.856 --> 01:06:05.128
2X.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12360-0
01:06:06.418 --> 01:06:06.928
OK, OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12370-0
01:06:07.478 --> 01:06:10.668
But this is 2 W one now here in
this case what will you get?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12383-0
01:06:20.708 --> 01:06:21.518
8217.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12392-0
01:06:21.848 --> 01:06:23.178
You want to W2.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12396-0
01:06:23.558 --> 01:06:25.328
So if you take the no no.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12406-0
01:06:25.678 --> 01:06:29.208
If you take this W one alone,
what will you get?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12422-0
01:06:29.758 --> 01:06:31.608
This is this I equal to 1.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12416-0
01:06:30.548 --> 01:06:30.718
Yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12435-0
01:06:31.958 --> 01:06:36.858
So for all J's, for all J's, you
get a valid number, right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12426-0
01:06:32.458 --> 01:06:32.788
Fine.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12442-0
01:06:38.918 --> 01:06:39.318
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12449-0
01:06:39.658 --> 01:06:40.248
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12453-0
01:06:41.248 --> 01:06:42.318
You are getting my point.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12480-0
01:06:42.368 --> 01:06:45.338
If I expand this, I take I equal
to 1.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12489-0
01:06:44.018 --> 01:06:45.678
There's so many of you.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12491-0
01:06:45.378 --> 01:06:47.278
But we have an example on the
top.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12513-0
01:06:45.628 --> 01:06:51.613
If I take I equal to 1, SOW one
will be there but there will be

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12513-1
01:06:51.613 --> 01:06:55.448
a Sigma which is from J equal to
1 to N.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12521-0
01:06:56.958 --> 01:06:57.828
Yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12529-0
01:06:57.948 --> 01:07:02.958
One day, WJ right J is not equal
to 1.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12539-0
01:07:04.748 --> 01:07:05.308
Yeah, sure.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12572-0
01:07:05.178 --> 01:07:14.410
So yeah, 1JA12W2A13W3A14W4A15W-5
up to A1 NWN will be there,

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12542-0
01:07:05.568 --> 01:07:06.078
Yes, and.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12572-1
01:07:14.410 --> 01:07:15.318
right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12574-0
01:07:16.678 --> 01:07:17.228
Very true.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12580-0
01:07:17.518 --> 01:07:17.788
Right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12591-0
01:07:17.958 --> 01:07:23.138
Now when you take J equal to 1,
can I be equal to 1?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12607-0
01:07:25.868 --> 01:07:26.088
No.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12601-0
01:07:25.958 --> 01:07:26.138
No.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12614-0
01:07:26.328 --> 01:07:27.828
Not in this case, Sir, no.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12612-0
01:07:26.558 --> 01:07:28.568
No, because Jay is not equal to
I.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12610-0
01:07:27.398 --> 01:07:27.578
No.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12623-0
01:07:28.898 --> 01:07:31.208
So you will get exactly 2 terms.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12630-0
01:07:31.218 --> 01:07:33.778
I will write those two terms
here plus Sigma.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12643-0
01:07:39.298 --> 01:07:43.278
J not equal to Ki will just
write the symbol.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12659-0
01:07:46.818 --> 01:07:52.748
WJAJK plus Sigma K not equal to
J.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12663-0
01:07:52.758 --> 01:07:55.138
The same thing AKJ.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12672-0
01:07:57.308 --> 01:08:00.048
Come, Vijay, this is what you'll
get.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12681-0
01:08:09.058 --> 01:08:09.608
How's that?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12691-0
01:08:09.658 --> 01:08:11.008
No, still not getting paid.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12692-0
01:08:10.788 --> 01:08:12.118
I am saying OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12705-0
01:08:14.058 --> 01:08:15.288
What I'm saying is the
following.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12717-0
01:08:16.508 --> 01:08:20.778
If you do this product, if you
take I'm I'm differentiating.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12729-0
01:08:20.928 --> 01:08:24.838
This is I can I this is I I I
this is.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12743-0
01:08:34.538 --> 01:08:36.928
Said on the top, you had taken a
small equation.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12753-0
01:08:36.938 --> 01:08:38.198
You can explain with that I
guess.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12756-0
01:08:39.558 --> 01:08:40.098
Which one?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12762-0
01:08:40.458 --> 01:08:41.348
No, I'm.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12765-0
01:08:40.708 --> 01:08:40.838
Yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12787-0
01:08:41.358 --> 01:08:47.324
I'm just saying this is what you
will get for this is OK, I can

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12787-1
01:08:47.324 --> 01:08:50.028
write it for any K like this.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12808-0
01:08:50.878 --> 01:08:54.009
Now if I differentiate anything
with respect to K, only the K,

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12808-1
01:08:54.009 --> 01:08:55.748
the element will come here,
right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12844-0
01:08:58.748 --> 01:09:02.388
If I want to differentiate it,
it'll have only the kit.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12855-0
01:08:58.898 --> 01:09:02.148
There will be, there will be
some.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12840-0
01:09:00.038 --> 01:09:00.358
It's a.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12854-0
01:09:00.758 --> 01:09:01.398
He is here.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12858-0
01:09:02.398 --> 01:09:03.468
So what is the cat element?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12869-0
01:09:03.778 --> 01:09:05.468
WK Square, AK, right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12875-0
01:09:07.088 --> 01:09:07.388
It's a.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12879-0
01:09:07.318 --> 01:09:07.898
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12894-0
01:09:08.118 --> 01:09:12.108
If you differentiate WK square
AKA K with respect WK, you will

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12894-1
01:09:12.108 --> 01:09:13.248
get 2 WKKK, right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12907-0
01:09:15.328 --> 01:09:15.508
Yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12913-0
01:09:15.828 --> 01:09:16.388
Is it?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12908-0
01:09:15.948 --> 01:09:16.248
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12927-0
01:09:16.888 --> 01:09:22.058
Bless you want differentiate now
this element with respect to WK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12920-0
01:09:17.538 --> 01:09:18.078
Yes, thank you.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12956-0
01:09:22.908 --> 01:09:26.237
Now in the WK, when you
differentiate, this will when

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12956-1
01:09:26.237 --> 01:09:29.935
you differentiate with respect
to this WI you are using the

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12956-2
01:09:29.935 --> 01:09:31.538
product tool correct here.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12986-0
01:09:34.568 --> 01:09:35.178
He said.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12966-0
01:09:34.588 --> 01:09:34.878
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12972-0
01:09:34.888 --> 01:09:36.058
That's the two W.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12990-0
01:09:36.068 --> 01:09:37.398
That's why you're saying 2
times.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12999-0
01:09:36.248 --> 01:09:37.628
No, there will be some.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12995-0
01:09:36.268 --> 01:09:36.518
I'm good.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13002-0
01:09:37.408 --> 01:09:37.768
OK, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/12996-0
01:09:37.558 --> 01:09:38.428
No, no, no, no.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13008-0
01:09:38.468 --> 01:09:40.528
To the to the two is not coming
anywhere.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13030-0
01:09:40.538 --> 01:09:45.661
Here I am saying if you do
differentiate this this with

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13030-1
01:09:45.661 --> 01:09:48.498
respect to WWK you will get OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13036-0
01:09:48.558 --> 01:09:50.558
Maybe you don't know the.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13076-0
01:09:50.628 --> 01:09:57.458
OK, I thought you must know this
in the previous example when in

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13064-0
01:09:54.078 --> 01:09:56.388
Look, I want to say like, yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13076-1
01:09:57.458 --> 01:10:03.552
the previous example when you
had a F of W to be equal to

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13076-2
01:10:03.552 --> 01:10:04.498
Sigma AI.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13092-0
01:10:05.228 --> 01:10:07.738
WI this is what you got then the
previous example.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13106-0
01:10:13.238 --> 01:10:13.668
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13115-0
01:10:13.498 --> 01:10:15.488
I transpose W first one.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13113-0
01:10:13.818 --> 01:10:16.068
The first. Hmm.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13121-0
01:10:15.898 --> 01:10:19.358
Now if you differentiate W with
respect to.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13117-0
01:10:16.538 --> 01:10:16.838
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13139-0
01:10:20.728 --> 01:10:28.038
WK what you get is now nothing
but Sigma AI delta IK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13149-0
01:10:28.438 --> 01:10:29.288
Now, what is this?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13162-0
01:10:29.298 --> 01:10:33.028
Delta IK is your differentiating
W with respect to WK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13185-0
01:10:33.158 --> 01:10:37.159
It's a delta, IDK how Delta IK
is defined as this is equal to

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13188-0
01:10:36.858 --> 01:10:37.338
Hello.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13185-1
01:10:37.159 --> 01:10:37.288
1.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13192-0
01:10:37.678 --> 01:10:40.258
If I equal to K0, otherwise.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13195-0
01:10:44.268 --> 01:10:44.528
Correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13197-0
01:10:45.118 --> 01:10:45.298
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13222-0
01:10:46.698 --> 01:10:50.447
So now if you say this is I
equal to 1 to north, this is I

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13222-1
01:10:50.447 --> 01:10:51.718
equal to 1 to north.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13243-0
01:10:52.018 --> 01:10:56.554
Now in this I to one to N it
will take the value only when

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13243-1
01:10:56.554 --> 01:10:58.938
DINKAR one or the same correct?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13250-0
01:11:03.748 --> 01:11:03.968
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13264-0
01:11:04.408 --> 01:11:07.948
You are differentiating WI with
respect to WK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13292-0
01:11:09.138 --> 01:11:12.860
If you get differentiate W with
respect WK, you get one only

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13283-0
01:11:10.038 --> 01:11:11.458
You know, definitely said.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13292-1
01:11:12.860 --> 01:11:14.508
when I equal to K, correct?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13306-0
01:11:15.998 --> 01:11:16.688
He should.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13322-0
01:11:17.268 --> 01:11:20.044
Otherwise you'll get a 0, so it
will have only the care to them

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13322-1
01:11:20.044 --> 01:11:20.738
which is coming.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13333-0
01:11:20.748 --> 01:11:22.888
So this will be nothing but a K,
correct?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13340-0
01:11:24.638 --> 01:11:25.058
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13358-0
01:11:26.128 --> 01:11:31.686
Now if you differentiate this
element with respect to K, will

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13358-1
01:11:31.686 --> 01:11:33.748
you not get a delta IK?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13368-0
01:11:39.368 --> 01:11:39.738
Yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13374-0
01:11:39.748 --> 01:11:41.728
If we differentiate this element
with respect to.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13409-0
01:11:45.368 --> 01:11:52.178
So for if I is not is equal to K
and if like WIK is a function.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13415-0
01:11:51.618 --> 01:11:54.628
No, no, I I and I and cake can
be the same.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13421-0
01:11:54.858 --> 01:11:56.398
Only J and I cannot be the same.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13446-0
01:11:59.958 --> 01:12:03.159
I am saying if you are
differentiating F of W with

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13437-0
01:12:00.658 --> 01:12:01.038
Turn it.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13446-1
01:12:03.159 --> 01:12:05.168
respect to WK, the WK will come.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13461-0
01:12:05.178 --> 01:12:09.490
Here it will say I will first
differentiate this keeping this

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13461-1
01:12:09.490 --> 01:12:09.908
alone.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13474-0
01:12:10.158 --> 01:12:12.928
Next, I will differentiate these
two, keeping this alone.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13480-0
01:12:13.038 --> 01:12:14.898
That is a product in the product
for correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13505-0
01:12:19.278 --> 01:12:23.205
If I differentiate WI with
respect to WK, I will get a one

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13505-1
01:12:23.205 --> 01:12:25.268
only when I equal to K correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13513-0
01:12:28.668 --> 01:12:28.938
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13535-0
01:12:30.448 --> 01:12:36.303
Only when I equal to Ki will get
the the result and if I equal to

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13535-1
01:12:36.303 --> 01:12:38.078
K, what will happen?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13541-0
01:12:38.088 --> 01:12:40.268
It will be a KJW J, right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13549-0
01:12:44.388 --> 01:12:45.658
I equal to Q correct?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13556-0
01:12:45.478 --> 01:12:45.608
K.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13559-0
01:12:45.698 --> 01:12:46.638
So that is this term.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13599-0
01:12:47.228 --> 01:12:52.100
If you come to this term, that
would be delta JK that will be

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13599-1
01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:57.209
one only when J equal to K when
J equal to K it would be WI ATIK

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13599-2
01:12:57.209 --> 01:12:59.488
so that WJJ K whatever it is.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13608-0
01:12:59.498 --> 01:13:00.548
So that'll be this term.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13623-0
01:13:01.078 --> 01:13:04.658
So you get 3 terms from DFB DWK,
correct?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13641-0
01:13:05.778 --> 01:13:09.297
So the for the first term, if I
is not is equal to K then why is

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13641-1
01:13:09.297 --> 01:13:09.568
it 0?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13650-0
01:13:11.468 --> 01:13:14.168
Are he is not equal to K?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13654-0
01:13:14.178 --> 01:13:14.738
No, no.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13661-0
01:13:14.808 --> 01:13:16.078
This has a summation MA.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13681-0
01:13:17.208 --> 01:13:22.878
It has W1 square A11W2, square
A22, and WN square AKK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13691-0
01:13:22.888 --> 01:13:24.298
That's all the terms which are
there.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13705-0
01:13:24.508 --> 01:13:27.218
So you differentiate only that
term which has a WK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13710-0
01:13:27.648 --> 01:13:29.688
Then you get 2 WK K.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13720-0
01:13:32.758 --> 01:13:34.368
OK, so you get this term.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13734-0
01:13:34.418 --> 01:13:38.697
So if you write now the
gradient, the gradient will have

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13734-1
01:13:38.697 --> 01:13:40.048
two parts correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13740-0
01:13:45.738 --> 01:13:46.158
You agree?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13757-0
01:13:47.608 --> 01:13:51.328
So does F by Dou WK will be
equal to?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13775-0
01:13:51.338 --> 01:13:57.355
Now you can combine these two
parts and then say this is equal

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13775-1
01:13:57.355 --> 01:13:59.838
to Sigma WJAJK plus Sigma.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13777-0
01:14:00.858 --> 01:14:01.258
Uh.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13785-0
01:14:02.438 --> 01:14:06.078
EKG, WJ and this is the.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13793-0
01:14:08.518 --> 01:14:10.398
This is for uh J.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13801-0
01:14:10.408 --> 01:14:12.028
Equal to 1 to N this is for.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13808-0
01:14:13.718 --> 01:14:15.698
Jay from going to him, correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13870-0
01:14:18.788 --> 01:14:22.713
What I've done is this KJ not
equal to K in that I have

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13870-1
01:14:22.713 --> 01:14:27.268
included one one term from here
WWW KKK here also have added WKK

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13870-2
01:14:27.268 --> 01:14:31.824
here also have added so you can
get this to be equal to this now

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13870-3
01:14:31.824 --> 01:14:35.398
what is this if you write it in
the expanded form.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13878-0
01:14:42.548 --> 01:14:43.938
What is this in the expanded
form?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13891-0
01:14:53.898 --> 01:14:54.978
It's confusing so.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13892-0
01:14:55.788 --> 01:14:56.138
Yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13904-0
01:14:55.958 --> 01:14:56.778
What is confusing?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13895-0
01:14:56.148 --> 01:14:57.438
How quickly?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13914-0
01:14:57.488 --> 01:14:58.898
How did we arrive to this one,
Sir?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13919-0
01:14:58.348 --> 01:14:59.968
Like we are lost in between.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13923-0
01:15:00.968 --> 01:15:02.668
This this this step is
confusing.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13940-0
01:15:04.828 --> 01:15:06.048
But in this one.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13931-0
01:15:05.128 --> 01:15:05.438
Yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13942-0
01:15:05.448 --> 01:15:07.778
Where the where the introduction
of K came.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13946-0
01:15:07.788 --> 01:15:09.008
Now we confused.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13971-0
01:15:10.608 --> 01:15:14.251
That you have written J is not
equal to K and again K is not

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13971-1
01:15:14.251 --> 01:15:14.908
equal to J.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13989-0
01:15:15.348 --> 01:15:18.535
It brought the same Baba they
they the the two indices should

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14043-0
01:15:15.858 --> 01:15:17.848
And uh-huh.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/13989-1
01:15:18.535 --> 01:15:19.358
not be the same.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14006-0
01:15:22.118 --> 01:15:24.158
So you're replacing high with
Kaiser over here?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14008-0
01:15:24.138 --> 01:15:26.458
Yeah, yeah, these are dummy
variables, not.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14019-0
01:15:30.598 --> 01:15:31.648
These are dummy variables.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14026-0
01:15:31.978 --> 01:15:33.888
I can replace anything with
anything.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14028-0
01:15:34.138 --> 01:15:34.688
It doesn't.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14046-0
01:15:34.698 --> 01:15:38.086
It doesn't matter as long as it
doesn't affect the inner ones,

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14046-1
01:15:38.086 --> 01:15:38.248
no.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14067-0
01:15:38.258 --> 01:15:41.266
Anyway, yeah, the the the
correct S of what I want to say

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14067-1
01:15:41.266 --> 01:15:42.148
is the following.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14085-0
01:15:42.198 --> 01:15:46.159
If I want to differentiate F
with respect to WK, I will get

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14085-1
01:15:46.159 --> 01:15:47.348
these three terms.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14128-0
01:15:47.758 --> 01:15:52.952
Now here, wherever J is not
equal to K, it is happening

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14128-1
01:15:52.952 --> 01:15:58.982
because when J equal to K you'll
have WJAKK right our WK AKK now

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14128-2
01:15:58.982 --> 01:16:00.188
WKKK is here.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14138-0
01:16:00.198 --> 01:16:02.808
So I put one WKK here.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14156-0
01:16:02.918 --> 01:16:06.850
Now here also if you put
K&amp;JS equal, you'll have a

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14156-1
01:16:06.850 --> 01:16:07.208
KKWK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14178-0
01:16:07.258 --> 01:16:12.678
So I put one KKKWK here so that
I can make K&amp;J to be equal

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14178-1
01:16:12.678 --> 01:16:13.108
also.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14194-0
01:16:13.158 --> 01:16:15.935
So I will say K also one to
north and K goes from one to

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14194-1
01:16:15.935 --> 01:16:16.228
north.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14208-0
01:16:16.498 --> 01:16:19.188
If you do the transformation you
will get something like this.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14250-0
01:16:19.638 --> 01:16:23.747
Now this with little bit of
algebra you will be able to

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14250-1
01:16:23.747 --> 01:16:28.076
prove this is nothing but a
transpose times W plus Aw this

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14250-2
01:16:28.076 --> 01:16:31.818
is nothing but air transpose
plus A times Gabriel.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14265-0
01:16:32.628 --> 01:16:38.016
So if you have F2B, uh, this is
a this is actually the the

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14265-1
01:16:38.016 --> 01:16:38.838
gradient.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14279-0
01:16:43.708 --> 01:16:47.108
18th of so the gradient of F.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14286-0
01:16:49.228 --> 01:16:50.168
If you have equal to.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14307-0
01:16:51.608 --> 01:16:57.324
W transpose AW then the gradient
of F is nothing but a transpose

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14307-1
01:16:57.324 --> 01:16:58.468
plus A times.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14314-0
01:16:59.378 --> 01:17:00.608
Have you now?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14348-0
01:17:00.618 --> 01:17:04.740
This is one of the important
results now if yeah you

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14348-1
01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:09.330
symmetric then gradient of F is
nothing but 28 W because A

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14348-2
01:17:09.330 --> 01:17:11.508
transpose will become eight.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14361-0
01:17:11.518 --> 01:17:13.588
So it'll become 22AW OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14367-0
01:17:22.178 --> 01:17:22.638
He said OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14388-0
01:17:28.208 --> 01:17:31.398
Say last fourth line, we don't
be able to understand this.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14385-0
01:17:31.958 --> 01:17:32.928
Which line you tell me?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14402-0
01:17:32.938 --> 01:17:36.538
I will just do this stuff. What?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14393-0
01:17:33.958 --> 01:17:34.198
Phone.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14426-0
01:17:36.568 --> 01:17:42.731
Ohh, this Sigma F upon no Sigma
WK equals to where we previously

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14426-1
01:17:42.731 --> 01:17:46.618
we are getting three no
component right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14434-0
01:17:46.868 --> 01:17:48.128
How it reduced to two?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14433-0
01:17:47.088 --> 01:17:47.868
Ohh.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14447-0
01:17:50.828 --> 01:17:52.378
A job that is the problem.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14455-0
01:17:52.768 --> 01:17:54.608
OK, everything.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14466-0
01:17:53.898 --> 01:17:57.059
And how can product of two terms
can become sum of two terms

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14466-1
01:17:57.059 --> 01:17:57.318
here?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14486-0
01:17:58.268 --> 01:18:02.132
Hey this is because of product
rule might tell you and spend a

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14486-1
01:18:02.132 --> 01:18:05.690
little more time here, but OK,
so you have something like

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14486-2
01:18:05.690 --> 01:18:06.058
Sigma.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14516-0
01:18:07.978 --> 01:18:14.837
J not equal to I, J equal to 1
to NI equal to 1 to N what is

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14516-1
01:18:14.837 --> 01:18:17.648
the terminology used Raj?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14529-0
01:18:17.658 --> 01:18:21.998
Because I don't want to confuse
you with W Jain JWJ.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14532-0
01:18:24.788 --> 01:18:25.238
Umm.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14538-0
01:18:26.108 --> 01:18:29.778
WAIJ something like correct?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14552-0
01:18:31.848 --> 01:18:32.288
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14545-0
01:18:31.878 --> 01:18:32.218
Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14547-0
01:18:32.318 --> 01:18:32.588
Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14568-0
01:18:32.598 --> 01:18:36.748
What you have written, Jay, is
not equal to I then.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14558-0
01:18:34.058 --> 01:18:34.158
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14569-0
01:18:36.508 --> 01:18:37.778
Not the is not equal to him.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14581-0
01:18:37.788 --> 01:18:39.598
I'm saying J is not equal to I.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14591-0
01:18:40.108 --> 01:18:42.198
If you expand this, yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14590-0
01:18:40.148 --> 01:18:41.258
That I jade not equal.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14613-0
01:18:42.208 --> 01:18:45.798
If you expand this product, let
me expand this product with

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14613-1
01:18:45.798 --> 01:18:49.448
respect to I now what is the
first value of I will you give?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14620-0
01:18:51.808 --> 01:18:51.958
But.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14628-0
01:18:52.718 --> 01:18:53.128
1.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14645-0
01:18:52.838 --> 01:18:59.277
One so this will be equal to W
one times the J loop will now

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14629-0
01:18:53.018 --> 01:18:53.258
1.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14645-1
01:18:59.277 --> 01:19:02.128
start, J can be equal to 1.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14690-0
01:19:04.568 --> 01:19:09.018
No, it cannot be right and this
go.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14661-0
01:19:05.688 --> 01:19:06.338
It cannot be equal.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14674-0
01:19:06.348 --> 01:19:07.648
So what is the starting point of
J?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14677-0
01:19:08.298 --> 01:19:08.528
2.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14694-0
01:19:09.108 --> 01:19:09.748
212.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14688-0
01:19:09.408 --> 01:19:09.758
No.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14693-0
01:19:09.448 --> 01:19:09.778
Good.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14720-0
01:19:09.928 --> 01:19:18.153
So this will be a 12 W 2 plus
A13W3 plus all the way up to A1

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14720-1
01:19:18.153 --> 01:19:19.878
NWN, correct?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14727-0
01:19:21.468 --> 01:19:21.918
But it's so.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14723-0
01:19:21.628 --> 01:19:21.738
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14731-0
01:19:22.138 --> 01:19:22.598
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14729-0
01:19:22.978 --> 01:19:23.368
No.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14750-0
01:19:23.378 --> 01:19:28.352
Then now you start I equal to
two, so I say W2 Now can JB

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14750-1
01:19:28.352 --> 01:19:29.638
equal to 1 now?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14755-0
01:19:30.888 --> 01:19:31.028
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14758-0
01:19:31.448 --> 01:19:31.648
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14760-0
01:19:31.658 --> 01:19:31.798
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14756-0
01:19:31.808 --> 01:19:32.398
Yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14773-0
01:19:32.468 --> 01:19:37.678
So yeah, 21 W 1 plus can J B2.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14775-0
01:19:38.748 --> 01:19:38.948
No.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14783-0
01:19:39.498 --> 01:19:39.688
No.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14781-0
01:19:39.918 --> 01:19:40.338
No.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14801-0
01:19:39.918 --> 01:19:45.877
So this is, yeah, 13 W 3 plus
all the way up to A1 NWN,

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14790-0
01:19:41.578 --> 01:19:41.718
No.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14801-1
01:19:45.877 --> 01:19:46.728
correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14808-0
01:19:47.758 --> 01:19:47.968
Right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14815-0
01:19:47.968 --> 01:19:48.088
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14818-0
01:19:48.058 --> 01:19:49.428
So 2333.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14819-0
01:19:49.068 --> 01:19:49.408
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14821-0
01:19:50.778 --> 01:19:51.188
Uh, sorry.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14830-0
01:19:54.768 --> 01:19:56.858

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14841-0
01:19:59.098 --> 01:20:00.838
Yes, that's me the last.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14843-0
01:19:59.318 --> 01:19:59.578

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14867-0
01:20:05.168 --> 01:20:06.768
Then WN will come then.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14886-0

And one double W have you OK?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14899-0
01:20:08.628 --> 01:20:11.448
And one then W.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14897-0
01:20:08.938 --> 01:20:09.938
In in one.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14929-0
01:20:09.738 --> 01:20:19.108

2A N n -, 1, W.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14908-0

Here and minus one.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14927-0
01:20:16.178 --> 01:20:16.908

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14944-0
01:20:20.178 --> 01:20:20.888
In minus one.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14949-0
01:20:20.898 --> 01:20:21.518

Not now.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14997-0
01:20:25.108 --> 01:20:29.835
The question is if I
differentiate this with respect

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14997-1
01:20:29.835 --> 01:20:35.633
to WK, can we do arbitrary sense
or I will take a simple example

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/14997-2
01:20:35.633 --> 01:20:37.328
and explain to you?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15021-0
01:20:38.028 --> 01:20:39.188
Take a small example, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15020-0

01:20:39.408 --> 01:20:41.518
OK, suppose I want to so this.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15038-0
01:20:41.528 --> 01:20:48.222
If I say D by DW2 of this
expression, I call this

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15038-1
01:20:48.222 --> 01:20:50.498
expression as ex.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15046-0
01:20:51.618 --> 01:20:53.188

01:20:53.738 --> 01:20:55.468
Now, what are the contributions
going to get?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15065-0
01:20:56.918 --> 01:20:58.638
You will get one contribution
from here.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15074-0
01:20:59.748 --> 01:20:59.988

But like I said.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15107-0
01:21:00.708 --> 01:21:07.005
There is W2, it will happen only
in one term, so you'll get W1A12

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15095-0
01:21:02.438 --> 01:21:04.678

Yes, you will get one
contribution from here.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15138-0
01:21:16.378 --> 01:21:17.088
What is that?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15149-0
01:21:16.528 --> 01:21:19.408

01:21:27.578 --> 01:21:27.718
This.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15169-0
01:21:27.848 --> 01:21:28.958

And through W.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15211-0
01:21:35.548 --> 01:21:39.566
In in, in, in, in, in, in in the
the third one you'll also get

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15205-0
01:21:35.818 --> 01:21:37.218
WNBA N 2.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15211-1
01:21:39.566 --> 01:21:39.758
W3.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15222-0
01:21:39.768 --> 01:21:42.458
You will get if you put W3 what
is inside.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15241-0
01:21:45.108 --> 01:21:50.778
Yeah, 31 W 1 plus A32W2 plus all

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15243-0
01:21:50.788 --> 01:21:51.018
Right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15260-0
01:21:52.408 --> 01:21:56.048
So will you not get something
from here W3A32.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15269-0
01:21:55.118 --> 01:21:57.738
The book context.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15272-0
01:21:57.128 --> 01:21:57.328

01:21:59.008 --> 01:22:02.188
832 will you not get W4A42?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15297-0
01:22:02.788 --> 01:22:02.988
Yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15300-0

Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15320-0
01:22:04.078 --> 01:22:08.878
That's all the day Abdul W NA4A.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15326-0

01:22:11.928 --> 01:22:14.488
And he did not get all these
things.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15341-0
01:22:15.668 --> 01:22:15.948
Yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15344-0
01:22:15.958 --> 01:22:16.148
Yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15355-0
01:22:16.158 --> 01:22:16.758
And too, yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15359-0
01:22:17.048 --> 01:22:17.448
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15357-0
01:22:17.258 --> 01:22:17.968
So.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15366-0
01:22:18.178 --> 01:22:20.588
So the point is, how many terms
are here?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15374-0
01:22:20.818 --> 01:22:22.748
This is a one this is.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15378-0
01:22:22.958 --> 01:22:23.648
This is here.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15382-0
01:22:23.658 --> 01:22:24.348
This is here.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15386-0
01:22:24.358 --> 01:22:24.968
This is here.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15396-0
01:22:24.978 --> 01:22:28.768
This is here you get all terms
where you have.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15403-0
01:22:31.408 --> 01:22:32.268
These two, right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15417-0
01:22:34.958 --> 01:22:39.048
WJAJK at and a KJW J.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15419-0
01:22:39.808 --> 01:22:40.488
You're getting it now.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15434-0
01:22:42.858 --> 01:22:43.088
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15430-0
01:22:42.998 --> 01:22:43.118
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15438-0
01:22:43.698 --> 01:22:44.488
Quarter, yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15452-0
01:22:44.488 --> 01:22:49.294
You got this term and this term,
so you will get all these terms

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15452-1
01:22:49.294 --> 01:22:49.738
there.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15488-0
01:22:50.708 --> 01:22:54.834
You put all these terms so you
can put one where J is not equal

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15488-1
01:22:54.834 --> 01:22:58.638
to K you see A22 will not be
there at all in either of the

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15488-2
01:22:58.638 --> 01:22:59.928
expansions, correct?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15529-0
01:23:02.868 --> 01:23:06.045
A2 to term will not be there at
all in both the expansions, but

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15529-1
01:23:06.045 --> 01:23:08.973
the A2 to term will come in this
first term, which we have

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15529-2
01:23:08.973 --> 01:23:11.108
already agreed upon, which is
nothing but.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15582-0
01:23:13.328 --> 01:23:18.504
2 WKKK so I am going to lend 1
WKKK to the first one and one WK

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15582-1
01:23:18.504 --> 01:23:23.762
to the second one, so I will get
a + A transpose plus OK, and if

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15580-0
01:23:23.678 --> 01:23:24.138
Ohh.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15582-2
01:23:23.762 --> 01:23:25.218
you if you if you.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15602-0
01:23:25.228 --> 01:23:29.338
If you say a symmetric then you
will get this to be 2 * A and

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15602-1
01:23:29.338 --> 01:23:30.068
times W OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15609-0
01:23:34.428 --> 01:23:34.818
Got it.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15618-0
01:23:34.828 --> 01:23:35.408
So thank you.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15619-0
01:23:35.388 --> 01:23:36.178
OK, fine.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15622-0
01:23:36.648 --> 01:23:37.958
Just request some algebra.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15639-0
01:23:38.348 --> 01:23:41.738
OK, so I am going to tell you
what these things is, gradients

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15639-1
01:23:41.738 --> 01:23:42.668
and other things.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15663-0
01:23:44.468 --> 01:23:49.796
Now if you take F of X to be X
Now A is going to be something

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15663-1
01:23:49.796 --> 01:23:50.398
like a.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15670-0
01:23:50.408 --> 01:23:52.108
You won't have a small paper
with you.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15684-0
01:23:54.108 --> 01:23:55.628
Can we do a small?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15683-0
01:23:54.588 --> 01:23:54.738
To.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15691-0
01:23:55.688 --> 01:23:56.308
You should.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15698-0
01:23:55.788 --> 01:23:58.178
Because I would explain
something on tensors to you.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15703-0
01:23:59.118 --> 01:23:59.518
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15713-0
01:23:59.348 --> 01:24:04.925
So can you can you all have
three small pieces of paper of

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15713-1
01:24:04.925 --> 01:24:06.248
the same size?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15718-0
01:24:10.248 --> 01:24:10.598
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15725-0
01:24:11.368 --> 01:24:13.878
Three small pieces of paper of
the same size.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15730-0
01:24:24.118 --> 01:24:24.288
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15736-0
01:24:25.708 --> 01:24:26.018
Hmm.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15746-0
01:24:26.758 --> 01:24:30.248
OK, so now I'm going to have F
of X equal to X.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15781-0
01:24:30.718 --> 01:24:39.548
Now A is nothing but
2X1X23X2X34X1X31X2X34X1X37X1X2.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15799-0
01:24:39.918 --> 01:24:43.008
Now we want to find the gradient
of F with respect to this Excel.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15811-0
01:24:43.808 --> 01:24:46.898
Now what is the gradient of
here?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15825-0
01:24:46.908 --> 01:24:49.488
This is the gradient of this
matrix with respect to this.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15840-0
01:24:49.698 --> 01:24:52.068
Now A is a function of X1 X 2X3.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15857-0
01:24:52.378 --> 01:24:55.980
So in the 1st paper you have
done by Dou X1, it'll be one

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15857-1
01:24:55.980 --> 01:24:56.788
matrix right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15869-0
01:25:00.158 --> 01:25:00.618
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15886-0
01:25:01.388 --> 01:25:05.904
So if we go to do exercise again
a matrix 2F by 2X3 is again a

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15886-1
01:25:05.904 --> 01:25:06.908
matrix, right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15899-0
01:25:09.088 --> 01:25:09.538
Excellent.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15911-0
01:25:09.978 --> 01:25:14.068
Now what you do is you put in
the first sheet of paper.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15903-0
01:25:10.298 --> 01:25:10.738
You see.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15963-0
01:25:14.258 --> 01:25:18.094
Though if we do X1 in the next
day sheet of paper, you put the

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15963-1
01:25:18.094 --> 01:25:22.114
the do FX-2 in the next sheet of
paper you put the dot FST dot X3

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15963-2
01:25:22.114 --> 01:25:24.428
and you staple all the them
together.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15968-0
01:25:24.438 --> 01:25:25.658
That is gradient X OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15974-0
01:25:37.828 --> 01:25:38.068
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15986-0
01:25:40.608 --> 01:25:41.068
OK, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15989-0
01:25:40.738 --> 01:25:41.318
He should.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15990-0
01:25:41.568 --> 01:25:42.368
Need one minute, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/15992-0
01:25:42.018 --> 01:25:42.838
OK, fine.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16008-0
01:25:44.118 --> 01:25:47.448
So I'm going to explain to you
here what it actually means.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16006-0
01:25:45.238 --> 01:25:45.398
No.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16015-0
01:25:47.878 --> 01:25:49.258
Maybe I should put it into?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16031-0
01:25:51.428 --> 01:25:52.978
So just a quick question.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16029-0
01:25:52.228 --> 01:25:52.408
Yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16050-0
01:25:53.078 --> 01:25:56.958
So X1, X 2X3 are the dimensions
right 123.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16042-0
01:25:56.388 --> 01:25:57.018
No damage.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16054-0
01:25:57.028 --> 01:25:59.388
X2X2X3 are the parameters in the
game.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16074-0
01:26:02.468 --> 01:26:05.570
That is the input parameter, so
I will explain now here what I

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16074-1
01:26:05.570 --> 01:26:06.358
asked you to do.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16087-0
01:26:06.368 --> 01:26:07.758
I am going to explain to you
now.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16097-0
01:26:08.328 --> 01:26:11.558
You took an A which is 4 + 2 for
example.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16113-0
01:26:11.568 --> 01:26:16.478
OK, A is a 4 + 2 matrix and X is
an R3.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16149-0
01:26:16.548 --> 01:26:21.590
So which has three components
X1, X, 2X3 and A has all the

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16149-1
01:26:21.590 --> 01:26:26.719
elements, uh, four into 28
elements, which are functions of

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16149-2
01:26:26.719 --> 01:26:27.488
X1 X 2X3.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16178-0
01:26:27.728 --> 01:26:31.493
So to find the partial
derivative, what you do is you

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16178-1
01:26:31.493 --> 01:26:35.886
take the 1st paper, you divide
it horizontally into four parts

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16178-2
01:26:35.886 --> 01:26:37.978
and vertically into two parts.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16199-0
01:26:38.408 --> 01:26:41.362
You write down a by Dou X1, so
you differentiate each of the

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16199-1
01:26:41.362 --> 01:26:42.718
elements with respect to X1.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16204-0
01:26:43.068 --> 01:26:44.458
Keep that paper separately.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16219-0
01:26:44.888 --> 01:26:47.318
Take the 2nd paper, find doable
doax 2.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16231-0
01:26:47.728 --> 01:26:50.408
Take the 3rd paper and find do
AB dot X3.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16241-0
01:26:51.508 --> 01:26:53.858
Put one on top of each other and
staple them.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16251-0
01:26:54.328 --> 01:26:55.408
You will get something like
this.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16255-0
01:26:56.478 --> 01:26:57.298
You're able to get it.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16260-0
01:26:59.898 --> 01:27:00.258
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16271-0
01:27:01.508 --> 01:27:01.888
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16288-0
01:27:02.168 --> 01:27:05.655
The same thing can be done
little the car in a in a

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16288-1
01:27:05.655 --> 01:27:07.198
slightly if you're you.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16304-0
01:27:07.208 --> 01:27:10.440
If you're used to working in one
dimensional arrays, it's again

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16304-1
01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:11.198
OK, no problem.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16331-0
01:27:11.728 --> 01:27:16.498
You take the A once this A is
here you take the second column

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16331-1
01:27:16.498 --> 01:27:20.038
of A and pad it to the first
column of a. OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16347-0
01:27:24.778 --> 01:27:25.358
OK, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16359-0
01:27:25.078 --> 01:27:27.318
The 8 by 1 then OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16354-0
01:27:26.078 --> 01:27:28.128
But yeah, it is 8 by 1.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16356-0
01:27:28.138 --> 01:27:28.588
Perfect.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16373-0
01:27:28.778 --> 01:27:31.958
So you take the second column
and pad it to the first column.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16401-0
01:27:33.298 --> 01:27:37.263
Now then, if you find Doyle by
Dou X, the first column is

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16401-1
01:27:37.263 --> 01:27:41.229
basically nothing, but you
differentiate all the elements

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16401-2
01:27:41.229 --> 01:27:42.528
with respect to X1.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16415-0
01:27:42.998 --> 01:27:46.011
The second column is nothing but
all the elements with respect to

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16415-1
01:27:46.011 --> 01:27:46.148
X2.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16426-0
01:27:46.218 --> 01:27:49.108
3rd element is all the elements
with respect to X3.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16433-0
01:27:49.618 --> 01:27:50.988
Now you can regroup.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16497-0
01:27:51.038 --> 01:27:53.852
What you do is you take the
first column half of the

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16497-1
01:27:53.852 --> 01:27:57.090
elements and 1st column, second
half of the elements in pair

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16497-2
01:27:57.090 --> 01:28:00.382
them, second column first to
four elements and 2nd 4 elements

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16497-3
01:28:00.382 --> 01:28:03.355
is the second page, 3rd row,
third column first for the

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16497-4
01:28:03.355 --> 01:28:06.541
second column in the third one,
and then you group them and

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16497-5
01:28:06.541 --> 01:28:07.178
staple them.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16506-0
01:28:07.188 --> 01:28:08.868
Both of them have the same
answer, OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16510-0
01:28:14.028 --> 01:28:14.508
Got it.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16559-0
01:28:16.648 --> 01:28:20.599
Yep, B it will tend to the same
result right from on the left

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16522-0
01:28:16.708 --> 01:28:16.908
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16547-0
01:28:19.228 --> 01:28:21.758
Exactly thought 10 days, they're
exactly the same.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16559-1
01:28:20.599 --> 01:28:22.638
side and the right side. Gotcha.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16554-0
01:28:22.008 --> 01:28:23.538
It is how you represent it.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16566-0
01:28:23.548 --> 01:28:25.898
See for example in computer
implementation.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16613-0
01:28:26.208 --> 01:28:29.488
You might be very fast with the
column vector or row vector

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16613-1
01:28:29.488 --> 01:28:32.769
computation, so you do this
single array business if you if

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16589-0
01:28:30.488 --> 01:28:30.648
Umm.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16613-2
01:28:32.769 --> 01:28:36.268
you're used to multiple arrays,
then you can use this approach.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16606-0
01:28:32.918 --> 01:28:33.378
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16625-0
01:28:39.178 --> 01:28:39.478
Speaker.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16628-0
01:28:40.278 --> 01:28:42.148
There's no gradients of
matrices.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16631-0
01:28:40.638 --> 01:28:40.948
Right here.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16662-0
01:28:42.158 --> 01:28:46.166
Is the partial derivatives with
respect to the parameters

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16650-0
01:28:46.018 --> 01:28:46.628
Exactly.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16662-1
01:28:46.166 --> 01:28:47.618
separated by a comma.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16660-0
01:28:46.788 --> 01:28:47.098
Right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16655-0
01:28:47.058 --> 01:28:47.958
Exactly, exactly.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16666-0
01:28:47.968 --> 01:28:49.058
This is a gradient of matrices.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16668-0
01:28:50.708 --> 01:28:51.178
OK, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16680-0
01:28:51.928 --> 01:28:55.598
OK, now this is something which
I did.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16699-0
01:28:56.308 --> 01:29:00.547
Uh, so this will be a tensor of
the order 4, cross 2 cross

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16699-1
01:29:00.547 --> 01:29:00.978
three.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16709-0
01:29:01.568 --> 01:29:03.818
Now this is 4 cross 2 cross
three.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16725-0
01:29:03.888 --> 01:29:06.498
That's what you get if you
differentiate the right and say.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16767-0
01:29:06.508 --> 01:29:09.708
Now typically what you need to
see is if you are

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16767-1
01:29:09.708 --> 01:29:13.823
differentiating the input the
output with respect to the input

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16767-2
01:29:13.823 --> 01:29:17.546
you take the dimension of the
output, multiply it by the

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16767-3
01:29:17.546 --> 01:29:19.048
dimension of the input.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16774-0
01:29:19.058 --> 01:29:20.558
That will be the dimension of
the tensor.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16780-0
01:29:20.828 --> 01:29:21.958
Now, what is a X?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16786-0
01:29:21.968 --> 01:29:22.978
What is the dimension of this?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16792-0
01:29:25.638 --> 01:29:25.968
Of three.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16807-0
01:29:27.198 --> 01:29:30.758
2 Cross Three and what is a
dimension of the input?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16805-0
01:29:29.378 --> 01:29:29.658
Correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16809-0
01:29:32.318 --> 01:29:32.558

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16844-0
01:29:33.478 --> 01:29:36.132
So it is 2 cross three cross 3
dimensions of the output times

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16844-1
01:29:36.132 --> 01:29:38.658
dimensions of the input that is
2 cross three cross three.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16840-0
01:29:37.068 --> 01:29:37.538
Perfect.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16848-0
01:29:39.448 --> 01:29:41.068
Now, for example, what is
output?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16852-0
01:29:44.398 --> 01:29:45.078
Four, crush 2.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16869-0
01:29:47.198 --> 01:29:48.648
For trust two, what is the
input?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16870-0
01:29:47.328 --> 01:29:48.568
Workers 2 + 3.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16887-0
01:29:49.568 --> 01:29:53.398

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16884-0
01:29:50.618 --> 01:29:52.548
So it is 4 + 2 + 3 correct?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16896-0
01:29:53.168 --> 01:29:53.368
Yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16897-0
01:29:53.628 --> 01:29:53.888
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16907-0
01:29:54.218 --> 01:29:58.041
So there will be 4 rows, 2
columns and three papers,

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16899-0
01:29:54.368 --> 01:29:54.608
Good.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16907-1
01:29:58.041 --> 01:29:58.618
correct?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16910-0
01:29:59.098 --> 01:29:59.398
Right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16925-0
01:30:00.548 --> 01:30:04.538
In fair enough, now you tell me
FFF equal to X.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16937-0
01:30:04.868 --> 01:30:07.598
Now ASRM cross north in X is RN.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16943-0
01:30:07.608 --> 01:30:08.308
So what is the input?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/16952-0
01:30:10.158 --> 01:30:11.228

The output dimension?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17137-0
01:30:58.358 --> 01:30:59.028
M + 1.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17150-0
01:30:59.278 --> 01:31:03.568
No, yam is the output cross M
cross and the FA equal to X.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17155-0
01:31:03.578 --> 01:31:04.578
That is a function, right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17166-0
01:31:09.428 --> 01:31:11.378
So it is M cross M cross N OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17182-0
01:31:13.318 --> 01:31:15.248
The Sir, could you please
repeat, Sir, I'm sorry.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17199-0
01:31:15.508 --> 01:31:18.718
I'm saying if you wanna
differentiate this function with

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17199-1
01:31:18.718 --> 01:31:21.028
respect to a, is a parameter
right here.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17208-0
01:31:21.948 --> 01:31:22.228
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17227-0
01:31:22.838 --> 01:31:26.216
So hey, is of the order of M
cross N what is the output

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17225-0
01:31:26.158 --> 01:31:26.288
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17227-1
01:31:26.216 --> 01:31:28.388
output output is of the order of
M.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17271-0
01:31:30.288 --> 01:31:33.904
If you multiply A and X, uh RM
crossing the road, so this is

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17250-0
01:31:32.578 --> 01:31:33.038
OK. Yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17271-1
01:31:33.904 --> 01:31:37.580
the the the, the, the, the the
Gray gradient is nothing but M

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17263-0
01:31:34.488 --> 01:31:35.088
Yeah, cross one.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17271-2
01:31:37.580 --> 01:31:38.588
cross M crossing.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17278-0
01:31:38.598 --> 01:31:39.878
That's a gradient.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17291-0
01:31:41.198 --> 01:31:43.998
OK, now how do you how do you
calculate the?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17293-0
01:31:42.008 --> 01:31:42.928
Right, right, right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17290-0
01:31:42.078 --> 01:31:42.288
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17307-0
01:31:44.008 --> 01:31:46.876
There is the gradient of a
function with respect to a

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17307-1
01:31:46.876 --> 01:31:47.248
matrix.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17324-0
01:31:47.598 --> 01:31:50.546
You take each of the components
of the function and you

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17324-1
01:31:50.546 --> 01:31:52.758
differentiate with respect to
the matrix.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17348-0
01:31:54.098 --> 01:31:57.887
Now DFI by DA will belong to R1
Cross M Cross North because each

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17348-1
01:31:57.887 --> 01:31:59.578
one is a scalar here correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17355-0
01:32:01.428 --> 01:32:01.748
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17368-0
01:32:02.238 --> 01:32:03.038
OK, fine.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17377-0
01:32:04.078 --> 01:32:07.668
That for one question on that,
if we can go back, no.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17381-0
01:32:04.488 --> 01:32:06.328
Now, yeah, yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17417-0
01:32:07.718 --> 01:32:11.786
So in the earlier slide, we were
seeing if a is of four cross two

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17417-1
01:32:11.786 --> 01:32:15.855
and X is of you know three, then
it is a four cross 2 cross three

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17417-2
01:32:15.855 --> 01:32:17.088
is the output right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17422-0
01:32:17.228 --> 01:32:17.428
Yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17451-0
01:32:18.258 --> 01:32:23.072
So but here we are probably
demonstrating it differently,

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17451-1
01:32:23.072 --> 01:32:28.218
like a is of let's say 4 cross
2X's of, you know 3 dimension.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17453-0
01:32:28.618 --> 01:32:29.268
Not no, no.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17468-0
01:32:29.478 --> 01:32:35.523
The point is, the last in the
last example X was the input

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17468-1
01:32:35.523 --> 01:32:36.548
parameter.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17476-0
01:32:36.558 --> 01:32:37.838
Here A is the input parameter.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17492-0
01:32:39.148 --> 01:32:40.238
Output is X.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17497-0
01:32:40.648 --> 01:32:43.248
How could his eggs if you give a
it'll give eggs.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17500-0
01:32:46.118 --> 01:32:46.358
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17508-0
01:32:47.558 --> 01:32:49.628
OK, so that's the difference
between those two.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17530-0
01:32:50.118 --> 01:32:55.689
OK, so now if you want to say X,
how does a X will will will

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17530-1
01:32:55.689 --> 01:32:56.328
behave?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17550-0
01:32:56.718 --> 01:33:01.375
You can write a X as you take
first row of A and then multiply

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17550-1
01:33:01.375 --> 01:33:02.928
it with the X column.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17555-0
01:33:03.278 --> 01:33:04.738
2nd row of A et cetera.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17571-0
01:33:04.748 --> 01:33:08.097
So if you see the iith row, it
will be nothing but ARIJIT,

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17571-1
01:33:08.097 --> 01:33:08.438
right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17577-0
01:33:15.678 --> 01:33:15.798
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17596-0
01:33:16.958 --> 01:33:20.964
So this is a J, so J equal to 1
to north for I equal to 1 to

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17596-1
01:33:20.964 --> 01:33:21.358
north.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17628-0
01:33:21.878 --> 01:33:27.861
If you take the partial
differential with respect to

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17628-1
01:33:27.861 --> 01:33:32.828
SHAIQ now you see it will have a
11A12A13A.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17656-0
01:33:33.018 --> 01:33:40.748
But if I take I equal to 1,
it'll have a I-1A1JA11A12A13A14.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17672-0
01:33:40.758 --> 01:33:44.927
All these terms will be there if
I differentiate I with respect

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17672-1
01:33:44.927 --> 01:33:45.318
to IQ.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17690-0
01:33:46.368 --> 01:33:50.449
I told you that this will have
now only one thing, but when

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17690-1
01:33:50.449 --> 01:33:51.878
will have some value.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17711-0
01:33:57.178 --> 01:33:58.358
When Q equal to Israel?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17703-0
01:33:59.008 --> 01:33:59.218
Yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17723-0
01:33:59.228 --> 01:34:01.780
I mean Q equal to I only it will
have a value otherwise it will

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17723-1
01:34:01.780 --> 01:34:02.538
not have any value.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17740-0
01:34:02.948 --> 01:34:05.058
Yeah, at that time you will get
only an X cube, correct?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17752-0
01:34:12.218 --> 01:34:13.368
Can you repeat that, Sir,
please?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17750-0
01:34:13.718 --> 01:34:14.368
Yeah, sure.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17765-0
01:34:14.658 --> 01:34:18.068
You see, if you have FIE equal
to a IJ XJ.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17796-0
01:34:18.978 --> 01:34:24.410
Now if I want to differentiate
this with respect to SHAIQ only,

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17796-1
01:34:24.410 --> 01:34:29.418
the QT term will get a one,
otherwise it will be 0, right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17803-0
01:34:30.728 --> 01:34:31.128
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17820-0
01:34:32.098 --> 01:34:35.866
So in the acute down will be
executed only because it'll be

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17820-1
01:34:35.866 --> 01:34:36.808
IQ XQ, correct?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17827-0
01:34:38.788 --> 01:34:39.268
Got it.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17829-0
01:34:39.208 --> 01:34:39.928
Right, right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17831-0
01:34:40.048 --> 01:34:40.818
OK, fine.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17841-0
01:34:41.308 --> 01:34:43.478
Now I will show you will get an
excuse there.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17854-0
01:34:43.528 --> 01:34:45.658
So the 8th row element will
become.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17866-0
01:34:45.698 --> 01:34:48.327
You know you differentiate
everything with respect to all

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17866-1
01:34:48.327 --> 01:34:49.098
these parameters.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17878-0
01:34:49.108 --> 01:34:51.028
You will get X1 X 2X3.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17885-0
01:34:51.038 --> 01:34:52.968
Up to this it will be X
transpose.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17898-0
01:34:54.478 --> 01:34:57.968
Now do FI by Dou IK will be a
zero.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17900-0
01:34:58.038 --> 01:34:58.338
Why?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17910-0
01:34:58.348 --> 01:35:00.538
Because it will not have
anything in common, correct?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17926-0
01:35:05.618 --> 01:35:06.968
I cannot equal strike.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17928-0
01:35:05.648 --> 01:35:09.018
Then K is not equal to K, not
equal to i.e.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17950-0
01:35:09.028 --> 01:35:12.697
They will not have anything in
comments if it is 0, so does FYI

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17950-1
01:35:12.697 --> 01:35:13.098
by Dou.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17965-0
01:35:13.108 --> 01:35:18.178
A K will be 0, transpose 0,
transpose X, transpose 0000.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/17975-0
01:35:18.568 --> 01:35:21.008
So this will be R1 cross M
cross.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18021-0
01:35:21.018 --> 01:35:24.850
Yeah, OK, this is all not that
thing and this is something

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18021-1
01:35:24.850 --> 01:35:28.877
which somebody asked me if you
have an end dimensional vector

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18021-2
01:35:28.877 --> 01:35:32.385
and you have a K dimensional
vector, you can take the

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18021-3
01:35:32.385 --> 01:35:35.178
gradient of one with respect to
the other.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18034-0
01:35:35.628 --> 01:35:38.108
You generally get something
called as a Jacobian.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18046-0
01:35:38.118 --> 01:35:41.298
The Jacobian can be also matrix
with respect to another matrix.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18084-0
01:35:42.168 --> 01:35:45.816
Now don't think that you can
differentiate A3 by three matrix

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18084-1
01:35:45.816 --> 01:35:49.406
with a three by three matrix
only you can differentiate an M

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18084-2
01:35:49.406 --> 01:35:52.348
cross N matrix with the P cross
Q matrix also OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18115-0
01:35:54.408 --> 01:35:58.201
This will give a more
complicated tensor structure

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18115-1
01:35:58.201 --> 01:36:02.663
which is nothing but a Vijay BKL
which is the Jacobian IJKL

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18115-2
01:36:02.663 --> 01:36:03.258
element.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18126-0
01:36:03.708 --> 01:36:05.698
Now this depends upon a lot of
things.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18148-0
01:36:06.048 --> 01:36:12.328
I can be equal to KJ can be
equal to L or I, J can be equal

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18148-1
01:36:12.328 --> 01:36:13.898
to KL etcetera.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18161-0
01:36:14.008 --> 01:36:17.005
So this there are few conditions
where we have written all those

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18161-1
01:36:17.005 --> 01:36:17.328
things.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18171-0
01:36:18.548 --> 01:36:20.948
There is one simple example
which you have given here.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18199-0
01:36:21.868 --> 01:36:27.588
B is in RM crossing and FB is in
M cross N to N cross N Now what

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18199-1
01:36:27.588 --> 01:36:30.228
is B transpose BBR M crossing?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18204-0
01:36:30.238 --> 01:36:31.388
What is B transpose B?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18214-0
01:36:37.268 --> 01:36:38.738
He's him crossing matrix.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18227-0
01:36:38.748 --> 01:36:40.258
Ma, what is B transpose B?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18226-0
01:36:39.458 --> 01:36:39.768
Color.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18235-0
01:36:41.348 --> 01:36:41.938
In crossing.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18236-0
01:36:42.338 --> 01:36:43.548
And crossing matrix?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18240-0
01:36:42.668 --> 01:36:42.828
And.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18242-0
01:36:43.558 --> 01:36:44.748
Uh, what is output?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18247-0
01:36:44.758 --> 01:36:45.988
Output is N crossing.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18253-0
01:36:45.998 --> 01:36:47.308
What is the input B?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18275-0
01:36:47.318 --> 01:36:51.844
Is M cross N so the gradient
will be some tensor in N cross N

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18275-1
01:36:51.844 --> 01:36:55.568
cross cross M crossing correct
output cross input.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18279-0
01:36:59.448 --> 01:36:59.748
Is.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18298-0
01:37:01.368 --> 01:37:07.975
Now we can ask her what is dog
KP QPQ element with respect to

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18298-1
01:37:07.975 --> 01:37:08.188
B?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18308-0
01:37:08.918 --> 01:37:11.948
Now, what is the PQ element of
K?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18317-0
01:37:12.198 --> 01:37:13.428
You can calculate right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18331-0
01:37:13.818 --> 01:37:18.718
How do you find the PQ element
of of the product?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18350-0
01:37:19.288 --> 01:37:23.577
You take the Piet element P at
row of V transpose and multiply

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18350-1
01:37:23.577 --> 01:37:25.348
with the Q at column of B.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18354-0
01:37:25.418 --> 01:37:26.828
You get KP Q, correct?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18366-0
01:37:32.948 --> 01:37:33.458
Eat pizza.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18367-0
01:37:32.988 --> 01:37:33.408
Yes or no.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18402-0
01:37:34.488 --> 01:37:38.752
You take the if I want to find
the IJ element of the product A

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18402-1
01:37:38.752 --> 01:37:42.542
into CI, take the I throw of A
and the J throw of C and

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18402-2
01:37:42.542 --> 01:37:45.588
multiply them together and add
them correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18412-0
01:37:49.428 --> 01:37:50.088
Pearson.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18435-0
01:37:51.228 --> 01:37:55.005
So if you want KP, PQ, tellement
you take the P row of B

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18435-1
01:37:55.005 --> 01:37:58.518
transpose and Q at row B and
multiply them together.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18444-0
01:37:59.748 --> 01:38:02.538
Now you can try this very
clearly.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18492-0
01:38:02.588 --> 01:38:09.335
So KP QS, the ROP, throw RP
transpose RQ which is nothing

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18492-1
01:38:09.335 --> 01:38:16.431
but BLP into BLQ if you want to
now differentiate KPQ by, uh

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18492-2
01:38:16.431 --> 01:38:20.038
Vijay, it is nothing but BLBLQ.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18502-0
01:38:20.108 --> 01:38:24.239
Now, can I tell you the sequence
of the summation convention

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18502-1
01:38:24.239 --> 01:38:24.578
here?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18516-0
01:38:29.288 --> 01:38:31.348
That how this thing I didn't get
it.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18519-0
01:38:32.348 --> 01:38:32.768
Which one?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18535-0
01:38:34.148 --> 01:38:37.358
And this KP Q called to RP
transpose.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18540-0
01:38:38.278 --> 01:38:38.848
Write it here.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18542-0
01:38:40.008 --> 01:38:40.488
Yes, please.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18544-0
01:38:40.708 --> 01:38:41.098
With it.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18546-0
01:38:42.928 --> 01:38:43.488
I'm saying.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18590-0
01:38:46.068 --> 01:38:53.292
Suppose you have a matrix, let's
say A2 bedroom matrix

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18590-1
01:38:53.292 --> 01:39:00.648
A11A12A21A22, and another matrix
which is B11B12B21B22.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18602-0
01:39:01.418 --> 01:39:03.288
If I multiply these two, what am
I going to get?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18616-0
01:39:06.978 --> 01:39:07.858
A2 by two matrix.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18619-0
01:39:08.278 --> 01:39:09.448
A2 by two matrix.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18623-0
01:39:09.678 --> 01:39:11.458
Now if I say I want.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18632-0
01:39:12.418 --> 01:39:16.688
And this element what is this
element?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18652-0
01:39:16.918 --> 01:39:22.368
Suppose I call it AC11C12C21C22.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18657-0
01:39:22.418 --> 01:39:24.048
I want C-12.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18676-0
01:39:24.478 --> 01:39:28.461
What I do is I will take this
one one the 1st to the 1st row

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18676-1
01:39:28.461 --> 01:39:28.788
of a.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18689-0
01:39:29.178 --> 01:39:31.778
The two refers here to the
second column of B, correct?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18693-0
01:39:32.328 --> 01:39:32.638
That.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18717-0
01:39:33.538 --> 01:39:42.948
I multiply this so I will get a
11B12 plus A12B22 correct that.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18721-0
01:39:41.838 --> 01:39:42.108
Yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18722-0
01:39:42.908 --> 01:39:43.048
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18723-0
01:39:42.958 --> 01:39:43.658
Did you see one too?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18732-0
01:39:47.218 --> 01:39:51.758
OK, so if you have B.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18729-0
01:39:48.048 --> 01:39:48.318
Correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18747-0
01:39:52.948 --> 01:39:58.268
Belongs to RM Cross N Now what
is B transpose B?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18766-0
01:40:00.738 --> 01:40:01.498
In closing.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18771-0
01:40:00.968 --> 01:40:03.528
It belong to RN crossing
correct?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18774-0
01:40:04.068 --> 01:40:04.288
Umm.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18783-0
01:40:05.108 --> 01:40:07.208
OK, now the question is this.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18791-0
01:40:07.218 --> 01:40:09.438
B transpose B is called as your
kid.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18799-0
01:40:10.638 --> 01:40:10.918
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18804-0
01:40:12.118 --> 01:40:13.378
So what is the size of K?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18812-0
01:40:14.248 --> 01:40:14.878
And crossing.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18817-0
01:40:15.338 --> 01:40:16.968
OK, then crossing matrix.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18820-0
01:40:17.458 --> 01:40:19.258
Now I denote let.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18829-0
01:40:20.898 --> 01:40:22.238
He have the Rose.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18842-0
01:40:23.038 --> 01:40:26.728
Is this the first row R one
second row is R2?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18850-0
01:40:27.928 --> 01:40:28.998
What will be the Anthro?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18855-0
01:40:29.808 --> 01:40:30.088
Pardon.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/18875-0
01:40:30.738 --> 01:40:37.588
Uh, if this is the site kind of

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19091-0
01:41:30.808 --> 01:41:31.528
What is the definition?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19121-0
01:41:37.828 --> 01:41:40.438
Is it not RRP transpose?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19113-0
01:41:38.278 --> 01:41:39.448

01:41:53.478 --> 01:41:54.878
What is acute column of B?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19163-0
01:41:57.228 --> 01:41:57.788

Thank you.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19171-0
01:42:01.268 --> 01:42:02.528
Happy transfer software.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19181-0
01:42:08.958 --> 01:42:09.858
Is it not the same thing?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19182-0
01:42:10.518 --> 01:42:10.738
Right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19194-0
01:42:13.948 --> 01:42:16.498
So you can write it as BLP BLQ
correct?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19204-0
01:42:20.228 --> 01:42:23.938
Why is it RQ and not are you
transpose?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19212-0
01:42:26.478 --> 01:42:27.628
Why are you transpose?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19227-0
01:42:29.158 --> 01:42:33.428
Which argue is represented by a
row right the Q row.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19229-0
01:42:32.518 --> 01:42:32.698
Yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19253-0
01:42:36.528 --> 01:42:40.593
Now in this in this what has
happened is you can do it two

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19250-0
01:42:39.328 --> 01:42:39.448
But.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19253-1
01:42:40.593 --> 01:42:40.938
ways.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19278-0
01:42:41.228 --> 01:42:46.964
If you take the 8th column of B
to BBI, then and they should

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19278-1
01:42:46.964 --> 01:42:50.538
actually not be, AMBI should be
a RI.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19287-0
01:42:51.878 --> 01:42:52.488
Facebook.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19291-0
01:42:53.238 --> 01:42:54.328
Christina is there.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19294-0
01:42:54.338 --> 01:42:54.978
APARNA is there.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19299-0
01:43:03.448 --> 01:43:03.918
Godding.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19314-0
01:43:08.258 --> 01:43:10.888
OK, now this is the I8 call
column of B.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19325-0
01:43:10.898 --> 01:43:12.888
So I mean, there is a small
terminology here.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19336-0
01:43:13.258 --> 01:43:17.188
Now you you understood it as the
pH.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19344-0
01:43:18.098 --> 01:43:20.188
It maybe I should write with
respect to this, no?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19367-0
01:43:23.428 --> 01:43:25.608
So it was cured column of B,
right, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19362-0
01:43:25.608 --> 01:43:26.098
No, no, no.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19377-0
01:43:26.108 --> 01:43:29.468
So I will say let RITU be there.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19416-0
01:43:29.778 --> 01:43:30.288
Uh.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19382-0
01:43:31.138 --> 01:43:34.428
I get column coffee.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19384-0
01:43:35.978 --> 01:43:36.178
Yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19391-0
01:43:37.578 --> 01:43:40.818
So he wants this definition.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19401-0
01:43:40.828 --> 01:43:42.648
So this is R1, correct?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19406-0
01:43:43.498 --> 01:43:43.838
Got it.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19413-0
01:43:44.198 --> 01:43:47.278
This is a R2 all the way up to
RANJAN.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19422-0
01:43:49.298 --> 01:43:51.418
Umm OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19418-0
01:43:49.468 --> 01:43:49.748
Correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19428-0
01:43:52.328 --> 01:43:55.198
Now the point is and.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19435-0
01:43:55.808 --> 01:43:58.278
So now you want to find KP Q.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19438-0
01:43:58.288 --> 01:43:59.828
This is P.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19456-0
01:44:01.228 --> 01:44:09.518
Roll off be transpose times
Hewlett column of be correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19460-0
01:44:10.078 --> 01:44:10.218
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19469-0
01:44:11.188 --> 01:44:13.738
So what is a P row of V
transpose?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19490-0
01:44:17.058 --> 01:44:19.428
It's the Piatt column of B.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19484-0
01:44:19.018 --> 01:44:19.748
Uh, Piet.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19497-0
01:44:19.758 --> 01:44:20.718
Column of B.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19500-0
01:44:20.158 --> 01:44:21.728
This is a RP transpose.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19498-0
01:44:20.548 --> 01:44:21.048
OK, OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19503-0
01:44:22.948 --> 01:44:23.418
Times.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19505-0
01:44:23.888 --> 01:44:24.588
Are you correct?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19512-0
01:44:26.438 --> 01:44:26.678
Right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19517-0
01:44:27.828 --> 01:44:28.418
That's what he said.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19515-0
01:44:28.618 --> 01:44:28.998
What?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19518-0
01:44:29.458 --> 01:44:30.008
Why?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19529-0
01:44:30.198 --> 01:44:31.968
Why are we saying are we
transpose here?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19532-0
01:44:31.978 --> 01:44:32.458
If we are saying?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19536-0
01:44:34.278 --> 01:44:34.988
No, you can't.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19547-0
01:44:34.998 --> 01:44:36.938
You when you come the row you
need a row.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19551-0
01:44:38.238 --> 01:44:38.868
Aries.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19556-0
01:44:38.658 --> 01:44:39.088
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19564-0
01:44:38.878 --> 01:44:39.688
Are you father?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19558-0
01:44:39.098 --> 01:44:39.468
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19560-0
01:44:39.478 --> 01:44:39.708
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19576-0
01:44:39.718 --> 01:44:40.158
Sorry, sorry.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19583-0
01:44:40.078 --> 01:44:41.418
So I have to convert it to them.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19578-0
01:44:40.168 --> 01:44:40.798
Sorry, I understood.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19581-0
01:44:41.608 --> 01:44:41.868
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19592-0
01:44:41.878 --> 01:44:42.518
It's just the notion.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19594-0
01:44:43.398 --> 01:44:44.458
It does it notation.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19598-0
01:44:44.468 --> 01:44:44.928
That's it.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19609-0
01:44:45.078 --> 01:44:45.998
Yeah. OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19637-0
01:44:45.458 --> 01:44:49.256
Now you see, whenever you have
BLPBLQ and you want

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19637-1
01:44:49.256 --> 01:44:53.948
differentiate with respect to
IJ, this will be done by Don BA,

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19637-2
01:44:53.948 --> 01:44:54.618
JBL, BLQ.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19642-0
01:44:55.118 --> 01:44:57.978
Now this has how many
parameters.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19652-0
01:45:00.728 --> 01:45:02.318
This has four parameters, not
five.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19655-0
01:45:02.328 --> 01:45:02.828
But you know why.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19670-0
01:45:06.228 --> 01:45:09.418
From the outside, it looks like
I JP QL.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19679-0
01:45:09.428 --> 01:45:10.798
The five parameters are right,
no?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19682-0
01:45:10.808 --> 01:45:11.698
But it just doesn't.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19698-0
01:45:11.708 --> 01:45:16.146
That's only four because the L
is being summed up, so Li is

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19698-1
01:45:16.146 --> 01:45:17.478
getting summed up.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19717-0
01:45:17.488 --> 01:45:21.418
So it has only four parameters,
so it's a parameter of PQ ING.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19732-0
01:45:21.908 --> 01:45:26.926
Now there are several cases
depending upon how this PQ&amp;J

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19732-1
01:45:26.926 --> 01:45:28.078
values differ.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19739-0
01:45:28.348 --> 01:45:29.138
So we have got.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19777-0
01:45:29.148 --> 01:45:35.239
So this is equal to BIQ and if J
equal to P&amp;P not equal to Q,

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19777-1
01:45:35.239 --> 01:45:40.038
this is equal to be IP J equal
to QP in octal to Q.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19794-0
01:45:40.738 --> 01:45:44.808
You can have a case with JJ
equal to P&amp;P equal to Q.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19820-0
01:45:45.238 --> 01:45:48.796
Now if you have zero when all
the other things are different,

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19820-1
01:45:48.796 --> 01:45:51.838
see for example if all the
things are different now.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19839-0
01:45:51.878 --> 01:45:57.528
Li S7P is 9 and the Q is 12 and
I is 4 and J is 7.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19855-0
01:45:57.818 --> 01:46:01.568
Then you have this to be getting
it to be equal to 0 anyway.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19860-0
01:46:01.818 --> 01:46:04.108
This is the Jacobian
computation.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19869-0
01:46:04.678 --> 01:46:07.698
There are some identities which
are quite helpful.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19874-0
01:46:07.708 --> 01:46:09.168
These identities are pretty
long.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19881-0
01:46:09.178 --> 01:46:10.498
Not that they are boring.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19890-0
01:46:10.508 --> 01:46:11.898
These are pretty long to prove.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19934-0
01:46:12.488 --> 01:46:17.021
We have just tainted and this
will take quite some effort to

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19934-1
01:46:17.021 --> 01:46:21.405
prove these theorems the TR
refers to the trace and if you

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19934-2
01:46:21.405 --> 01:46:25.418
want I can ask the TS to work
out one or two of them.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19939-0
01:46:25.428 --> 01:46:26.598
If somebody is interested.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19948-0
01:46:27.088 --> 01:46:29.738
Otherwise, a book on vector
calculus will be good enough.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19962-0
01:46:29.748 --> 01:46:32.698
We are not going to ask any
proof of these theorems or

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19962-1
01:46:32.698 --> 01:46:33.288
identities.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19980-0
01:46:33.298 --> 01:46:36.899
So you can just take it granted
and you can use it in the

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19980-1
01:46:36.899 --> 01:46:37.458
problems.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19985-0
01:46:37.908 --> 01:46:38.958
The same thing here.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/19995-0
01:46:39.048 --> 01:46:42.928
I did one of them, for example X
transpose X.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20006-0
01:46:43.148 --> 01:46:45.598
Can I speak to XRS or whatever
it is?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20017-0
01:46:45.928 --> 01:46:48.618
So this is what we did in the
class today, right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20028-0
01:46:55.028 --> 01:46:55.288
Right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20040-0
01:46:56.078 --> 01:46:59.168
He did this today and you see a
similar extension of.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20070-0
01:46:59.178 --> 01:47:02.259
This will be this only thing is
you have to do a small

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20070-1
01:47:02.259 --> 01:47:05.228
transformation and then you
chain rule for doing it.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20095-0
01:47:05.598 --> 01:47:09.580
But my suggestion is not to get
deeper into this and then try to

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20095-1
01:47:09.580 --> 01:47:12.398
use these results wherever they
are possible.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20107-0
01:47:13.438 --> 01:47:17.062
Now we come to something which
is automatic differentiation and

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20107-1
01:47:17.062 --> 01:47:17.968
backpropagation.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20117-0
01:47:17.978 --> 01:47:18.798
People are aware of this.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20120-0
01:47:19.048 --> 01:47:21.218
The neural networks?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20131-0
01:47:21.278 --> 01:47:23.868
Or should I give a small
introduction to neural networks?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20151-0
01:47:26.238 --> 01:47:27.138
Introduction please, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20150-0
01:47:26.578 --> 01:47:26.818
Is.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20157-0
01:47:26.708 --> 01:47:28.038
Didn't connection is required.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20163-0
01:47:28.858 --> 01:47:30.478
OK, nobody knows neural
networks.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20160-0
01:47:28.938 --> 01:47:29.338
Introduction.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20178-0
01:47:32.008 --> 01:47:32.388
No, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20184-0
01:47:32.848 --> 01:47:33.298
No, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20175-0
01:47:33.028 --> 01:47:34.138
That's not montage for me.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20185-0
01:47:34.148 --> 01:47:34.808
I can tell whatever.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20186-0
01:47:34.448 --> 01:47:34.988
I don't know.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20204-0
01:47:37.468 --> 01:47:39.218
OK, so I will tell you what is.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20206-0
01:47:38.388 --> 01:47:40.068
We know, Sir, but not in the Max
way.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20217-0
01:47:41.748 --> 01:47:43.818
No, no you in anyway, so I will.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20238-0
01:47:43.828 --> 01:47:46.505
I'm gonna tell you in your your
way only so you can correct me

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20238-1
01:47:46.505 --> 01:47:47.058
if I'm wrong.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20249-0
01:47:47.448 --> 01:47:49.858
So what happens is you have a
set of inputs.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20268-0
01:47:54.118 --> 01:47:56.908
And you have a set of outputs
they need not be the same size.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20274-0
01:47:58.338 --> 01:47:59.898
Who said he you.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20281-0
01:48:00.038 --> 01:48:00.928
You know, in the practical way.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20297-0
01:48:02.638 --> 01:48:04.888
Answer me also, I know
practically up.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20299-0
01:48:05.228 --> 01:48:06.228
OK, tell me your name now.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20303-0
01:48:06.758 --> 01:48:07.158
Plugin.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20312-0
01:48:08.498 --> 01:48:09.278
I think it hear you.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20314-0
01:48:09.908 --> 01:48:10.778
A plug and plug in.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20330-0
01:48:12.228 --> 01:48:15.718
OK, so this is the input and
this is the output there.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20345-0
01:48:16.008 --> 01:48:19.678
So you have 5 parameters input
and then you have 3 output

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20345-1
01:48:19.678 --> 01:48:20.628
parameters. OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20354-0
01:48:22.808 --> 01:48:24.258
Now I want to model this.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20362-0
01:48:24.528 --> 01:48:26.668
So what I what people do in?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20381-0
01:48:28.628 --> 01:48:33.178
Uh, in neural networks is they
try to bring some layers here.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20391-0
01:48:34.118 --> 01:48:36.978
It can be 12345.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20396-0
01:48:36.988 --> 01:48:38.498
Any number of layers can be
brought.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20430-0
01:48:40.708 --> 01:48:44.854
And what they do is they
introduce some weights WI and

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20430-1
01:48:44.854 --> 01:48:49.679
there is some BI they have a set
of parameters which are coming

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20430-2
01:48:49.679 --> 01:48:51.338
from each one of them.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20444-0
01:48:51.868 --> 01:48:55.918
So what they do is they take the
input, they map it again.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20458-0
01:48:55.928 --> 01:48:59.058
So from here there are outputs
going here and there.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20470-0
01:48:59.328 --> 01:49:02.768
And finally, from the last one
you get something to the output.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20484-0
01:49:03.308 --> 01:49:07.018
Now this is how they model the
the neural network.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20529-0
01:49:07.508 --> 01:49:13.399
So typically you have basically
linear algebra which says that

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20529-1
01:49:13.399 --> 01:49:19.196
if you want to model, if you
want to see the output here this

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20529-2
01:49:19.196 --> 01:49:24.806
is nothing but a A W + b for
some suitable weights and some

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20529-3
01:49:24.806 --> 01:49:25.648
pee pees.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20536-0
01:49:25.658 --> 01:49:27.318
Again, it's a set of.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20546-0
01:49:29.188 --> 01:49:30.778
It's a set of it's it's.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20556-0
01:49:30.788 --> 01:49:33.178
It belongs to RN and it is a set
of parameters.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20588-0
01:49:33.608 --> 01:49:37.724
Now you play around with this
W&amp;B and you say that you

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20588-1
01:49:37.724 --> 01:49:41.979
know at the end of this you will
get a W + B which is output

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20588-2
01:49:41.979 --> 01:49:42.398
again.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20605-0
01:49:42.408 --> 01:49:45.688
You pass it on to this layer and
this layer and this layer.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20614-0
01:49:45.868 --> 01:49:47.298
Finally, you'll get the output
layer.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20624-0
01:49:48.738 --> 01:49:51.528
Now there is something which is
called an activation.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20668-0
01:49:51.578 --> 01:49:54.896
I don't know how this is going
to be brought out, but then I

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20668-1
01:49:54.896 --> 01:49:58.486
call this activation function as
Sigma I and I say that at the at

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20668-2
01:49:58.486 --> 01:50:01.858
the end of every stage you you
just try to do this activation

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20668-3
01:50:01.858 --> 01:50:02.348
function.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20698-0
01:50:02.618 --> 01:50:06.072
So I'll come to talk about it a
little later, but for the

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20698-1
01:50:06.072 --> 01:50:09.467
present, I am saying that you
need to differentiate this

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20698-2
01:50:09.467 --> 01:50:12.028
function with respect to
something like X.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20722-0
01:50:12.558 --> 01:50:16.298
Now what we do is you can
differentiate it directly using

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20722-1
01:50:16.298 --> 01:50:20.168
the using the chain rule, but
there is one more good thing.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20737-0
01:50:20.538 --> 01:50:23.008
Do you see that the X ^2 + E
power X square?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20742-0
01:50:23.018 --> 01:50:24.948
And here they are exactly the
same.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20745-0
01:50:27.318 --> 01:50:27.548
Right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20760-0
01:50:28.998 --> 01:50:31.374
Ladies, a square root function
here and there is a cost

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20760-1
01:50:31.374 --> 01:50:31.968
function here.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20776-0
01:50:31.978 --> 01:50:34.828
And what is inheriting both of
them is a plus sign in between.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20788-0
01:50:35.398 --> 01:50:38.448
Now I can draw it as a
diagrammatic stuff.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20804-0
01:50:38.618 --> 01:50:42.288
Now this is what I said as the
neural network implementation.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20828-0
01:50:43.708 --> 01:50:49.304
If you give an input I get I I
throw a knot and B not I get the

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20828-1
01:50:49.304 --> 01:50:51.578
intermediate output again.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20836-0
01:50:51.648 --> 01:50:52.458
They give it here.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20847-0
01:50:52.468 --> 01:50:54.838
I will get A1 and B1 again.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20852-0
01:50:54.848 --> 01:50:55.608
I give it here.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20897-0
01:50:55.618 --> 01:51:01.517
Then I I get at the end stage A
K -, 1, B, K, -, 1 which is my

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20897-1
01:51:01.517 --> 01:51:07.322
FK and I will define my F1 as
some activation of AI minus One

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20897-2
01:51:07.322 --> 01:51:10.038
X I, -, 1, plus bi minus one.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20926-0
01:51:10.488 --> 01:51:13.150
Now this is going to be a vector
and this is going to be a

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20926-1
01:51:13.150 --> 01:51:16.038
vector, so this is a vector and
Sigma is a activation function.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20951-0
01:51:16.248 --> 01:51:19.336
Now, don't worry about this
activation function, whether it

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20951-1
01:51:19.336 --> 01:51:22.528
is sigmoid function, whether it
is epor X by 1 plus epower X.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20992-0
01:51:22.538 --> 01:51:26.061
These are all various industry
standards and possibly if I get

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20992-1
01:51:26.061 --> 01:51:29.304
an opportunity to do deep
learning I will do this several

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/20992-2
01:51:29.304 --> 01:51:32.548
kinds of sigmas and you can have
implementation that too.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21028-0
01:51:32.938 --> 01:51:37.020
But for the now for the present
you say that given input I have

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21028-1
01:51:37.020 --> 01:51:41.102
a not B not and then you get one
output function F based on one

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21028-2
01:51:41.102 --> 01:51:43.908
excitation function or
activation function.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21064-0
01:51:44.258 --> 01:51:47.981
Then again, after that you'll
get A1B1 and so on and up to a K

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21064-1
01:51:47.981 --> 01:51:51.528
minus and B K -, 1 as a FK, and
then you'll get the output.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21096-0
01:51:52.968 --> 01:51:58.282
Now I defined yet not to be
equal to X and each offer it to

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21096-1
01:51:58.282 --> 01:52:04.128
be equal to Sigma I AI minus one
Sai minus one plus BI minus one.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21111-0
01:52:05.178 --> 01:52:08.548
Now the idea is we have to find
the set of all parameters.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21157-0
01:52:08.558 --> 01:52:13.602
What are the parameters the AJ
and BJ are the parameters media

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21157-1
01:52:13.602 --> 01:52:18.645
J is A is a matrix and BJ is a
vector such that the difference

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21157-2
01:52:18.645 --> 01:52:21.688
between Y and FK in the in the
Spire.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21161-0
01:52:21.698 --> 01:52:23.048
The error is minimal.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21188-0
01:52:23.498 --> 01:52:27.247
Now you have to find all these
elements are not B, not A1B1UP

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21188-1
01:52:27.247 --> 01:52:28.698
to a K -, b K minus one.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21200-0
01:52:28.708 --> 01:52:31.588
This is similar to what we what
I told us.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21205-0
01:52:31.598 --> 01:52:32.878
A loss function earlier on.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21224-0
01:52:35.128 --> 01:52:38.778
Now you can use chain rule and
you can get a lot of things.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21243-0
01:52:38.788 --> 01:52:42.838
For example, doyal by dot dot K
-, 1 is done by Dou.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21256-0
01:52:42.848 --> 01:52:45.258
FK does FK by Dot dot K minus
when.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21277-0
01:52:45.268 --> 01:52:49.298
You can do this again and again
till you get into this Theta I

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21277-1
01:52:49.298 --> 01:52:49.618
form.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21304-0
01:52:50.488 --> 01:52:55.248
So starting from K -, 1, you can
come up to the ith form by using

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21304-1
01:52:55.248 --> 01:52:59.288
simply the chain rule and using
the result recursively.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21315-0
01:53:00.648 --> 01:53:02.358
Now this is what you are going
to get?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21322-0
01:53:02.368 --> 01:53:04.698
Uh recursively from the
backside.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21328-0
01:53:04.948 --> 01:53:05.678
So you get.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21341-0
01:53:05.688 --> 01:53:09.518
From this you get this you from
here you get this and so on.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21372-0
01:53:09.528 --> 01:53:13.308
You can compute DLL by dot data
if you want to come to the H Now

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21372-1
01:53:13.308 --> 01:53:16.158
I'm going to exemplify that in a
simple process.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21383-0
01:53:16.168 --> 01:53:17.898
Here what is a simple process
here?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21390-0
01:53:18.288 --> 01:53:19.358
I'm going to draw a diagram.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21394-0
01:53:20.738 --> 01:53:21.678
You are there with me.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21403-0
01:53:24.358 --> 01:53:25.038
Yes, Sir. Yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21416-0
01:53:25.998 --> 01:53:30.028
I take an Excel, I pass it onto
a square function.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21421-0
01:53:30.038 --> 01:53:31.078
So what is output here?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21431-0
01:53:34.138 --> 01:53:34.758
X square.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21436-0
01:53:34.848 --> 01:53:35.408
X ^2.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21433-0
01:53:35.228 --> 01:53:35.868
Esquire.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21440-0
01:53:36.718 --> 01:53:37.918
I pass it on too.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21448-0
01:53:40.078 --> 01:53:41.168
Appoint a.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21464-0
01:53:41.458 --> 01:53:43.578
Now what a what is being what is
being stored?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21473-0
01:53:44.278 --> 01:53:44.898
X square.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21474-0
01:53:44.618 --> 01:53:45.188
X square.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21483-0
01:53:45.238 --> 01:53:49.038
Explore now a gives it to Exp of
a.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21478-0
01:53:45.258 --> 01:53:45.618
It's good.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21493-0
01:53:50.118 --> 01:53:50.788
So what is it?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21514-0
01:53:51.788 --> 01:53:54.088
Exponential of X ^2 Yep.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21509-0
01:53:52.108 --> 01:53:53.088
Yes, world.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21511-0
01:53:53.198 --> 01:53:53.838
X square.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21517-0
01:53:53.358 --> 01:53:55.608
Exponentially expanding we just
stored in B.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21519-0
01:53:56.298 --> 01:53:56.618
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21553-0
01:53:56.918 --> 01:53:57.158
Good.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21540-0
01:53:57.878 --> 01:54:02.129
Now one, once they come here, I
get the AC output and

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21540-1
01:54:02.129 --> 01:54:03.468
exponential of B.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21556-0
01:54:03.478 --> 01:54:06.898
So it'll be X ^2 plus
exponential of X ^2 correct?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21568-0
01:54:06.478 --> 01:54:07.658
X square, right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21572-0
01:54:07.688 --> 01:54:09.378
That is what is getting stored
in C, right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21569-0
01:54:07.918 --> 01:54:08.038
Yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21571-0
01:54:08.128 --> 01:54:08.528
You too.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21577-0
01:54:09.928 --> 01:54:10.208
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21586-0
01:54:11.248 --> 01:54:13.408
T will pass it on to two things.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21585-0
01:54:11.688 --> 01:54:12.088
Listen.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21593-0
01:54:13.418 --> 01:54:15.818
See will do a spiral function.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21599-0
01:54:15.828 --> 01:54:16.708
So what is stored in D?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21636-0
01:54:18.718 --> 01:54:21.298
Root of X square plus
exponential of X square.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21638-0
01:54:19.058 --> 01:54:21.658
In the root of X ^2 plus
exponential of X ^2.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21632-0
01:54:20.718 --> 01:54:21.728
Ohh OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21641-0
01:54:21.958 --> 01:54:24.268
The sea will also go to cost
function.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21650-0
01:54:24.278 --> 01:54:25.418
So what is stored in E?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21672-0
01:54:26.398 --> 01:54:28.928
Also fix square plus exponential
of X square.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21669-0
01:54:27.608 --> 01:54:28.248
Or something.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21680-0
01:54:28.208 --> 01:54:31.668
OK, now you add D&amp;E, you get
in here, correct?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21676-0
01:54:29.258 --> 01:54:29.518
Right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21682-0
01:54:32.168 --> 01:54:32.448
Correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21685-0
01:54:33.158 --> 01:54:33.728
OK, fine.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21696-0
01:54:34.578 --> 01:54:38.088
Now the question is you want to
find DF DX.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21702-0
01:54:39.648 --> 01:54:39.908
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21716-0
01:54:41.098 --> 01:54:45.568
So you can use recursively from
the back, so you find, so can.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21723-0
01:54:45.578 --> 01:54:47.158
Can we do this problem here
itself?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21739-0
01:54:48.708 --> 01:54:49.938
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21971-0
01:55:33.818 --> 01:55:34.158
To it.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21968-0
01:55:34.028 --> 01:55:34.578
To do.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21983-0
01:55:34.588 --> 01:55:34.908
Weeks.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21985-0
01:55:34.758 --> 01:55:35.268
Waits.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21988-0
01:55:34.998 --> 01:55:35.518
2 eggs.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/21997-0
01:55:35.838 --> 01:55:39.138
You take a paper and you write
all these things down.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22004-0
01:55:39.508 --> 01:55:40.858
Do it by Dory.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22007-0
01:55:39.738 --> 01:55:39.948
Uh-huh.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22010-0
01:55:40.868 --> 01:55:42.058
Do F by Dory.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22031-0
01:55:42.068 --> 01:55:45.528
Dory by do see all these things
I have written it for you here.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22041-0
01:55:46.478 --> 01:55:46.798
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22063-0
01:55:47.138 --> 01:55:51.595
DWIVEDI X is 2X but I will go
from the from the from the last

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22063-1
01:55:51.595 --> 01:55:53.248
step to the first step.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22071-0
01:55:52.108 --> 01:55:53.868
Bottom OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22095-0
01:55:53.598 --> 01:55:57.644
The bottom up do FY dot E equal
to does by Dou E similar doc by

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22095-1
01:55:57.644 --> 01:55:58.908
Dou equal doc by do.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22110-0
01:55:59.498 --> 01:56:03.248
Now what you do is you can find
any of the partial derivatives.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22102-0
01:55:59.868 --> 01:56:00.108
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22120-0
01:56:03.258 --> 01:56:04.868
What is do F by Doc?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22126-0
01:56:04.918 --> 01:56:07.148
You want to differentiate F with
respect to everything.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22134-0
01:56:09.318 --> 01:56:10.518
Yeah, intermediate.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22150-0
01:56:10.528 --> 01:56:13.998
You find those by Don E, but I'm
not interested in dosey Doe.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22163-0
01:56:14.008 --> 01:56:15.758
I am interested in do FBO
correct?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22169-0
01:56:16.528 --> 01:56:16.998
That right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22203-0
01:56:17.418 --> 01:56:21.447
Or do I have to do it so I will
first find what is do if by

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22203-1
01:56:21.447 --> 01:56:25.208
Dorsey the Wi-Fi dosis do, if by
Dodie, why is this so?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22212-0
01:56:27.668 --> 01:56:27.958
No.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22214-0
01:56:27.968 --> 01:56:29.228
If they don't C.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22222-0
01:56:31.938 --> 01:56:32.188
No.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22230-0
01:56:32.198 --> 01:56:34.088
If by Doc C is equal to.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22240-0
01:56:36.568 --> 01:56:36.938
Do you?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22243-0
01:56:36.698 --> 01:56:37.008
No.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22259-0
01:56:36.948 --> 01:56:39.038
Why Dodi into Dodi?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22273-0
01:56:37.018 --> 01:56:42.188
Yes, by Noyes by do D exactly
correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22272-0
01:56:38.358 --> 01:56:40.908
Don't need dordy by doc.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22269-0
01:56:39.068 --> 01:56:39.658
By Joshi.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22305-0
01:56:42.598 --> 01:56:48.034
So you will find FF will be
equal to F will be a function of

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22305-1
01:56:48.034 --> 01:56:52.935
and KENDRE, right and D&amp;E
are both functions of C,

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22305-2
01:56:52.935 --> 01:56:53.648
correct?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22319-0
01:56:55.578 --> 01:56:56.088
Yes, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22350-0
01:56:55.728 --> 01:57:01.848
The dough if by Doc is nothing
but does F by Dou D into do D by

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22343-0
01:57:01.618 --> 01:57:02.768
Who did my those thing?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22350-1
01:57:01.848 --> 01:57:04.908
DOC plus do F by Don E into Dou.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22354-0
01:57:05.148 --> 01:57:06.278
Dou EEOC.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22367-0
01:57:06.688 --> 01:57:08.578
You will find those two answers.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22362-0
01:57:07.078 --> 01:57:07.398
Correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22381-0
01:57:08.848 --> 01:57:12.398
You will find those by Dobby
does by Dobby.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22374-0
01:57:09.138 --> 01:57:09.448
Correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22393-0
01:57:12.408 --> 01:57:16.338
If you see Don B, it will not
have any component, right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22401-0
01:57:19.458 --> 01:57:20.128
No component.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22426-0
01:57:20.528 --> 01:57:25.032
Why do if by DOHC into DOC by
Doab there is no other does by

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22426-1
01:57:25.032 --> 01:57:28.208
Dou E has nothing on on this
correct on B?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22433-0
01:57:30.008 --> 01:57:30.658
Yeah, yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22448-0
01:57:30.668 --> 01:57:32.228
He's nothing to do with me.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22460-0
01:57:31.918 --> 01:57:36.948
OK, so you will do this though,
if by Dobby now do F by do a.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22471-0
01:57:36.958 --> 01:57:38.868
Also, you'll do similarly and
then you'll find.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22488-0
01:57:38.878 --> 01:57:42.888
Finally, do F by Dou X is 2F by
Dou N.W.A by do X.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22496-0
01:57:43.258 --> 01:57:43.518
Alright.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22539-0
01:57:43.318 --> 01:57:47.291
So you will you will do the he
will do the similar arithmetic

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22539-1
01:57:47.291 --> 01:57:51.329
and at the end of the arithmetic
you will get you will get the

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22539-2
01:57:51.329 --> 01:57:55.559
same thing but this is in no way
simpler compared to the original

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22539-3
01:57:55.559 --> 01:57:56.008
things.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22590-0
01:57:56.018 --> 01:58:00.110
Originally we are doing the same
thing, but it is one example to

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22590-1
01:58:00.110 --> 01:58:03.446
say how this bags back
propagation is used in neural

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22590-2
01:58:03.446 --> 01:58:07.475
network set from the back we are
going to come to the front and

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22590-3
01:58:07.475 --> 01:58:09.238
this is what has to be done.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22596-0
01:58:10.278 --> 01:58:11.908
But but both are same right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22611-0
01:58:10.868 --> 01:58:13.378
Now what they're saying, what?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22618-0
01:58:12.198 --> 01:58:13.478
Both is the same result.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22615-0
01:58:13.388 --> 01:58:14.358
We don't know.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22626-0
01:58:14.428 --> 01:58:15.578
This is one day an example.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22639-0
01:58:15.588 --> 01:58:18.018
I'm not saying this is the best
way to do differentiation.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22652-0
01:58:18.508 --> 01:58:22.081
I'm saying in the neural network
form, I'm going to come from the

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22652-1
01:58:22.081 --> 01:58:22.298
sea.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22691-0
01:58:22.608 --> 01:58:26.901
The neural network form I know
the set of outputs only, so I

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22691-1
01:58:26.901 --> 01:58:31.336
had to come to this stage this
stage, this stage and then come

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22675-0
01:58:27.978 --> 01:58:28.178
Right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22691-2
01:58:31.336 --> 01:58:33.588
here to get my parameters fixed.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22701-0
01:58:32.088 --> 01:58:34.138
Right. Mm-hmm.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22706-0
01:58:33.888 --> 01:58:36.063
That's what an example of that
is the automatic

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22706-1
01:58:36.063 --> 01:58:36.788
differentiation.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22709-0
01:58:38.838 --> 01:58:39.218
Agreed.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22712-0
01:58:40.098 --> 01:58:40.378
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22755-0
01:58:41.238 --> 01:58:46.822
OK, now this X1 to XD are input
variable so this is for example

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22755-1
01:58:46.822 --> 01:58:52.144
the final output you have D
input variables d + 1 to capital

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22755-2
01:58:52.144 --> 01:58:57.118
d -, 1 intermediate variables
and XD is output variable.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22777-0
01:58:58.158 --> 01:59:01.278
Now you're the check all the
parent nodes how they are

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22777-1
01:59:01.278 --> 01:59:03.548
connected, wherever they are
connected.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22791-0
01:59:03.558 --> 01:59:06.318
You have to use the chain rule
and go for the differentiation.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22800-0
01:59:07.748 --> 01:59:10.918
OK, now now if you see.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22798-0
01:59:08.658 --> 01:59:08.938
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22805-0
01:59:10.928 --> 01:59:12.158
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22817-0
01:59:12.168 --> 01:59:14.188
Please XD So what is do I do XD?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22821-0
01:59:15.618 --> 01:59:15.898
1.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22852-0
01:59:16.318 --> 01:59:20.379
One better as if you want to
find do F by Dou XI XI is any

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22852-1
01:59:20.379 --> 01:59:24.371
one of them them in one to D you
have to come through the

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22852-2
01:59:24.371 --> 01:59:26.298
intermediate stages correct?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22860-0
01:59:27.178 --> 01:59:27.458
Correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22862-0
01:59:28.348 --> 01:59:29.018
So you'll fight.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22881-0
01:59:29.028 --> 01:59:33.712
Does X by Dou X something the
parent node into Don Xavier do X

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22881-1
01:59:33.712 --> 01:59:34.158
right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22900-0
01:59:34.428 --> 01:59:39.598
You do this recursively and you
will get a the final output.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22909-0
01:59:40.588 --> 01:59:44.178
So I have successfully completed
this part of it.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22954-0
01:59:44.368 --> 01:59:48.901
I would strongly recommend that
you write down a few things and

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22954-1
01:59:48.901 --> 01:59:53.152
and and and then try to expand
it using the Chroniker delta

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22938-0
01:59:50.698 --> 01:59:51.448
You want to see.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22954-2
01:59:53.152 --> 01:59:55.348
which I have explained earlier.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22950-0
01:59:54.198 --> 01:59:54.248
K.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22984-0
01:59:56.408 --> 02:00:00.798
And then you should be able to
get it if there are any things

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22984-1
02:00:00.798 --> 02:00:05.329
you can talk to my TTS right to
them or you can correspond with

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22984-2
02:00:05.329 --> 02:00:06.108
me also OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23003-0
02:00:06.678 --> 02:00:07.008
Yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22994-0
02:00:07.978 --> 02:00:09.748
OK, so so Sir, we are.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/22997-0
02:00:08.118 --> 02:00:08.478
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23043-0
02:00:09.798 --> 02:00:14.135
Uh, we are basically having the
output and we are trying to find

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23015-0
02:00:12.598 --> 02:00:13.118
Well, actually.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23043-1
02:00:14.135 --> 02:00:17.538
the input with respect to the
intermediate layers.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23026-0
02:00:15.148 --> 02:00:16.618
No, no, no.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23032-0
02:00:16.628 --> 02:00:17.018
No, no, no.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23034-0
02:00:17.028 --> 02:00:18.098
No, no, no.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23055-0
02:00:18.488 --> 02:00:22.707
What they're trying to do is we
have the output, we have the

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23055-1
02:00:22.707 --> 02:00:23.468
input also.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23066-0
02:00:25.628 --> 02:00:28.008
I want to find the intermediate
set of parameters.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23076-0
02:00:29.688 --> 02:00:32.098
But when we eventually you need
here, you know.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23077-0
02:00:33.098 --> 02:00:33.398
Pardon.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23095-0
02:00:34.028 --> 02:00:36.568
Thank you, but I think.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23096-0
02:00:35.928 --> 02:00:36.908
But anyway we are.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23152-0
02:00:35.998 --> 02:00:39.670
So is it, is it like or it
initially you had shared an

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23111-0
02:00:38.978 --> 02:00:39.458
Yeah, that's.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23152-1
02:00:39.670 --> 02:00:43.410
example when you were asking is
it that that same alpha

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23122-0
02:00:41.278 --> 02:00:42.078
Yeah, exactly.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23152-2
02:00:43.410 --> 02:00:47.549
parameter I mean the variables
that you're talking about that

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23152-3
02:00:47.549 --> 02:00:48.618
we're trying to?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23145-0
02:00:47.708 --> 02:00:48.858
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23157-0
02:00:48.868 --> 02:00:51.078
But only thing is those are
scalars.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23167-0
02:00:51.088 --> 02:00:53.618
Now I'm going to consider
vectors and matrices.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23170-0
02:00:53.678 --> 02:00:53.778
This.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23172-0
02:00:58.508 --> 02:00:58.788
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23181-0
02:01:03.478 --> 02:01:06.488
But how are we finding
intermediate variables, Sir?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23193-0
02:01:06.658 --> 02:01:08.718
I mean we have the output,
that's fine.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23205-0
02:01:08.728 --> 02:01:10.338
But do we have inputs also?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23210-0
02:01:11.048 --> 02:01:12.238
No, we have the inputs.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23221-0
02:01:12.248 --> 02:01:17.058
Also, we have the inputs and we
have the output set.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23237-0
02:01:17.598 --> 02:01:22.578
We what we want to find out is
an intermediate AI and BI.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23243-0
02:01:23.128 --> 02:01:24.498
So we want to find that.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23262-0
02:01:24.568 --> 02:01:28.042
So we will find the loss
function and then you'll try to

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23262-1
02:01:28.042 --> 02:01:29.688
minimize the loss function.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23273-0
02:01:29.698 --> 02:01:33.448
Those minimizers will give this
AI and BI OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23277-0
02:01:34.528 --> 02:01:35.368
OK, OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23289-0
02:01:36.458 --> 02:01:38.468
So that is what will will be
done.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23297-0
02:01:38.478 --> 02:01:39.808
Now this is done in Excel.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23326-0
02:01:39.818 --> 02:01:43.291
Also, I don't know if you have
had an access to to look into

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23326-1
02:01:43.291 --> 02:01:45.568
that or I should show you a
little bit.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23331-0
02:01:46.238 --> 02:01:47.048
Which excel, Sir?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23335-0
02:01:47.798 --> 02:01:48.828
Microsoft Excel only.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23349-0
02:01:49.648 --> 02:01:50.148
No.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23359-0
02:01:50.518 --> 02:01:54.508
What are managed to computer in
Microsoft Excel?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23353-0
02:01:50.658 --> 02:01:51.818
We have your shirt.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23378-0
02:01:55.348 --> 02:02:00.440
Uh, this is the this is
typically done and I'll just

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23378-1
02:02:00.440 --> 02:02:02.458
show you how this is.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23392-0
02:02:02.668 --> 02:02:07.308
You just show me some data, I
will just say equal to Rand.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23401-0
02:02:16.728 --> 02:02:19.988
I'm just thinking random data
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23408-0
02:02:22.218 --> 02:02:22.458
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23414-0
02:02:23.648 --> 02:02:25.188
And then copy and paste it here.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23420-0
02:02:26.318 --> 02:02:28.468
Uh, so that it doesn't change.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23429-0
02:02:31.078 --> 02:02:32.898
OK, this is the problem.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23445-0
02:02:33.938 --> 02:02:38.688
Control C and then it said paste
special values ticket.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23452-0
02:02:38.698 --> 02:02:39.668
Now it will not change.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23457-0
02:02:39.758 --> 02:02:40.348
OK, fine.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23475-0
02:02:40.738 --> 02:02:46.098
Now if you want, I am so this is
some data I've got now.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23487-0
02:02:46.108 --> 02:02:49.798
This is the input and this is
the corresponding output OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23480-0
02:02:46.318 --> 02:02:46.538
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23494-0
02:02:51.298 --> 02:02:51.558
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23501-0
02:02:52.388 --> 02:02:54.838
Now I want to see the
relationship between these two.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23512-0
02:02:54.848 --> 02:02:57.148
Then you can do something called
as a regression analysis.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23527-0
02:02:58.358 --> 02:03:00.958
Kritika you do it in ISM or
should I do it here?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23546-0
02:03:05.628 --> 02:03:09.738
So we do, Sir, but it's easy
and.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23542-0
02:03:09.328 --> 02:03:11.058
OK, OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23554-0
02:03:11.068 --> 02:03:12.998
So what you do is you have.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23560-0
02:03:12.018 --> 02:03:12.678
In formulas.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23579-0
02:03:13.288 --> 02:03:18.470
Yeah, in data you find some data
analysis in data analysis you go

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23579-1
02:03:18.470 --> 02:03:20.668
to histogram, not histogram.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23585-0
02:03:20.678 --> 02:03:21.738
You go to regression.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23610-0
02:03:22.538 --> 02:03:27.491
Sorry, you go to regression and
then say OK, in regression it'll

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23610-1
02:03:27.491 --> 02:03:29.778
say input wire range you just.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23620-0
02:03:32.498 --> 02:03:33.948
You just mark these fellows.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23628-0
02:03:35.168 --> 02:03:36.138
This is your wire range.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23635-0
02:03:36.148 --> 02:03:38.238
You say input X range.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23646-0
02:03:38.648 --> 02:03:41.468
You mark these guys and then say
this is your input range.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23653-0
02:03:42.848 --> 02:03:44.478
Hey, you just click randomly.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23660-0
02:03:44.488 --> 02:03:44.838
Yes.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23667-0
02:03:45.228 --> 02:03:48.218
Now it will say that you are.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23683-0
02:03:48.608 --> 02:03:54.638
The line is basically .255097 of
X + .25.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23690-0
02:03:54.648 --> 02:03:55.338
This is the.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23697-0
02:03:55.408 --> 02:03:57.288
These are the two parameters
which it throws out.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23699-0
02:03:59.358 --> 02:03:59.648
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23703-0
02:04:01.808 --> 02:04:02.108
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23734-0
02:04:03.098 --> 02:04:08.539
Which means the second variable
is nothing but the first

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23734-1
02:04:08.539 --> 02:04:13.408
variable into .255097 + .255 you
want to see that.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23739-0
02:04:15.198 --> 02:04:15.478
Yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23741-0
02:04:16.848 --> 02:04:17.468
Equal to.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23743-0
02:04:20.568 --> 02:04:20.748
This.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23749-0
02:04:25.198 --> 02:04:25.968
.25.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23753-0
02:04:27.268 --> 02:04:28.078
Sheet one.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23761-0
02:04:28.548 --> 02:04:30.008
No, I will put it in dollar.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23762-0
02:04:31.068 --> 02:04:31.508
OK, sure.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23773-0
02:04:33.228 --> 02:04:34.958
Artists happening to all these
things?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23795-0
02:04:34.968 --> 02:04:41.608
I don't know is this cancer now
this is equal to this guy here.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23803-0
02:04:43.108 --> 02:04:46.638
Yeah, this number you put it in
dollar.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23805-0
02:04:49.468 --> 02:04:50.058
*.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23828-0
02:04:53.818 --> 02:05:01.144
Star this number input plus you
put this guy as the outlook plus

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23828-1
02:05:01.144 --> 02:05:02.948
this in dollars.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23830-0
02:05:06.278 --> 02:05:06.548
Stuck.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23832-0
02:05:14.758 --> 02:05:14.958
Now.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23847-0
02:05:16.908 --> 02:05:21.093
This is the best approximation
we could get out of these

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23847-1
02:05:21.093 --> 02:05:22.268
elements. Agree.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23851-0
02:05:25.008 --> 02:05:25.268
OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23857-0
02:05:26.398 --> 02:05:28.348
Now this is quite crude.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23859-0
02:05:28.578 --> 02:05:28.828
Why?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23909-0
02:05:28.838 --> 02:05:32.284
Because the between this random
numbers between zero and one,

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23909-1
02:05:32.284 --> 02:05:35.285
then I mean there is a
correlation is very, very poor

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23909-2
02:05:35.285 --> 02:05:38.787
and you will not be able to get
any sensible stuff if you plot

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23909-3
02:05:38.787 --> 02:05:40.288
this, you will get to know.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23921-0
02:05:40.338 --> 02:05:44.278
I will just plot insert that is
something.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23924-0
02:05:46.708 --> 02:05:46.948
Yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23935-0
02:05:51.618 --> 02:05:53.768
This is how the points look like
agree.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23993-0
02:05:55.528 --> 02:05:55.698
Umm.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23955-0
02:05:56.598 --> 02:06:02.816
Now you will not be able to draw
any kind of line out of this

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23955-1
02:06:02.816 --> 02:06:03.418
stuff.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23962-0
02:06:04.508 --> 02:06:05.638
It slightly bigger.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23967-0
02:06:06.478 --> 02:06:07.798
Be good, be good.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23970-0
02:06:07.148 --> 02:06:07.428
Umm.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/23977-0
02:06:08.338 --> 02:06:09.788
You see, the point is this.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24021-0
02:06:10.038 --> 02:06:14.035
If you have little sensible
things, then it'll be even

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24021-1
02:06:14.035 --> 02:06:18.177
easier to plot this now the the
crux is to get these two

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24021-2
02:06:18.177 --> 02:06:22.247
parameters, so I will get
probably in the next class or

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24021-3
02:06:22.247 --> 02:06:23.628
next to next class.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24036-0
02:06:23.738 --> 02:06:24.988
I will take one example.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24052-0
02:06:24.998 --> 02:06:28.262
I'll work it out by hand, and I
also show it by Excel as to how

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24052-1
02:06:28.262 --> 02:06:29.078
you get that OK.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24050-0
02:06:29.738 --> 02:06:30.088
So.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24062-0
02:06:30.098 --> 02:06:32.948
So by doing that brat back
propagation, we get these two

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24062-1
02:06:32.948 --> 02:06:33.298
values.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24067-0
02:06:35.668 --> 02:06:36.698
Here it is.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24103-0
02:06:36.708 --> 02:06:40.835
Yeah, you can do that way also,
but the neural networks, the

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24103-1
02:06:40.835 --> 02:06:45.165
point is that you are not able
to find your suddenly getting an

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24103-2
02:06:45.165 --> 02:06:46.518
input and an output.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24126-0
02:06:46.648 --> 02:06:49.327
So you think that there are
intermediate stages from the

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24126-1
02:06:49.327 --> 02:06:51.818
input to the output, so how do
you fix those inputs?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24138-0
02:06:52.308 --> 02:06:55.118
How do you fix those
intermediate layers and how?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24151-0
02:06:55.128 --> 02:06:57.350
How do you determine the
parameters determining those

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24151-1
02:06:57.350 --> 02:06:57.638
layers?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24164-0
02:06:57.648 --> 02:06:58.558
That's the crux of the problem.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24162-0
02:06:59.118 --> 02:06:59.748
Understood, Sir.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24172-0
02:06:59.938 --> 02:07:00.368
Good.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24176-0
02:07:00.488 --> 02:07:00.798
Thanks.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24183-0
02:07:00.998 --> 02:07:02.668
Yep, that's what we do, right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24179-0
02:07:01.748 --> 02:07:01.978
Yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24187-0
02:07:01.988 --> 02:07:02.588
Yeah, thanks.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24194-0
02:07:03.118 --> 02:07:04.248
No, that is nature.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24192-0
02:07:03.498 --> 02:07:03.738
Yeah.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24205-0
02:07:03.748 --> 02:07:05.228
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24234-0
02:07:04.738 --> 02:07:08.346
For example, if you, if you if
you meet with an accident and

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24234-1
02:07:08.346 --> 02:07:11.717
you take your car to the
company, what the surveyor does

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24234-2
02:07:11.717 --> 02:07:13.078
is exactly that, right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24248-0
02:07:13.868 --> 02:07:17.435
If your headlight is broken,
that means you have dashed

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24238-0
02:07:14.178 --> 02:07:14.418
Right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24248-1
02:07:17.435 --> 02:07:19.028
against something, right?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24257-0
02:07:21.708 --> 02:07:22.518
Right, right.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24260-0
02:07:22.548 --> 02:07:23.648
That is back propagation.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24284-0
02:07:24.938 --> 02:07:28.404
Now they will not say that you
know, OK, suddenly this error

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24284-1
02:07:28.404 --> 02:07:30.848
was going and he and he got into
accident.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24316-0
02:07:31.398 --> 02:07:34.995
They will examine everything and
then they will say, since there

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24316-1
02:07:34.995 --> 02:07:38.150
is no damage to the front side
of the car, I think it is

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24316-2
02:07:38.150 --> 02:07:39.368
something from behind.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24330-0
02:07:39.678 --> 02:07:42.718
Suppose you have an yellow color
mark in your front side.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24343-0
02:07:42.728 --> 02:07:44.754
That means you're dashed with
some yellow color vehicle,

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24343-1
02:07:44.754 --> 02:07:45.038
correct?

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24353-0
02:07:45.468 --> 02:07:45.758
Correct.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24390-0
02:07:46.178 --> 02:07:48.444
They will do the
backpropagation, so they will

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24390-1
02:07:48.444 --> 02:07:51.434
put some 10 hidden layers in
between the input where you took

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24390-2
02:07:51.434 --> 02:07:54.327
your car from your house till
the accident spotted and they

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24390-3
02:07:54.327 --> 02:07:56.208
will say if this should have
happened.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24395-0
02:07:56.278 --> 02:07:57.408
This should have happened
before.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24400-0
02:07:57.608 --> 02:07:58.558
This should have happened.

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24418-0
02:07:58.568 --> 02:08:01.950
So they're trying to find an AI
and BI at every stage to

539a03f0-fd81-40fd-8613-84320636237d/24418-1
02:08:01.950 --> 02:08:03.018

Right, reverse engineering.

02:08:05.298 --> 02:08:07.538
I didn't want that is what
neural networks does.

OK, OK.
